the golden bowl volume ihenry james book first the princepart firstithe prince had always liked his london when it had come to him he was one of the modern romans who find by the thames a moreconvincing image of the truth of the ancient state than any theyhave left by the tiber brought up on the legend of the city towhich the world paid tribute he recognised in the present londonmuch more than in contemporary rome the real dimensions of such acase if it was a question of an imperium he said to himself and if one wished as a roman to recover a little the sense ofthat the place to do so was on london bridge or even on a fineafternoon in may at hyde park corner it was not indeed toeither of those places that these grounds of his predilection after all sufficiently vague had at the moment we are concernedwith him guided his steps he had strayed simply enough intobond street where his imagination working at comparativelyshort range caused him now and then to stop before a window inwhich objects massive and lumpish in silver and gold in theforms to which precious stones contribute or in leather steel brass applied to a hundred uses and abuses were as tumbledtogether as if in the insolence of the empire they had been theloot of far off victories the young man s movements however betrayed no consistency of attention not even for that matter when one of his arrests had

idea of pursuit he had been pursuing for six months as never in his life before and what had actually unsteadied him as we join him was thesense of how he had been justified capture had crowned thepursuit or success as he would otherwise have put it hadrewarded virtue whereby the consciousness of these things madehim for the hour rather serious than gay a sobriety that mighthave consorted with failure sat in his handsome face constructively regular and grave yet at the same time oddly and as might be functionally almost radiant with its dark blueeyes its dark brown moustache and its expression no more sharply foreign to an english view than to have caused it sometimes tobe observed of him with a shallow felicity that he looked like a refined irishman what had happened was that shortly before atthree o clock his fate had practically been sealed and thateven when one pretended to no quarrel with it the moment hadsomething of the grimness of a crunched key in the strongest lockthat could be made there was nothing to do as yet further butfeel what one had done and our personage felt it while heaimlessly wandered it was already as if he were married sodefinitely had the solicitors at three o clock enabled the dateto be fixed and by so few days was that date now distant hewas to dine at half past eight o clock with the young lady onwhose behalf and on whose father s

itagain by mr verver himself mr verver whose easy way with hismillions had taxed to such small purpose in the arrangements the principle of reciprocity the reciprocity with which theprince was during these minutes most struck was that ofcalderoni s bestowal of his company for a view of the lions ifthere was one thing in the world the young man at this juncture clearly intended it was to be much more decent as a son in lawthan lots of fellows he could think of had shown themselves inthat character he thought of these fellows from whom he was soto differ in english he used mentally the english term todescribe his difference for familiar with the tongue from hisearliest years so that no note of strangeness remained with himeither for lip or for ear he found it convenient in life forthe
