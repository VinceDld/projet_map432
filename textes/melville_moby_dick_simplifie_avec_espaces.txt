moby dick or the whaleby herman melvillechapter loomingscall me ishmael some years ago never mind how long precisely having little or no money in my purse and nothing particularto interest me on shore i thought i would sail about a littleand see the watery part of the world it is a way i haveof driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation whenever i find myself growing grim about the mouth whenever it is a damp drizzly november in my soul whenever ifind myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses and bringing up the rear of every funeral i meet and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me fromdeliberately stepping into the street and methodically knockingpeople s hats off then i account it high time to get to seaas soon as i can this is my substitute for pistol and ball with a philosophical flourish cato throws himself upon his sword i quietly take to the ship there is nothing surprising in this if they but knew it almost all men in their degree some timeor other cherish very nearly the same feelings towardsthe ocean with me there now is your insular city of the manhattoes belted round by wharvesas indian isles by coral reefs commerce surrounds it with her surf right and left the streets take you waterward its extreme downtownis the battery where that noble mole is washed by waves and cooledby breezes which a few hours previous were out of sight of land look at the crowds of water gazers there circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon go fromcorlears hook to coenties slip and from thence by whitehall northward what do you see posted like silent sentinels all around the town stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries some leaning against the spiles some seated upon the pier heads some looking over the bulwarks glasses of ships from china some highaloft in the rigging as if striving to get a still better seaward peep but these are all landsmen of week days pent up in lath and plaster tied to counters nailed to benches clinched to desks how then is this are the green fields gone what do they here but look here come more crowds pacing straight for the water and seemingly bound for a dive strange nothing will contentthem but the extremest limit of the land loitering under the shadylee of yonder warehouses will not suffice no they must getjust as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in and there they stand miles of them leagues inlanders all they come from lanes and alleys streets and avenues north east south and west yet here they all unite tell me does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compassesof all those ships attract them thither once more say you are in the country in some high land of lakes take almost any path you please and ten to one it carries youdown in a dale and leaves you there by a pool in the stream there is magic in it let the most absent minded of men beplunged in his deepest reveries stand that man on his legs set his feet a going and he will infallibly lead you to water if water there be in all that region should you ever be athirstin the great american desert try this experiment if yourcaravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor yes as every one knows meditation and water are wedded for ever but here is an artist he desires to paint you the dreamiest shadiest quietest most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in allthe valley of the saco what is the chief element he employs there stand his trees each with a hollow trunk as if a hermitand a crucifix were within and here sleeps his meadow and theresleep his cattle and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way reaching to overlappingspurs of mountains bathed in their hill side blue but thoughthe picture lies thus tranced and though this pine tree shakes downits sighs like leaves upon this shepherd s head yet all were vain unless the shepherd s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him go visit the prairies in june when for scores on scores of miles youwade knee deep among tiger lilies what is the one charm wanting water there is not a drop of water there were niagara but acataract of sand would you travel your thousand miles to see it why did the poor poet of tennessee upon suddenly receiving two handfulsof silver deliberate whether to buy him a coat which he sadly needed or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach why isalmost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to sea why upon your first voyageas a passenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land why did the old persians hold the sea holy why did the greeksgive it a separate deity and own brother of jove surely all thisis not without meaning and still deeper the meaning of that storyof narcissus who because he could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain plunged into it and was drowned but that same image we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life and this is the keyto it all now when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i beginto grow hazy about the eyes and begin to be over conscious of my lungs i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea as a passenger for to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse and a purse is buta rag unless you have something in it besides passengers get sea sick grow quarrelsome don t sleep of nights do not enjoy themselves much as a general thing no i never go as a passenger nor though i amsomething of a salt do i ever go to sea as a commodore or a captain or a cook i abandon the glory and distinction of such officesto those who like them for my part i abominate all honorablerespectable toils trials and tribulations of every kind whatsoever it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself without takingcare of ships barques brigs schooners and what not and as forgoing as cook though i confess there is considerable glory in that a cook being a sort of officer on ship board yet somehow i neverfancied broiling fowls though once broiled judiciously buttered and judgmatically salted and peppered there is no one who will speak morerespectfully not to say reverentially of a broiled fowl than i will it is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old egyptians upon broiledibis and roasted river horse that you see the mummies of those creaturesin their huge bakehouses the pyramids no when i go to sea i go as a simple sailor right before the mast plumb down into the fore castle aloft there to the royalmast head true they rather order me about some and make mejump from spar to spar like a grasshopper in a may meadow and at first this sort of thing is unpleasant enough it touches one s sense of honor particularly if you comeof an old established family in the land the van rensselaers or randolphs or hardicanutes and more than all if justprevious to putting your hand into the tar pot you have beenlording it as a country schoolmaster making the tallest boysstand in awe of you the transition is a keen one i assure you from a schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoctionof seneca and the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it but even this wears off in time what of it if some old hunks of a sea captain orders me to geta broom and sweep down the decks what does that indignity amount to weighed i mean in the scales of the new testament do you thinkthe archangel gabriel thinks anything the less of me because i promptlyand respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance who ain t a slave tell me that well then however the oldsea captains may order me about however they may thump and punchme about i have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way either in a physical or metaphysical point of view that is and so the universal thump is passed round and all hands should rubeach other s shoulder blades and be content again i always go to sea as a sailor because they makea point of paying me for my trouble whereas they neverpay passengers a single penny that i ever heard of on the contrary passengers themselves must pay and there isall the difference in the world between paying and being paid the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable inflictionthat the two orchard thieves entailed upon us but being paid what will compare with it the urbane activity with which aman receives money is really marvellous considering that weso earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven ah how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition finally i always go to sea as a sailor because of thewholesome exercise and pure air of the fore castle deck for as in this world head winds are far more prevalent than windsfrom astern that is if you never violate the pythagorean maxim so for the most part the commodore on the quarter deck gets hisatmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle he thinks he breathes it first but not so in much the sameway do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things at the same time that the leaders little suspect it but wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smeltthe sea as a merchant sailor i should now take it into myhead to go on a whaling voyage this the invisible policeofficer of the fates who has the constant surveillance of me and secretly dogs me and influences me in some unaccountable way he can better answer than any one else and doubtless my going on this whaling voyage formed part of the grandprogramme of providence that was drawn up a long time ago it came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between moreextensive performances i take it that this part of the billmust have run something like this grand contested election for the presidency of the united states whaling voyage by one ishmael bloody battle in affghanistan though i cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers the fates put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies and short and easy parts in genteel comedies and jolly parts in farces though i cannot tell why this was exactly yet now that i recallall the circumstances i think i can see a little into the springs andmotives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises induced me to set about performing the part i did besides cajoling meinto the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiasedfreewill and discriminating judgment chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the greatwhale himself such a portentous and mysterious monsterroused all my curiosity then the wild and distant seas wherehe rolled his island bulk the undeliverable nameless perilsof the whale these with all the attending marvels of a thousandpatagonian sights and sounds helped to sway me to my wish with other men perhaps such things would not have been inducements but as for me i am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote i love to sail forbidden seas and land on barbarous coasts not ignoring what is good i am quick to perceive a horror and could still be social with it would they let me since it isbut well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the placeone lodges in by reason of these things then the whaling voyage was welcome the great flood gates of the wonder world swung open and in the wildconceits that swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated into myinmost soul endless processions of the whale and mid most of them all one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the air chapter the carpet bagi stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet bag tucked it under my arm and started for cape horn and the pacific quitting the good cityof old manhatto i duly arrived in new bedford it was on a saturdaynight in december much was i disappointed upon learning that the littlepacket for nantucket had already sailed and that no way of reachingthat place would offer till the following monday as most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whalingstop at this same new bedford thence to embark on their voyage it may as well be related that i for one had no idea of so doing for my mind was made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft because there was a fine boisterous something about everythingconnected with that famous old island which amazingly pleased me besides though new bedford has of late been gradually monopolizingthe business of whaling and though in this matter poor old nantucketis now much behind her yet nantucket was her great original the tyre of this carthage the place where the first deadamerican whale was stranded where else but from nantucket didthose aboriginal whalemen the red men first sally out in canoesto give chase to the leviathan and where but from nantucket too did that first adventurous little sloop put forth partly laden with imported cobblestones so goes the story to throw at the whales in order to discover when they were nighenough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit now having a night a day and still another night following before mein new bedford ere i could embark for my destined port it becamea matter of concernment where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile it was a very dubious looking nay a very dark and dismal night bitingly cold and cheerless i knew no one in the place with anxious grapnels i had sounded my pocket and only brought up a fewpieces of silver so wherever you go ishmael said i to myself as i stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towardsthe south wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodgefor the night my dear ishmael be sure to inquire the price and don t be too particular with halting steps i paced the streets and passed the sign of the crossed harpoons but it looked too expensive and jolly there further on from the bright red windows of the sword fish inn there came such fervent rays that it seemed to have meltedthe packed snow and ice from before the house for everywhereelse the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard asphaltic pavement rather weary for me when i struckmy foot against the flinty projections because from hard remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a mostmiserable plight too expensive and jolly again thought i pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within but go on ishmael said i at last don t you hear get awayfrom before the door your patched boots are stopping the way so on i went i now by instinct followed the streets thattook me waterward for there doubtless were the cheapest if not the cheeriest inns such dreary streets blocks of blackness not houses on either hand and here and there a candle like a candle moving about in a tomb at this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter of the town proved all but deserted but presentlyi came to a smoky light proceeding from a low wide building the door of which stood invitingly open it had a careless look as if it were meant for the uses of the public so entering the first thing i did was to stumble over an ash box in the porch ha thought i ha as the flying particles almost choked me are theseashes from that destroyed city gomorrah but the crossed harpoons and the the sword fish this then must needs be the signof the trap however i picked myself up and hearing a loudvoice within pushed on and opened a second interior door it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet a hundredblack faces turned round in their rows to peer and beyond a black angel of doom was beating a book in a pulpit it was a negro church and the preacher s text was aboutthe blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing andteeth gnashing there ha ishmael muttered i backing out wretched entertainment at the sign of the trap moving on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far fromthe docks and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray and these words underneath the spouter inn peter coffin coffin spouter rather ominous in that particular connexion thought i but it is a common name in nantucket they say and isuppose this peter here is an emigrant from there as the lightlooked so dim and the place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if itmight have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district and as the swinging sign had a poverty stricken sort of creakto it i thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings and the best of pea coffee it was a queer sort of place a gable ended old house one sidepalsied as it were and leaning over sadly it stood on a sharpbleak corner where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept upa worse howling than ever it did about poor paul s tossed craft euroclydon nevertheless is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any onein doors with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed in judging of that tempestuous wind called euroclydon says an old writer of whose works i possess the only copyextant it maketh a marvellous difference whether thou lookestout at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside or whether thou observest it from that sashless window where the frost is on both sides and of which the wight deathis the only glazier true enough thought i as this passageoccurred to my mind old black letter thou reasonest well yes these eyes are windows and this body of mine is the house what a pity they didn t stop up the chinks and the crannies though and thrust in a little lint here and there but it s too lateto make any improvements now the universe is finished the copestone is on and the chips were carted off a millionyears ago poor lazarus there chattering his teeth againstthe curbstone for his pillow and shaking off his tatterswith his shiverings he might plug up both ears with rags and put a corn cob into his mouth and yet that would not keepout the tempestuous euroclydon euroclydon says old dives in his red silken wrapper he had a redder one afterwards pooh pooh what a fine frosty night how orion glitters what northern lights let them talk of their oriental summerclimes of everlasting conservatories give me the privilegeof making my own summer with my own coals but what thinks lazarus can he warm his blue hands by holding them upto the grand northern lights would not lazarus rather be in sumatrathan here would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise alongthe line of the equator yea ye gods go down to the fiery pit itself in order to keep out this frost now that lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone beforethe door of dives this is more wonderful than that an icebergshould be moored to one of the moluccas yet dives himself he too lives like a czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs and being a president of a temperance society he only drinksthe tepid tears of orphans but no more of this blubbering now we are going a whaling and there isplenty of that yet to come let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet and see what sort of a place this spouter may be chapter the spouter innentering that gable ended spouter inn you found yourselfin a wide low straggling entry with old fashioned wainscots reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft on one side hung a very large oil painting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the unequal crosslights by whichyou viewed it it was only by diligent study and a series ofsystematic visits to it and careful inquiry of the neighbors that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows that atfirst you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the new england hags had endeavored to delineatechaos bewitched but by dint of much and earnest contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and especially by throwing openthe little window towards the back of the entry you at lastcome to the conclusion that such an idea however wild might not be altogether unwarranted but what most puzzled and confounded you was a long limber portentous black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture overthree blue dim perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast a boggy soggy squitchy picture truly enough to drivea nervous man distracted yet was there a sort of indefinite half attained unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly frozeyou to it till you involuntarily took an oath with yourselfto find out what that marvellous painting meant ever and anona bright but alas deceptive idea would dart you through it s the black sea in a midnight gale it s the unnaturalcombat of the four primal elements it s a blasted heath it s a hyperborean winter scene it s the breaking up ofthe icebound stream of time but at last all these fanciesyielded to that one portentous something in the picture s midst that once found out and all the rest were plain but stop does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish eventhe great leviathan himself in fact the artist s design seemed this a final theory of my own partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged personswith whom i conversed upon the subject the picture representsa cape horner in a great hurricane the half foundered shipweltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to spring clean over the craft is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast heads the opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish arrayof monstrous clubs and spears some were thickly set with glitteringteeth resembling ivory saws others were tufted with knots of human hair and one was sickle shaped with a vast handle sweeping roundlike the segment made in the new mown grass by a long armed mower you shuddered as you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibaland savage could ever have gone a death harvesting with such a hacking horrifying implement mixed with these were rusty old whaling lancesand harpoons all broken and deformed some were storied weapons with this once long lance now wildly elbowed fifty years ago didnathan swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset and that harpoon so like a corkscrew now was flung in javan seas and run away with by a whale years afterwards slain off the capeof blanco the original iron entered nigh the tail and like a restlessneedle sojourning in the body of a man travelled full forty feet and at last was found imbedded in the hump crossing this dusky entry and on through yon low arched way cut through what in old times must have been a great centralchimney with fireplaces all round you enter the public room a still duskier place is this with such low ponderousbeams above and such old wrinkled planks beneath that youwould almost fancy you trod some old craft s cockpits especially of such a howling night when this corner anchoredold ark rocked so furiously on one side stood a long low shelf like table covered with cracked glass cases filled withdusty rarities gathered from this wide world s remotest nooks projecting from the further angle of the room stands adark looking den the bar a rude attempt at a right whale s head be that how it may there stands the vast arched bone of thewhale s jaw so wide a coach might almost drive beneath it within are shabby shelves ranged round with old decanters bottles flasks and in those jaws of swift destruction like another cursed jonah by which name indeed they calledhim bustles a little withered old man who for their money dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison though true cylinders without within the villanous green gogglingglasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass surroundthese footpads goblets fill to this mark and your charge isbut a penny to this a penny more and so on to the full glass the cape horn measure which you may gulp down for a shilling upon entering the place i found a number of young seamen gathered abouta table examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander i sought the landlord and telling him i desired to be accommodatedwith a room received for answer that his house was full not a bed unoccupied but avast he added tapping his forehead you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer s blanket have ye i s pose you are goin a whalin so you d better get used to thatsort of thing i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed that if ishould ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable why ratherthan wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night i would put up with the half of any decent man s blanket i thought so all right take a seat supper you want supper supper ll be ready directly i sat down on an old wooden settle carved all over like abench on the battery at one end a ruminating tar was stillfurther adorning it with his jack knife stooping overand diligently working away at the space between his legs he was trying his hand at a ship under full sail but he didn tmake much headway i thought at last some four or five of us were summoned to ourmeal in an adjoining room it was cold as iceland no fire at all the landlord said he couldn t afford it nothing but two dismal tallow candles each in a winding sheet we were fain to button up our monkey jackets and hold to ourlips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers but the fare was of the most substantial kind not only meatand potatoes but dumplings good heavens dumplings for supper one young fellow in a green box coat addressed himselfto these dumplings in a most direful manner my boy said the landlord you ll have the nightmareto a dead sartainty landlord i whispered that aint the harpooneer is it oh no said he looking a sort of diabolically funny the harpooneeris a dark complexioned chap he never eats dumplings he don t he eats nothing but steaks and he likes em rare the devil he does says i where is that harpooneer is he here he ll be here afore long was the answer i could not help it but i began to feel suspicious of this dark complexioned harpooneer at any rate i made up mymind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together he must undress and get into bed before i did supper over the company went back to the bar room when knowing not what else to do with myself i resolved to spendthe rest of the evening as a looker on presently a rioting noise was heard without starting up the landlord cried that s the grampus s crew i seed her reportedin the offing this morning a three years voyage and a full ship hurrah boys now we ll have the latest news from the feegees a tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry the door was flung open and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough enveloped in their shaggywatch coats and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters all bedarned and ragged and their beards stiff with icicles they seemed an eruption of bears from labrador they had justlanded from their boat and this was the first house they entered no wonder then that they made a straight wake for the whale s mouth the bar when the wrinkled little old jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all round one complained of a badcold in his head upon which jonah mixed him a pitch like potionof gin and molasses which he swore was a sovereign cure for allcolds and catarrhs whatsoever never mind of how long standing or whether caught off the coast of labrador or on the weather sideof an ice island the liquor soon mounted into their heads as it generallydoes even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea and they began capering about most obstreperously i observed however that one of them held somewhat aloof and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of hisshipmates by his own sober face yet upon the whole he refrained frommaking as much noise as the rest this man interested me at once and since the sea gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though but a sleeping partner one so far as this narrative isconcerned i will here venture upon a little description of him he stood full six feet in height with noble shoulders and a chestlike a coffer dam i have seldom seen such brawn in a man his face was deeply brown and burnt making his white teethdazzling by the contrast while in the deep shadows of his eyesfloated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy his voice at once announced that he was a southerner and from hisfine stature i thought he must be one of those tall mountaineersfrom the alleghanian ridge in virginia when the revelry of hiscompanions had mounted to its height this man slipped away unobserved and i saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea in a few minutes however he was missed by his shipmates and being it seems for some reason a huge favorite with them they raised a cry of bulkington bulkington where s bulkington and darted out of the house in pursuit of him it was now about nine o clock and the room seeming almostsupernaturally quiet after these orgies i began to congratulatemyself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previousto the entrance of the seamen no man prefers to sleep two in a bed in fact you woulda good deal rather not sleep with your own brother i don t knowhow it is but people like to be private when they are sleeping and when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange town and that strangera harpooneer then your objections indefinitely multiply nor was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor should sleeptwo in a bed more than anybody else for sailors no moresleep two in a bed at sea than bachelor kings do ashore to be sure they all sleep together in one apartment but youhave your own hammock and cover yourself with your own blanket and sleep in your own skin the more i pondered over this harpooneer the more i abominatedthe thought of sleeping with him it was fair to presume thatbeing a harpooneer his linen or woollen as the case might be would not be of the tidiest certainly none of the finest i began to twitch all over besides it was getting late and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards suppose now he should tumble in upon me at midnight how could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming landlord i ve changed my mind about that harpooneer i shan t sleep with him i ll try the bench here just as you please i m sorry i cant spare ye a tablecloth fora mattress and it s a plaguy rough board here feeling of the knotsand notches but wait a bit skrimshander i ve got a carpenter splane there in the bar wait i say and i ll make ye snug enough so saying he procured the plane and with his old silk handkerchieffirst dusting the bench vigorously set to planing away at my bed the while grinning like an ape the shavings flew right and left till at last the plane iron came bump against an indestructible knot the landlord was near spraining his wrist and i told him for heaven ssake to quit the bed was soft enough to suit me and i did not knowhow all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank so gathering up the shavings with another grin and throwing them intothe great stove in the middle of the room he went about his business and left me in a brown study i now took the measure of the bench and found that it wasa foot too short but that could be mended with a chair but it was a foot too narrow and the other bench inthe room was about four inches higher than the planed one so there was no yoking them i then placed the first benchlengthwise along the only clear space against the wall leaving a little interval between for my back to settle down in but i soon found that there came such a draught of cold airover me from under the sill of the window that this plan wouldnever do at all especially as another current from the ricketydoor met the one from the window and both together formeda series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spotwhere i had thought to spend the night the devil fetch that harpooneer thought i but stop couldn t i steal a march on him bolt his door inside and jumpinto his bed not to be wakened by the most violent knockings it seemed no bad idea but upon second thoughts i dismissed it for who could tell but what the next morning so soon as i poppedout of the room the harpooneer might be standing in the entry all ready to knock me down still looking around me again and seeing no possible chanceof spending a sufferable night unless in some other person s bed i began to think that after all i might be cherishingunwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer thinks i i ll wait awhile he must be dropping in before long i ll have a good look at him then and perhaps we may becomejolly good bedfellows after all there s no telling but though the other boarders kept coming in by ones twos and threes and going to bed yet no sign of my harpooneer landlord said i what sort of a chap is he does he alwayskeep such late hours it was now hard upon twelve o clock the landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle and seemedto be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension no he answered generally he s an early bird airley to bedand airley to rise yea he s the bird what catches the worm but to night he went out a peddling you see and i don t seewhat on airth keeps him so late unless may be he can tsell his head can t sell his head what sort of a bamboozingly storyis this you are telling me getting into a towering rage do you pretend to say landlord that this harpooneer is actuallyengaged this blessed saturday night or rather sunday morning in peddling his head around this town that s precisely it said the landlord and i told him he couldn tsell it here the market s overstocked with what shouted i with heads to be sure ain t there too many heads in the world i tell you what it is landlord said i quite calmly you d better stop spinning that yarn to me i m not green may be not taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick but i rayther guess you ll be done brown if that ere harpooneerhears you a slanderin his head i ll break it for him said i now flying into a passion againat this unaccountable farrago of the landlord s it s broke a ready said he broke said i broke do you mean sartain and that s the very reason he can t sell it i guess landlord said i going up to him as cool as mt hecla in asnowstorm landlord stop whittling you and i must understandone another and that too without delay i come to your houseand want a bed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer and about this harpooneer whom i have not yet seen you persistin telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tendingto beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom youdesign for my bedfellow a sort of connexion landlord which isan intimate and confidential one in the highest degree i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what thisharpooneer is and whether i shall be in all respects safeto spend the night with him and in the first place you willbe so good as to unsay that story about selling his head which if true i take to be good evidence that this harpooneeris stark mad and i ve no idea of sleeping with a madman and you sir you i mean landlord you sir by trying to induceme to do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liableto a criminal prosecution wall said the landlord fetching a long breath that s apurty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then but be easy be easy this here harpooneer i have been tellin you of has just arrived from the south seas where he bought upa lot of balmed new zealand heads great curios you know and he s sold all on em but one and that one he s trying to sellto night cause to morrow s sunday and it would not do to be sellin human heads about the streets when folks is goin to churches he wanted to last sunday but i stopped him just as he was goin out of the door with four heads strung on a string for allthe airth like a string of inions this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed that the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling me but at the same time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayedout of a saturday night clean into the holy sabbath engaged in sucha cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators depend upon it landlord that harpooneer is a dangerous man he pays reg lar was the rejoinder but come it s gettingdreadful late you had better be turning flukes it s a nice bed sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced there s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed it s an almighty big bed that why afore we give it up sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the foot of it but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night and somehow sam got pitched on the floor and came near breaking his arm after that sal said it wouldn t do come along here i ll give ye a glim in a jiffy and so saying he lighteda candle and held it towards me offering to lead the way but i stood irresolute when looking at a clock in the corner he exclaimed i vum it s sunday you won t see that harpooneer to night he s come to anchor somewhere come along then do come won t ye come i considered the matter a moment and then up stairs we went and i was ushered into a small room cold as a clam and furnished sure enough with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeedfor any four harpooneers to sleep abreast there said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy oldsea chest that did double duty as a wash stand and centre table there make yourself comfortable now and good night to ye i turned round from eyeing the bed but he had disappeared folding back the counterpane i stooped over the bed though none of the most elegant it yet stood the scrutinytolerably well i then glanced round the room and besidesthe bedstead and centre table could see no other furniturebelonging to the place but a rude shelf the four walls and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale of things not properly belonging to the room there was ahammock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in one corner also a large seaman s bag containing the harpooneer s wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk likewise there was a parcelof outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire place and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed but what is this on the chest i took it up and held it closeto the light and felt it and smelt it and tried every waypossible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it i can compare it to nothing but a large door mat ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags somethinglike the stained porcupine quills round an indian moccasin there was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat as you seethe same in south american ponchos but could it be possiblethat any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat and paradethe streets of any christian town in that sort of guise i put it on to try it and it weighed me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggy and thick and i thought a little damp as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing itof a rainy day i went up in it to a bit of glass stuckagainst the wall and i never saw such a sight in my life i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myselfa kink in the neck i sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinkingabout this head peddling harpooneer and his door mat after thinking some time on the bed side i got up and took off mymonkey jacket and then stood in the middle of the room thinking i then took off my coat and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves but beginning to feel very cold now half undressed as i was and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer snot coming home at all that night it being so very late i made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commendedmyself to the care of heaven whether that mattress was stuffed with corncobs or broken crockery there is no telling but i rolled about a good deal and couldnot sleep for a long time at last i slid off into a light doze and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod when i heard a heavy footfall in the passage and saw a glimmerof light come into the room from under the door lord save me thinks i that must be the harpooneer the infernal head peddler but i lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a word till spoken to holding a lightin one hand and that identical new zealand head in the other the stranger entered the room and without looking towardsthe bed placed his candle a good way off from me on the floorin one corner and then began working away at the knotted cordsof the large bag i before spoke of as being in the room i was all eagerness to see his face but he kept it avertedfor some time while employed in unlacing the bag s mouth this accomplished however he turned round when good heavens what a sight such a face it was of a dark purplish yellow color here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares yes it s just as i thought he s a terrible bedfellow he s been in a fight got dreadfully cut and here he is just from the surgeon but at that moment he chanced to turnhis face so towards the light that i plainly saw they could notbe sticking plasters at all those black squares on his cheeks they were stains of some sort or other at first i knew not whatto make of this but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me i remembered a story of a white man a whaleman too who falling among the cannibals had been tattooed by them i concluded that this harpooneer in the course of hisdistant voyages must have met with a similar adventure and what is it thought i after all it s only his outside a man can be honest in any sort of skin but then what to make ofhis unearthly complexion that part of it i mean lying round about and completely independent of the squares of tattooing to be sure it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning but i never heard of a hot sun s tanning a white man into apurplish yellow one however i had never been in the south seas and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effectsupon the skin now while all these ideas were passingthrough me like lightning this harpooneer never noticed meat all but after some difficulty having opened his bag he commenced fumbling in it and presently pulled out a sortof tomahawk and a seal skin wallet with the hair on placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room he then took the new zealand head a ghastly thing enough and crammed it down into the bag he now took off his hat a new beaver hat when i came nigh singing out with fresh surprise there was no hair on his head none to speak of at least nothing but a small scalp knot twisted up on his forehead his baldpurplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull had not the stranger stood between me and the door i wouldhave bolted out of it quicker than ever i bolted a dinner even as it was i thought something of slipping out ofthe window but it was the second floor back i am no coward but what to make of this headpeddling purple rascal altogetherpassed my comprehension ignorance is the parent of fear and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger i confess i was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devilhimself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night in fact i was so afraid of him that i was not game enoughjust then to address him and demand a satisfactory answerconcerning what seemed inexplicable in him meanwhile he continued the business of undressing and atlast showed his chest and arms as i live these coveredparts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face his back too was all over the same dark squares he seemed to have been in a thirty years war and justescaped from it with a sticking plaster shirt still more his very legs were marked as if a parcel of darkgreen frogs were running up the trunks of young palms it was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savageor other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the south seas and so landed in this christian country i quaked to think of it a peddler of heads too perhaps the heads of his own brothers he might take a fancy to mine heavens look at that tomahawk but there was no time for shuddering for now the savage wentabout something that completely fascinated my attention and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen going to his heavy grego or wrapall or dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair he fumbled in the pockets and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunchon its back and exactly the color of a three days old congo baby remembering the embalmed head at first i almost thought that thisblack manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner but seeing that it was not at all limber and that it glisteneda good deal like polished ebony i concluded that it mustbe nothing but a wooden idol which indeed it proved to be for now the savage goes up to the empty fire place and removing the papered fire board sets up this littlehunch backed image like a tenpin between the andirons the chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty so that i thought this fire place made a very appropriate littleshrine or chapel for his congo idol i now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image feeling but ill at ease meantime to see what was next to follow first he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket and places them carefully before the idol then laying a bit of shipbiscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp he kindledthe shavings into a sacrificial blaze presently after many hastysnatches into the fire and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly he at last succeededin drawing out the biscuit then blowing off the heat and ashesa little he made a polite offer of it to the little negro but the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all he never moved his lips all these strange antics were accompaniedby still stranger guttural noises from the devotee who seemed to bepraying in a sing song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner at last extinguishing the fire he took the idol up very unceremoniously and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he werea sportsman bagging a dead woodcock all these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concludinghis business operations and jumping into bed with me i thoughtit was high time now or never before the light was put out to break the spell in which i had so long been bound but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say was a fatal one taking up his tomahawk from the table he examined the head of itfor an instant and then holding it to the light with his mouthat the handle he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke the next moment the light was extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between his teeth sprang into bed with me i sang out i could not help it now and giving a sudden grunt of astonishmenthe began feeling me stammering out something i knew not what i rolled away from himagainst the wall and then conjured him whoever or whatever he might be to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again but his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but illcomprehended my meaning who e debel you he at last said you no speak e dam me i kill e and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark landlord for god s sake peter coffin shoutedi landlord watch coffin angels save me speak e tell ee me who ee be or dam me i kill e again growledthe cannibal while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scatteredthe hot tobacco ashes about me till i thought my linen would get on fire but thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the room lightin hand and leaping from the bed i ran up to him don t be afraid now said he grinning again queequeg here wouldn tharm a hair of your head stop your grinning shouted i and why didn t you tell methat that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal i thought ye know d it didn t i tell ye he was a peddlin heads around town but turn flukes again and go to sleep queequeg look here you sabbee me i sabbee you this mansleepe you you sabbee me sabbee plenty grunted queequeg puffing away at his pipeand sitting up in bed you gettee in he added motioning to me with his tomahawk and throwing the clothes to one side he really did thisin not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way i stood looking at him a moment for all his tattooingshe was on the whole a clean comely looking cannibal what s all this fuss i have been making about thought ito myself the man s a human being just as i am he has justas much reason to fear me as i have to be afraid of him better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian landlord said i tell him to stash his tomahawk there or pipe or whatever you call it tell him to stop smoking in short and i willturn in with him but i don t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me it s dangerous besides i ain t insured this being told to queequeg he at once complied and again politelymotioned me to get into bed rolling over to one side as much as to say i won t touch a leg of ye good night landlord said i you may go i turned in and never slept better in my life chapter the counterpaneupon waking next morning about daylight i found queequeg s armthrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner you had almost thought i had been his wife the counterpane wasof patchwork full of odd little parti colored squares and triangles and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable cretanlabyrinth of a figure no two parts of which were of one precise shade owing i suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sunand shade his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times this same arm of his i say looked for all the world like a stripof that same patchwork quilt indeed partly lying on it as the armdid when i first awoke i could hardly tell it from the quilt they so blended their hues together and it was only by the senseof weight and pressure that i could tell that queequeg was hugging me my sensations were strange let me try to explain them when i wasa child i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me whether it was a reality or a dream i never could entirely settle the circumstance was this i had been cutting up some caper or other i think it was trying to crawl up the chimney as i had seen a littlesweep do a few days previous and my stepmother who somehow or other was all the time whipping me or sending me to bed supperless my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me offto bed though it was only two o clock in the afternoon of the st june the longest day in the year in our hemisphere i felt dreadfully but there was no help for it so up stairs i went to my little roomin the third floor undressed myself as slowly as possible so as tokill time and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hoursmust elapse before i could hope for a resurrection sixteen hours in bed the small of my back ached to think of it and it was so light too the sun shining in at the window and a great rattling of coaches in the streets and the soundof gay voices all over the house i felt worse and worse at last i got up dressed and softly going down in mystockinged feet sought out my stepmother and suddenly threwmyself at her feet beseeching her as a particular favor to giveme a good slippering for my misbehaviour anything indeed butcondemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time but she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers and back i had to go to my room for several hours i laythere broad awake feeling a great deal worse than i have everdone since even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes at last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze and slowly waking from it half steeped in dreams i opened my eyes and the before sunlit room was now wrapped in outer darkness instantly i felt a shock running through all my frame nothing was to be seen and nothing was to be heard but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine my arm hungover the counterpane and the nameless unimaginable silent formor phantom to which the hand belonged seemed closelyseated by my bed side for what seemed ages piled on ages i lay there frozen with the most awful fears not daringto drag away my hand yet ever thinking that if i could butstir it one single inch the horrid spell would be broken i knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me but waking in the morning i shudderingly remembered it all and for days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myselfin confounding attempts to explain the mystery nay to thisvery hour i often puzzle myself with it now take away the awful fear and my sensations atfeeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangeness to those which i experienced on wakingup and seeing queequeg s pagan arm thrown round me but at length all the past night s events soberly recurred one by one in fixed reality and then i lay only alive tothe comical predicament for though i tried to move his arm unlock his bridegroom clasp yet sleeping as he was he stillhugged me tightly as though naught but death should part us twain i now strove to rouse him queequeg but his only answerwas a snore i then rolled over my neck feeling as if itwere in a horse collar and suddenly felt a slight scratch throwing aside the counterpane there lay the tomahawk sleepingby the savage s side as if it were a hatchet faced baby a pretty pickle truly thought i abed here in a strangehouse in the broad day with a cannibal and a tomahawk queequeg in the name of goodness queequeg wake at length by dint of much wriggling and loud and incessant expostulationsupon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in thatmatrimonial sort of style i succeeded in extracting a grunt and presently he drew back his arm shook himself all overlike a newfoundland dog just from the water and sat up in bed stiff as a pike staff looking at me and rubbing his eyesas if he did not altogether remember how i came to be there though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemedslowly dawning over him meanwhile i lay quietly eyeing him having no serious misgivings now and bent upon narrowly observingso curious a creature when at last his mind seemed madeup touching the character of his bedfellow and he became as it were reconciled to the fact he jumped out upon the floor and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that if it pleased me he would dress first and then leave meto dress afterwards leaving the whole apartment to myself thinks i queequeg under the circumstances this is a verycivilized overture but the truth is these savages have aninnate sense of delicacy say what you will it is marvelloushow essentially polite they are i pay this particularcompliment to queequeg because he treated me with so muchcivility and consideration while i was guilty of great rudeness staring at him from the bed and watching all his toilette motions for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding nevertheless a man like queequeg you don t see every day he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat a very tall one by the by and then still minus his trowsers he hunted up his boots what under the heavens he did it for i cannot tell but his next movement was to crush himself boots in hand and hat on under the bed when from sundryviolent gaspings and strainings i inferred he was hard at workbooting himself though by no law of propriety that i ever heard of is any man required to be private when putting on his boots but queequeg do you see was a creature in the transition state neither caterpillar nor butterfly he was just enough civilizedto show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manner his education was not yet completed he was an undergraduate if he had not been a small degree civilized he very probablywould not have troubled himself with boots at all but then if he had not been still a savage he never would have dreamtof getting under the bed to put them on at last he emergedwith his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes and began creaking and limping about the room as if not beingmuch accustomed to boots his pair of damp wrinkled cowhide ones probably not made to order either rather pinched and tormentedhim at the first go off of a bitter cold morning seeing now that there were no curtains to the window and thatthe street being very narrow the house opposite commanded a plain viewinto the room and observing more and more the indecorous figure thatqueequeg made staving about with little else but his hat and boots on i begged him as well as i could to accelerate his toilet somewhat and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible he complied and then proceeded to wash himself at that time inthe morning any christian would have washed his face but queequeg to my amazement contented himself with restricting his ablutionsto his chest arms and hands he then donned his waistcoat and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash stand centre table dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face i was watching to see where he kept his razor when lo and behold he takes the harpoon from the bed corner slips out the longwooden stock unsheathes the head whets it a little on his boot and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall begins a vigorous scraping or rather harpooning of his cheeks thinks i queequeg this is using rogers s best cutlery with a vengeance afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to knowof what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and how exceedinglysharp the long straight edges are always kept the rest of his toilet was soon achieved and he proudly marchedout of the room wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket and sporting his harpoon like a marshal s baton chapter breakfasti quickly followed suit and descending into the bar room accostedthe grinning landlord very pleasantly i cherished no malicetowards him though he had been skylarking with me not a littlein the matter of my bedfellow however a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather tooscarce a good thing the more s the pity so if any one man in his own proper person afford stuff for a good joketo anybody let him not be backward but let him cheerfullyallow himself to spend and to be spent in that way and the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for the bar room was now full of the boarders who had been droppingin the night previous and whom i had not as yet had a good look at they were nearly all whalemen chief mates and second mates and third mates and sea carpenters and sea coopers and sea blacksmiths and harpooneers and ship keepers a brown and brawny company with bosky beards an unshorn shaggy set all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore this young fellow s healthy cheek is like a sun toastedpear in hue and would seem to smell almost as musky he cannot have been three days landed from his indian voyage that man next him looks a few shades lighter you might saya touch of satin wood is in him in the complexion of a thirdstill lingers a tropic tawn but slightly bleached withal he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore but who couldshow a cheek like queequeg which barred with various tints seemed like the andes western slope to show forth in one array contrasting climates zone by zone grub ho now cried the landlord flinging open a door and in we went to breakfast they say that men who have seen the world thereby becomequite at ease in manner quite self possessed in company not always though ledyard the great new england traveller and mungo park the scotch one of all men they possessedthe least assurance in the parlor but perhaps the merecrossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as ledyard did or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach in the negroheart of africa which was the sum of poor mungo s performances this kind of travel i say may not be the very best modeof attaining a high social polish still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had anywhere these reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstancethat after we were all seated at the table and i was preparingto hear some good stories about whaling to my no smallsurprise nearly every man maintained a profound silence and not only that but they looked embarrassed yes here werea set of sea dogs many of whom without the slightest bashfulnesshad boarded great whales on the high seas entire strangers to them and duelled them dead without winking and yet here theysat at a social breakfast table all of the same calling all of kindred tastes looking round as sheepishly at each otheras though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfoldamong the green mountains a curious sight these bashful bears these timid warrior whalemen but as for queequeg why queequeg sat there among them at the head of the table too it so chanced as cool as an icicle to be sure i cannot say much for his breeding his greatestadmirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpooninto breakfast with him and using it there without ceremony reaching over the table with it to the imminent jeopardyof many heads and grappling the beefsteaks towards him but that was certainly very coolly done by him and every oneknows that in most people s estimation to do anything coollyis to do it genteelly we will not speak of all queequeg s peculiarities here how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls and applied his undividedattention to beefsteaks done rare enough that when breakfastwas over he withdrew like the rest into the public room lighted his tomahawk pipe and was sitting there quietlydigesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on when isallied out for a stroll chapter the streetif i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandishan individual as queequeg circulating among the polite societyof a civilized town that astonishment soon departed upon takingmy first daylight stroll through the streets of new bedford in thoroughfares nigh the docks any considerable seaport will frequentlyoffer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts even in broadway and chestnut streets mediterranean mariners willsometimes jostle the affrighted ladies regent street is not unknownto lascars and malays and at bombay in the apollo green live yankeeshave often scared the natives but new bedford beats all water streetand wapping in these last mentioned haunts you see only sailors but in new bedford actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners savages outright many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh it makes a stranger stare but besides the feegeeans tongatobooarrs erromanggoans pannangians and brighggians and besides the wild specimens of the whaling craftwhich unheeded reel about the streets you will see other sights stillmore curious certainly more comical there weekly arrive in this townscores of green vermonters and new hampshire men all athirst for gainand glory in the fishery they are mostly young of stalwart frames fellows who have felled forests and now seek to drop the axe and snatchthe whale lance many are as green as the green mountains whencethey came in some things you would think them but a few hours old look there that chap strutting round the corner he wears a beaver hatand swallow tailed coat girdled with a sailor belt and a sheath knife here comes another with a sou wester and a bombazine cloak no town bred dandy will compare with a country bred one i meana downright bumpkin dandy a fellow that in the dog days will mowhis two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to makea distinguished reputation and joins the great whale fishery youshould see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport in bespeaking his sea outfit he orders bell buttons to his waistcoats straps to his canvas trowsers ah poor hay seed how bitterlywill burst those straps in the first howling gale when thouart driven straps buttons and all down the throat of the tempest but think not that this famous town has only harpooneers cannibals and bumpkins to show her visitors not at all still new bedford is a queer place had it not been for us whalemen that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howlingcondition as the coast of labrador as it is parts of herback country are enough to frighten one they look so bony the town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in in all new england it is a land of oil true enough but not like canaan a land also of corn and wine the streets do not run with milk nor in the spring timedo they pave them with fresh eggs yet in spite of this nowhere in all america will you find more patrician like houses parks and gardens more opulent than in new bedford whence camethey how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder loftymansion and your question will be answered yes all these brave housesand flowery gardens came from the atlantic pacific and indian oceans one and all they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottomof the sea can herr alexander perform a feat like that in new bedford fathers they say give whales for dowers to theirdaughters and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a piece you must go to new bedford to see a brilliant wedding for they say they have reservoirs of oil in every house and every night recklesslyburn their lengths in spermaceti candles in summer time the town is sweet to see full of fine maples long avenues of green and gold and in august high in air the beautiful and bountiful horse chestnuts candelabra wise profferthe passer by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms so omnipotent is art which in many a district of new bedford hassuperinduced bright terraces

their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens elsewhere match that bloom of theirs ye cannot save in salem where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk their sailorsweethearts smell them miles off shore as though they were drawingnigh the odorous moluccas instead of the puritanic sands chapter the chapelin this same new bedford there stands a whaleman s chapel and few are the moody fishermen shortly bound for the indian oceanor pacific who fail to make a sunday visit to the spot i am sure that i did not returning from my first morning stroll i again sallied outupon this special errand the sky had changed from clear sunny cold to driving sleet and mist wrapping myself in myshaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin i fought my wayagainst the stubborn storm entering i found a small scatteredcongregation of sailors and sailors wives and widows a muffledsilence reigned only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable the chaplain had not yet arrived and there these silent islandsof men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets with black borders masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit three of them ran something like the following but i do notpretend to quote sacredto the memoryofjohn talbot who at the age of eighteen was lost overboardnear the isle of desolation off patagonia november st this tabletis erected to his memoryby his sister sacredto the memoryofrobert long willis ellery nathan

scene there wasa wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance this savage was the only person present who seemed to noticemy entrance because he was the only one who could not read and therefore was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose namesappeared there were now among the congregation i knew not but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery and so plainly did several women present wear the countenanceif not the trappings of some unceasing grief that i feel surethat here before me were assembled those in whose unhealinghearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically causedthe old wounds to bleed afresh oh ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass who standing among flowers can say here here lies my beloved ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these what bitter blanks in those black bordered marbles which coverno ashes what despair in those immovable inscriptions what deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the linesthat seem to gnaw upon all faith and refuse resurrectionsto the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave as well might those tablets stand in the cave of elephanta as here in what census of living creatures the dead of mankind are included why it is that a universal proverb says of them that they tell no tales though containing more secrets than the goodwin sands how it isthat to his name who yesterday departed for the other world we prefixso significant and infidel a word and yet do not thus entitle him if he but embarks for the remotest indies of this living earth why the life insurance companies pay death forfeitures upon immortals in what eternal unstirring paralysis and deadly hopeless trance yet lies

hush all the dead wherefore butthe rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city all these things are not without their meanings but faith like a jackal feeds among the tombs and even fromthese dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope it needs scarcely to be told with what feelings on the eveof a nantucket voyage i regarded those marble tablets and by the murky light of that darkened doleful day readthe fate of the whalemen who had gone before me yes ishmael the same fate may be thine but somehow i grew merry again delightful inducements to embark fine chance for promotion it seems aye a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet yes there is death in this business of whaling a speechlesslyquick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity but what then methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of lifeand death methinks that what they call my shadow here on earthis my true substance methinks that in looking at things spiritual we are too much like oysters observing the sun throughthe water and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air methinks my body is but the lees of my better being in fact take my body who will take it i say it is not me and therefore three cheers for nantucket and come a stoveboat and stove body when they will for stave my soul jove himself cannot chapter the pulpiti had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerablerobustness entered immediately as the storm pelted door flewback upon admitting him a quick regardful eyeing of him by allthe congregation sufficiently attested that this fine oldman was the chaplain yes it was the famous father mapple so called by the whalemen among whom he was a very great favorite he had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth but formany years past had dedicated his life to the ministry at the time i now write of father mapple was in the hardy winterof a healthy old age that sort of old age which seems merging intoa second flowering youth for among all the fissures of his wrinkles there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath february s snow no one having previously heard his history could for the first timebehold father mapple without the utmost interest because therewere certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led when he entered i observed that he carried no umbrella and certainly had not come in his carriage for his tarpaulinhat ran down with melting sleet and his great pilot clothjacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weightof the water it had absorbed however hat and coat andovershoes were one by one removed and hung up in a littlespace in an adjacent corner when arrayed in a decent suit he quietly approached the pulpit like most old fashioned pulpits it was a very lofty one and sincea regular stairs to such a height would by its long angle withthe floor seriously contract the already small area of the chapel the architect it seemed had acted upon the hint of father mapple and finished the pulpit without a stairs substituting a perpendicularside ladder like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea the wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsomepair of red worsted man ropes for this ladder which being itselfnicely headed and stained with a mahogany color the whole contrivance considering what manner of chapel it was seemed by no meansin bad taste halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man ropes father mapple cast a look upwards and then with a truly sailor likebut still reverential dexterity hand over hand mounted the stepsas if ascending the main top of his vessel the perpendicular parts of this side ladder as is usually the casewith swinging ones were of cloth covered rope only the roundswere of wood so that at every step there was a joint at my firstglimpse of the pulpit it had not escaped me that however convenientfor a ship these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary for i was not prepared to see father mapple after gaining the height slowly turn round and stooping over the pulpit deliberately dragup the ladder step by step till the whole was deposited within leaving him impregnable in his little quebec i pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this father mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any meretricks of the stage no thought i there must be some sober reasonfor this thing furthermore it must symbolize something unseen can it be then that by that act of physical isolation he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time from all outwardworldly ties and connexions yes for replenished with the meatand wine of the word to the faithful man of god this pulpit i see is a self containing stronghold a lofty ehrenbreitstein with a perennial well of water within the walls but the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place borrowed from the chaplain s former sea farings between the marblecenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit the wall which formed its back wasadorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating againsta terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers but high above the flying scud and dark rolling clouds there floateda little isle of sunlight from which beamed forth an angel s face and this bright face shed a distant spot of radiance upon the ship stossed deck something like that silver plate now inserted intothe victory s plank where nelson fell ah noble ship the angelseemed to say beat on beat on thou noble ship and bear a hardy helm for lo the sun is breaking through the clouds are rolling off serenest azure is at hand nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the samesea taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture its panelled front was in the likeness of a ship s bluff bows and the holy bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work fashioned after a ship s fiddle headed beak what could be more full of meaning for the pulpit is ever thisearth s foremost part all the rest comes in its rear the pulpitleads the world from thence it is the storm of god s quick wrathis first descried and the bow must bear the earliest brunt from thence it is the god of breezes fair or foul is first invokedfor favorable winds yes the world s a ship on its passage out and not a voyage complete and the pulpit is its prow chapter the sermonfather mapple rose and in a mild voice of unassuming authorityordered the scattered people to condense star board gangway there side away to larboard larboard gangway to starboard midships midships there was a low rumbling of heavy sea boots among the benches and a still slighter shuffling of women s shoes and all was quiet again and every eye on the preacher he paused a little then kneeling in the pulpit s bows folded hislarge brown hands across his chest uplifted his closed eyes and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneelingand praying at the bottom of the sea this ended in prolonged solemn tones like the continualtolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog in such tones he commenced reading the following hymn but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy the ribs and terrors in the whale arched over me a dismal gloom while all god s sun lit waves rolled by and lift me deepening down to doom i saw the opening maw of hell with endless pains and sorrows there which none but they that feel can tell oh i was plunging to despair in black distress i called my god when i could scarce believe him mine he bowed his ear to my complaints no more the whale did me confine with speed he flew to my relief as on a radiant dolphin borne awful yet bright as lightning shonethe face of my deliverer god my song for ever shall recordthat terrible that joyful hour i give the glory to my god his all the mercy and the power nearly all joined in singing this hymn which swelled highabove the howling of the storm a brief pause ensued the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the bible and at last folding his hand down upon the proper page said beloved shipmates clinch the last verse of the first chapterof jonah and god had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah shipmates this book containing only four chapters four yarns is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cableof the scriptures yet what depths of the soul does jonah s deepsealine sound what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet what a noble thing is that canticle in the fish s belly how billow like and boisterously grand we feel the floods surgingover us we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters sea weed and all the slime of the sea is about us but what isthis lesson that the book of jonah teaches shipmates it isa two stranded lesson a lesson to us all as sinful men and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living god as sinful men it is a lesson to us all because it is a story of the sin hard heartedness suddenly awakened fears the swift punishment repentance prayers and finally the deliverance and joyof jonah as with all sinners among men the sin of this sonof amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of god never mind now what that command was or how conveyed which he found a hard command but all the things that godwould have us do are hard for us to do remember that and hence he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade and if we obey god we must disobey ourselves and it is in thisdisobeying ourselves wherein the hardness of obeying god consists with this sin of disobedience in him jonah still furtherflouts at god by seeking to flee from him he thinksthat a ship made by men will carry him into countrieswhere god does not reign but only the captains of this earth he skulks about the wharves of joppa and seeks a ship that sbound for tarshish there lurks perhaps a hitherto unheededmeaning here by all accounts tarshish could have been no othercity than the modern cadiz that s the opinion of learned men and where is cadiz shipmates cadiz is in spain as far by water from joppa as jonah could possibly have sailed in thoseancient days when the atlantic was an almost unknown sea because joppa the modern jaffa shipmates is on the mosteasterly coast of the mediterranean the syrian and tarshishor cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that just outside the straits of gibraltar see ye not then shipmates that jonah sought to flee worldwide from god miserable man oh most contemptible and worthy of all scorn with slouchedhat and guilty eye skulking from his god prowling amongthe shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas so disordered self condemning is his look that had therebeen policemen in those days jonah on the mere suspicionof something wrong had been arrested ere he touched a deck how plainly he s a fugitive no baggage not a hat box valise or carpet bag no friends accompany him to the wharf withtheir adieux at last after much dodging search he findsthe tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo and as he steps on board to see its captain in the cabin all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods to mark the stranger s evil eye jonah sees this but in vainhe tries to look all ease and confidence in vain essays hiswretched smile strong intuitions of the man assure the marinershe can be no innocent in their gamesome but still serious way one whispers to the other jack he s robbed a widow or joe do you mark him he s a bigamist or harry lad i guess he s the adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah or belike one of the missing murderers from sodom another runsto read the bill that s stuck against the spile upon the wharfto which the ship is moored offering five hundred gold coinsfor the apprehension of a parricide and containing a descriptionof his person he reads and looks from jonah to the bill while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round jonah prepared to lay their hands upon him frighted jonah trembles and summoning all his boldness to his face only looks so muchthe more a coward he will not confess himself suspected but that itself is strong suspicion so he makes the best of it and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised they let him pass and he descends into the cabin who s there cries the captain at his busy desk hurriedly makingout his papers for the customs who s there oh how that harmlessquestion mangles jonah for the instant he almost turns to flee again but he rallies i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish how soon sail ye sir thus far the busy captain had not looked upto jonah though the man now stands before him but no sooner doeshe hear that hollow voice than he darts a scrutinizing glance we sail with the next coming tide at last he slowly answered still intently eyeing him no sooner sir soon enough for anyhonest man that goes a passenger ha jonah that s another stab but he swiftly calls away the captain from that scent i ll sail with ye he says the passage money how much is that i ll pay now for it is particularly written shipmates as if itwere a thing not to be overlooked in this history that he paidthe fare thereof ere the craft did sail and taken with the context this is full of meaning now jonah s captain shipmates was one whose discernment detectscrime in any but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless in this world shipmates sin that pays its way can travelfreely and without a passport whereas virtue if a pauper is stopped at all frontiers so jonah s captain preparesto test the length of jonah s purse ere he judge him openly he charges him thrice the usual sum and it s assented to then the captain knows that jonah is a fugitive but at the sametime resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold yet when jonah fairly takes out his purse prudent suspicions stillmolest the captain he rings every coin to find a counterfeit not a forger any way he mutters and jonah is put down for his passage point out my state room sir says jonah now i m travel weary i need sleep thou look st like it says the captain there s thy room jonah enters and would lock the door but the lock contains no key hearing him foolishly fumbling there the captain laughs lowly to himself and mutters something aboutthe doors of convicts cells being never allowed to be locked within all dressed and dusty as he is jonah throws himself into his berth and finds the little state room ceiling almost resting on his forehead the air is close and jonah gasps then in that contracted hole sunk too beneath the ship s water line jonah feels the heraldingpresentiment of that stifling hour when the whale shall hold himin the smallest of his bowels wards screwed at its axis against the side a swinging lamp slightlyoscillates in jonah s room and the ship heeling over towards the wharfwith the weight of the last bales received the lamp flame and all though in slight motion still maintains a permanent obliquity withreference to the room though in truth infallibly straight itself it but made obvious the false lying levels among which it hung the lamp alarms and frightens jonah as lying in his berthhis tormented eyes roll round the place and this thus farsuccessful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance but that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him the floor the ceiling and the side are all awry oh so my conscience hangs in me he groans straight upward so it burns but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed still reeling but with conscience yet pricking him as the plungingsof the roman race horse but so much the more strike his steel tagsinto him as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turnsin giddy anguish praying god for annihilation until the fit be passed and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels a deep stupor steals over him as over the man who bleeds to death for conscience is the wound and there s naught to staunch it so after sore wrestling in his berth jonah s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep and now the time of tide has come the ship casts off her cables and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish all careening glides to sea that ship my friends was the first of recorded smugglers the contrabandwas jonah but the sea rebels he will not bear the wicked burden a dreadful storm comes on the ship is like to break but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her when boxes bales and jars are clattering overboard when the wind is shrieking and the men are yelling and everyplank thunders with trampling feet right over jonah s head in all this raging tumult jonah sleeps his hideous sleep he sees no black sky and raging sea feels not the reeling timbers and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him aye shipmates jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship a berth in the cabin as i have taken it and was fast asleep but the frightened master comes to him and shrieks in his dead ear what meanest thou o sleeper arise startled from his lethargyby that direful cry jonah staggers to his feet and stumblingto the deck grasps a shroud to look out upon the sea but at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leapingover the bulwarks wave after wave thus leaps into the ship and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat and ever as the white moon shows her affrighted face fromthe steep gullies in the blackness overhead aghast jonahsees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward but soon beatdownward again towards the tormented deep terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul in all hiscringing attitudes the god fugitive is now too plainly known the sailors mark him more and more certain grow their suspicionsof him and at last fully to test the truth by referringthe whole matter to high heaven they all outward to casting lots to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them the lot is jonah s that discovered then how furiously theymob him with their questions what is thine occupation whence comest thou thy country what people but mark now my shipmates the behavior of poor jonah the eager marinersbut ask him who he is and where from whereas they not onlyreceive an answer to those questions but likewise another answerto a question not put by them but the unsolicited answer isforced from jonah by the hard hand of god that is upon him i am a hebrew he cries and then i fear the lordthe god of heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land fear him o jonah aye well mightest thou fear the lord god then straightway he now goes on to make a full confession whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled but stillare pitiful for when jonah not yet supplicating god for mercy since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts when wretched jonah cries out to them to take him and casthim forth into the sea for he knew that for his sake thisgreat tempest was upon them they mercifully turn from him and seek by other means to save the ship but all in vain the indignant gale howls louder then with one hand raisedinvokingly to god with the other they not unreluctantly layhold of jonah and now behold jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east and the sea is still as jonah carries down the gale with him leaving smooth water behind he goes down in the whirling heart of sucha masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he dropsseething into the yawning jaws awaiting him and the whale shoots toall his ivory teeth like so many white bolts upon his prison then jonah prayed unto the lord out of the fish s belly but observe his prayer and so many white bolts upon his prison then jonah prayed unto learn a weighty lesson for sinfulas he is jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance he feels that his dreadful punishment is just he leaves all hisdeliverance to god contenting himself with this that spite of allhis pains and pangs he will still look towards his holy temple and here shipmates is true and faithful repentance not clamorous for pardon but grateful for punishment and how pleasing to god was this conduct in jonah is shownin the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale shipmates i do not place jonah before you to be copied for hissin but i do place him before you as a model for repentance sin not but if you do take heed to repent of it like jonah while he was speaking these words the howling of the shrieking slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher who when describing jonah s sea storm seemed tossed by a storm himself his deep chest heaved as with a ground swell his tossed armsseemed the warring elements at work and the thunders that rolledaway from off his swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that wasstrange to them there now came a lull in his look as he silently turned overthe leaves of the book once more and at last standing motionless with closed eyes for the moment seemed communing with god and himself but again he leaned over towards the people and bowing hishead lowly with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility he spake these words shipmates god has laid but one hand upon you both his handspress upon me i have read ye by what murky light may be minethe lesson that jonah teaches to all sinners and therefore to ye and still more to me for i am a greater sinner than ye and now how gladly would i come down from this mast head and siton the hatches there where you sit and listen as you listen while some one of you reads me that other and more awful lessonwhich jonah teaches to me as a pilot of the living god how beingan anointed pilot prophet or speaker of true things and biddenby the lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of awicked nineveh jonah appalled at the hostility he should raise fled from his mission and sought to escape his duty and his god by takingship at joppa but god is everywhere tarshish he never reached as we have seen god came upon him in the whale and swallowedhim down to living gulfs of doom and with swift slantings torehim along into the midst of the seas where the eddying depthssucked him ten thousand fathoms down and the weeds were wrappedabout his head and all the watery world of woe bowled over him yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet out of the bellyof hell when the whale grounded upon the ocean s utmost bones even then god heard the engulphed repenting prophet when he cried then god spake unto the fish and from the shuddering coldand blackness of the sea the whale came breeching up towardsthe warm and pleasant sun and all the delights of air and earth and vomited out jonah upon the dry land when the word of the lordcame a second time and jonah bruised and beaten his ears like two sea shells still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean jonah did the almighty s bidding and what was that shipmates to preach the truth to the face of falsehood that was it this shipmates this is that other lesson and woe to thatpilot of the living god who slights it woe to him whom thisworld charms from gospel duty woe to him who seeks to pouroil upon the waters when god has brewed them into a gale woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness woe to him who in this world courts not dishonor woe to him who would not be true even though to be falsewere salvation yea woe to him who as the great pilot paulhas it while preaching to others is himself a castaway he drooped and fell away from himself for a moment then liftinghis face to them again showed a deep joy in his eyes as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm but oh shipmates on the starboard hand of every woe there is a sure delight and higher the top of that delight than the bottom of the woeis deep is not the main truck higher than the kelson is low delight is to him a far far upward and inward delight who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth ever stands forth his own inexorable self delight is to himwhose strong arms yet support him when the ship of this basetreacherous world has gone down beneath him delight is to him who gives no quarter in the truth and kills burns and destroysall sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of senatorsand judges delight top gallant delight is to him who acknowledgesno law or lord but the lord his god and is only a patriot to heaven delight is to him whom all the waves of the billows of the seasof the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure keelof the ages and eternal delight and deliciousness will be his who coming to lay him down can say with his final breath o father chiefly known to me by thy rod mortal or immortal here i die i have striven to be thine more than to be this world s or mine own yet this is nothing i leave eternity to thee for what is manthat he should live out the lifetime of his god he said no more but slowly waving a benediction covered his face withhis hands and so remained kneeling till all the people had departed and he was left alone in the place chapter a bosom friendreturning to the spouter inn from the chapel i found queequeg therequite alone he having left the chapel before the benediction some time he was sitting on a bench before the fire with his feet onthe stove hearth and in one hand was holding close up to hisface that little negro idol of his peering hard into its face and with a jack knife gently whittling away at its nose meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way but being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soon going tothe table took up a large book there and placing it on his lap begancounting the pages with deliberate regularity at every fiftieth page as i fancied stopping for a moment looking vacantly around him and giving utterance to a long drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment he would then begin again at the next fifty seeming to commence atnumber one each time as though he could not count more than fifty and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited with much interest i sat watching him savage though he was and hideously marred about the face at least to my taste his countenance yet had a something in it which was by nomeans disagreeable you cannot hide the soul through all hisunearthly tattooings i thought i saw the traces of a simplehonest heart and in his large deep eyes fiery black and bold there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils and besides all this there was a certain lofty bearing aboutthe pagan which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim he looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor whether it was too that his head being shaved his forehead wasdrawn out in freer and brighter relief and looked more expansivethan it otherwise would this i will not venture to decide but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one it may seem ridiculous but it reminded me of general washington s head as seen in the popular busts of him it had the same long regularlygraded retreating slope from above the brows which were likewisevery projecting like two long promontories thickly wooded on top queequeg was george washington cannibalistically developed whilst i was thus closely scanning him half pretending meanwhile to belooking out at the storm from the casement he never heeded my presence never troubled himself with so much as a single glance but appearedwholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous and especially considering the affectionate arm i had found thrownover me upon waking in the morning i thought this indifferenceof his very strange but savages are strange beings at times youdo not know exactly how to take them at first they are overawing their calm self collectedness of simplicity seems as socratic wisdom i had noticed also that queequeg never consorted at all or but verylittle with the other seamen in the inn he made no advances whatever appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances all this struck me as mighty singular yet upon second thoughts there was something almost sublime in it here was a man sometwenty thousand miles from home by the way of cape horn that is which was the only way he could get there thrown among peopleas strange to him as though he were in the planet jupiter and yethe seemed entirely at his ease preserving the utmost serenity content with his own companionship always equal to himself surely thiswas a touch of fine philosophy though no doubt he had never heardthere was such a thing as that but perhaps to be true philosophers we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving so soon as i hear that such or such a man gives himself out fora philosopher i conclude that like the dyspeptic old woman he must have broken his digester as i sat there in that now lonely room the fire burning low in that mild stage when after its first intensity has warmed the air it then only glows to be looked at the evening shades and phantomsgathering round the casements and peering in upon us silent solitary twain the storm booming without in solemn swells i began to be sensible of strange feelings i felt a melting in me no more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned againstthe wolfish world this soothing savage had redeemed it there he sat his very indifference speaking a nature in whichthere lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits wild he was a very sight of sights to see yet i began to feelmyself mysteriously drawn towards him and those same thingsthat would have repelled most others they were the very magnetsthat thus drew me i ll try a pagan friend thought i since christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy i drew my bench near him and made some friendly signsand hints doing my best to talk with him meanwhile at first he little noticed these advances but presently upon my referring to his last night s hospitalities he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows i told him yes whereat i thought he looked pleased perhaps a little complimented we then turned over the book together and i endeavored to explainto him the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the fewpictures that were in it thus i soon engaged his interest and from that we went to jabbering the best we could aboutthe various outer sights to be seen in this famous town soon i proposed a social smoke and producing his pouchand tomahawk he quietly offered me a puff and then we satexchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his and keeping itregularly passing between us if there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards mein the pagan s breast this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed it out and left us cronies he seemed to taketo me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as i to him and when our smoke was over he pressed his forehead against mine clasped me round the waist and said that henceforth wewere married meaning in his country s phrase that we werebosom friends he would gladly die for me if need should be in a countryman this sudden flame of friendship would haveseemed far too premature a thing to be much distrusted but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply after supper and another social chat and smoke we went to ourroom together he made me a present of his embalmed head took out his enormous tobacco wallet and groping under the tobacco drew out some thirty dollars in silver then spreading them onthe table and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions pushed one of them towards me and said it was mine i was going to remonstrate but he silenced me by pouringthem into my trowsers pockets i let them stay he then went about his evening prayers took out his idol and removed the paper firebrand by certain signs and symptoms i thought he seemed anxious for me to join him but wellknowing what was to follow i deliberated a moment whether in case he invited me i would comply or otherwise i was a good christian born and bred in the bosom of the infalliblepresbyterian church how then could i unite with this wild idolatorin worshipping his piece of wood but what is worship thoughti do you suppose now ishmael that the magnanimous god of heavenand earth pagans and all included can possibly be jealous of aninsignificant bit of black wood impossible but what is worship to do the will of god that is worship and what is the will of god to do to my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to me that is the will of god now queequeg is my fellow man and what do i wish that this queequeg would do to me why unite with mein my particular presbyterian form of worship consequently i mustthen unite with him in his ergo i must turn idolator so i kindled the shavings helped prop up the innocent little idol offered him burnt biscuit with queequeg salamed before him twiceor thrice kissed his nose and that done we undressed and wentto bed at peace with our own consciences and all the world but we did not go to sleep without some little chat how it is i know not but there is no place like a bed forconfidential disclosures between friends man and wife they say there open the very bottom of their souls to each other and someold couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning thus then in our hearts honeymoon lay i and queequeg a cosy loving pair chapter nightgownwe had lain thus in bed chatting and napping at short intervals and queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his browntattooed legs over mine and then drawing them back so entirely sociable and free and easy were we when at last by reason of our confabulations what little nappishness remainedin us altogether departed and we felt like getting up again though day break was yet some way down the future yes we became very wakeful so much so that our recumbentposition began to grow wearisome and by little and little wefound ourselves sitting up the clothes well tucked around us leaning against the headboard with our four knees drawn upclose together and our two noses bending over them as ifour knee pans were warming pans we felt very nice and snug the more so since it was so chilly out of doors indeed outof bed clothes too seeing that there was no fire in the room the more so i say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth some small part of you must be cold for there is no qualityin this world that is not what it is merely by contrast nothing exists in itself if you flatter yourself that youare all over comfortable and have been so a long time then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more but if like queequeg and me in the bed the tip of your nose or the crownof your head be slightly chilled why then indeed in the generalconsciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm for this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnishedwith a fire which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich for the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothingbut the blankets between you and your snugness and the coldof the outer air then there you lie like the one warm sparkin the heart of an arctic crystal we had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time when all at once i thought i would open my eyes for whenbetween sheets whether by day or by night and whetherasleep or awake i have a way of always keeping my eyes shut in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except hiseyes be closed as if darkness were indeed the proper elementof our essences though light be more congenial to our clayey part upon opening my eyes then and coming out of my own pleasantand self created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloomof the unilluminated twelve o clock at night i experienceda disagreeable revulsion nor did i at all object to the hintfrom queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light seeing that we were so wide awake and besides he felt a strongdesire to have a few quiet puffs from his tomahawk be it said that though i had felt such a strong repugnance to his smokingin the bed the night before yet see how elastic our stiff prejudicesgrow when love once love comes to bend them for now i likednothing better than to have queequeg smoking by me even in bed because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then i no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord s policy of insurance i was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortablenessof sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend with our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders we now passedthe tomahawk from one to the other till slowly there grewover us a blue hanging tester of smoke illuminated by the flameof the new lit lamp whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savageaway to far distant scenes i know not but he now spokeof his native island and eager to hear his history i begged him to go on and tell it he gladly complied though at the time i but ill comprehended not a few of his words yet subsequent disclosures when i had become more familiarwith his broken phraseology now enable me to present the wholestory such as it may prove in the mere skeleton i give chapter biographicalqueequeg was a native of kokovoko an island far away to the westand south it is not down on any map true places never are when a new hatched savage running wild about his native woodlandsin a grass clout followed by the nibbling goats as if he werea green sapling even then in queequeg s ambitious soul lurked a strong desire to see something more of christendomthan a specimen whaler or two his father was a high chief a king his uncle a high priest and on the maternal sidehe boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors there was excellent blood in his veins royal stuff though sadly vitiated i fear by the cannibal propensityhe nourished in his untutored youth a sag harbor ship visited his father s bay and queequeg soughta passage to christian lands but the ship having her fullcomplement of seamen spurned his suit and not all the kinghis father s influence could prevail but queequeg vowed a vow alone in his canoe he paddled off to a distant strait which heknew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island on one side was a coral reef on the other a low tongue of land covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water hiding his canoe still afloat among these thickets with itsprow seaward he sat down in the stern paddle low in hand and when the ship was gliding by like a flash he darted out gained her side with one backward dash of his foot capsizedand sank his canoe climbed up the chains and throwing himselfat full length upon the deck grappled a ring bolt there and swore not to let it go though hacked in pieces in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard suspended acutlass over his naked wrists queequeg was the son of a king and queequeg budged not struck by his desperate dauntlessness and his wild desire to visit christendom the captain at last relented and told him he might make himself at home but this fine young savage this sea prince of wales never saw the captain s cabin they put him down among the sailors and made a whaleman of him but like czar peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy if thereby he mighthappily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen for at bottom so he told me he was actuated by a profounddesire to learn among the christians the arts whereby to makehis people still happier than they were and more than that still better than they were but alas the practices of whalemensoon convinced him that even christians could be both miserableand wicked infinitely more so than all his father s heathens arrived at last in old sag harbor and seeing what the sailorsdid there and then going on to nantucket and seeing how they spenttheir wages in that place also poor queequeg gave it up for lost thought he it s a wicked world in all meridians i ll die a pagan and thus an old idolator at heart he yet lived among these christians wore their clothes and tried to talk their gibberish hence the queer ways about him though now some time from home by hints i asked him whether he did not propose going back and having a coronation since he might now consider his fatherdead and gone he being very old and feeble at the last accounts he answered no not yet and added that he was fearful christianity or rather christians had unfitted him for ascending the pureand undefiled throne of thirty pagan kings before him but by and by he said he would return as soon as he felthimself baptized again for the nonce however he proposedto sail about and sow his wild oats in all four oceans they had made a harpooneer of him and that barbed iron wasin lieu of a sceptre now i asked him what might be his immediate purpose touching hisfuture movements he answered to go to sea again in his old vocation upon this i told him that whaling was my own design and informedhim of my intention to sail out of nantucket as being the mostpromising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from he at once resolved to accompany me to that island ship aboardthe same vessel get into the same watch the same boat the same mess with me in short to share my every hap with bothmy hands in his boldly dip into the potluck of both worlds to all this i joyously assented for besides the affection i nowfelt for queequeg he was an experienced harpooneer and as such could not fail to be of great usefulness to one who like me was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling though wellacquainted with the sea as known to merchant seamen his story being ended with his pipe s last dying puff queequeg embraced me pressed his forehead against mine and blowing out the light we rolled over from each other this way and that and very soon were sleeping chapter wheelbarrownext morning monday after disposing of the embalmed headto a barber for a block i settled my own and comrade s bill using however my comrade s money the grinning landlord as well as the boarders seemed amazingly tickled at the suddenfriendship which had sprung up between me and queequeg especially as peter coffin s cock and bull stories about himhad previously so much alarmed me concerning the very personwhom i now companied with we borrowed a wheelbarrow and embarking our things including my own poorcarpet bag and queequeg s canvas sack and hammock away we went downto the moss the little nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf as we were going along the people stared not at queequeg so much for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms but we heededthem not going along wheeling the barrow by turns and queequegnow and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs i asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons to this in substance he replied that though what i hinted wastrue enough yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon because it was of assured stuff well tried in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales in short like manyinland reapers and mowers who go into the farmer s meadows armedwith their own scythes though in no wise obliged to furnish them even so queequeg for his own private reasons preferred his own harpoon shifting the barrow from my hand to his he told me a funnystory about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen it was in sag harbor the owners of his ship it seems had lenthim one in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house not to seem ignorant about the thing though in truth he wasentirely so concerning the precise way in which to managethe barrow queequeg puts his chest upon it lashes it fast and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf why said i queequeg you might have known better than that one would think didn t the people laugh upon this he told me another story the people of his islandof rokovoko it seems at their wedding feasts express the fragrantwater of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament onthe braided mat where the feast is held now a certain grand merchantship once touched at rokovoko and its commander from all accounts a very stately punctilious gentleman at least for a sea captain this commander was invited to the wedding feast of queequeg s sister a pretty young princess just turned of ten well when allthe wedding guests were assembled at the bride s bamboo cottage this captain marches in and being assigned the post of honor placed himself over against the punchbowl and betweenthe high priest and his majesty the king queequeg s father grace being said for those people have their grace as well as we though queequeg told me that unlike us who at such times lookdownwards to our platters they on the contrary copying the ducks glance upwards to the great giver of all feasts grace i say being said the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremonyof the island that is dipping his consecrated and consecratingfingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates seeing himself placed next the priest and noting the ceremony and thinking himself being captain of a ship as having plainprecedence over a mere island king especially in the king s own house the captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punch bowl taking it i suppose for a huge finger glass now said queequeg what you tink now didn t our people laugh at last passage paid and luggage safe we stood on board the schooner hoisting sail it glided down the acushnet river on one side new bedford rose in terraces of streets their ice covered trees allglittering in the clear cold air huge hills and mountains of caskson casks were piled upon her wharves and side by side the world wanderingwhale ships lay silent and safely moored at last while from others camea sound of carpenters and coopers with blended noises of fires and forgesto melt the pitch all betokening that new cruises were on the start that one most perilous and long voyage ended only begins a second and a second ended only begins a third and so on for ever and for aye such is the endlessness yea the intolerableness of all earthly effort gaining the more open water the bracing breeze waxed fresh the littlemoss tossed the quick foam from her bows as a young colt his snortings how i snuffed that tartar air how i spurned that turnpike earth that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heelsand hoofs and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which willpermit no records at the same foam fountain queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me his dusky nostrils swelled apart he showed his filed and pointed teeth on on we flew and our offing gained the moss did homage to the blast ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the sultan sideways leaning we sideways darted every ropeyarn tingling like a wire the two tall masts buckling like indian canes in land tornadoes so full of this reeling scene were we as we stood by theplunging bowsprit that for some time we did not notice the jeeringglances of the passengers a lubber like assembly who marvelledthat two fellow beings should be so companionable as thougha white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro but there were some boobies and bumpkins there who by their intensegreenness must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behindhis back i thought the bumpkin s hour of doom was come dropping his harpoon the brawny savage caught him in his arms and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength sent him high upbodily into the air then slightly tapping his stern in mid somerset the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet while queequeg turning his back upon him lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed itto me for a puff capting capting yelled the bumpkin running toward that officer capting capting here s the devil hallo you sir cried the captain a gaunt rib of the sea stalking up to queequeg what in thunder do you mean by that don t you know you might have killed that chap what him say said queequeg as he mildly turned to me he say said i that you came near kill e that man there pointing to the still shivering greenhorn kill e cried queequeg twisting his tattooed face into anunearthly expression of disdain ah him bevy small e fish e queequeg no kill e so small e fish e queequeg kill e big whale look you roared the captain i ll kill e you you cannibal if you try any more of your tricks aboard here so mind your eye but it so happened just then that it was high time for the captainto mind his own eye the prodigious strain upon the main sail hadparted the weather sheet and the tremendous boom was now flyingfrom side to side completely sweeping the entire after partof the deck the poor fellow whom queequeg had handled so roughly was swept overboard all hands were in a panic and to attemptsnatching at the boom to stay it seemed madness it flew fromright to left and back again almost in one ticking of a watch and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters nothing was done and nothing seemed capable of being done those on deck rushed toward the bows and stood eyeing the boomas if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale in the midstof this consternation queequeg dropped deftly to his knees and crawling under the path of the boom whipped hold of a rope secured one end to the bulwarks and then flinging the otherlike a lasso caught it round the boom as it swept over his head and at the next jerk the spar was that way trapped and all was safe the schooner was run into the wind and while the hands wereclearing away the stern boat queequeg stripped to the waist darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap for three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog throwing his long arms straight out before him and by turnsrevealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam i looked at the grand and glorious fellow but saw no one to be saved the greenhorn had gone down shooting himself perpendicularlyfrom the water queequeg now took an instant s glance around him and seeming to see just how matters were dived down and disappeared a few minutes more and he rose again one arm stillstriking out and with the other dragging a lifeless form the boat soon picked them up the poor bumpkin was restored all hands voted queequeg a noble trump the captain begged his pardon from that hour i clove to queequeg like a barnacle yea till poorqueequeg took his last long dive was there ever such unconsciousness he did not seem to think that he atall deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous societies he onlyasked for water fresh water something to wipe the brine off that done he put on dry clothes lighted his pipe and leaning againstthe bulwarks and mildly eyeing those around him seemed to be sayingto himself it s a mutual joint stock world in all meridians we cannibals must help these christians chapter nantucketnothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning so after a fine run we safely arrived in nantucket nantucket take out your map and look at it see what a real cornerof the world it occupies how it stands there away off shore more lonely than the eddystone lighthouse look at it a mere hillock and elbow of sand all beach without a background there is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as asubstitute for blotting paper some gamesome wights will tell youthat they have to plant weeds there they don t grow naturally that they import canada thistles that they have to send beyondseas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask that pieces of woodin nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in rome that people there plant toadstools before their houses to get underthe shade in summer time that one blade of grass makes an oasis three blades in a day s walk a prairie that they wear quicksand shoes something like laplander snow shoes that they are so shut up belted about every way inclosed surrounded and made an utter islandof by the ocean that to their very chairs and tables small clamswill sometimes be found adhering as to the backs of sea turtles but these extravaganzas only show that nantucket is no illinois look now at the wondrous traditional story of how thisisland was settled by the red men thus goes the legend in olden times an eagle swooped down upon the new englandcoast and carried off an infant indian in his talons with loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight overthe wide waters they resolved to follow in the same direction setting out in their canoes after a perilous passage theydiscovered the island and there they found an empty ivory casket the poor little indian s skeleton what wonder then that these nantucketers born on a beach should taketo the sea for a livelihood they first caught crabs and quahogsin the sand grown bolder they waded out with nets for mackerel more experienced they pushed off in boats and captured cod and at last launching a navy of great ships on the sea explored thiswatery world put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it peeped in at behring s straits and in all seasons and all oceansdeclared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass thathas survived the flood most monstrous and most mountainous that himmalehan salt sea mastodon clothed with such portentousnessof unconscious power that his very panics are more to be dreadedthan his most fearless and malicious assaults and thus have these naked nantucketers these sea hermits issuing from their ant hill in the sea overrun and conqueredthe watery world like so many alexanders parcelling out amongthem the atlantic pacific and indian oceans as the threepirate powers did poland let america add mexico to texas and pile cuba upon canada let the english overswarm all india and hang out their blazing banner from the sun two thirds of thisterraqueous globe are the nantucketer s for the sea is his he owns it as emperors own empires other seamen having but a rightof way through it merchant ships are but extension bridges armed ones but floating forts even pirates and privateers though following the sea as highwaymen the road they but plunderother ships other fragments of the land like themselves without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself the nantucketer he alone resides and riots on the sea he alone in bible language goes down to it in ships to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation there is his home there lies his business which a noah s floodwould not interrupt though it overwhelmed all the millionsin china he lives on the sea as prairie cocks in the prairie he hides among the waves he climbs them as chamois huntersclimb the alps for years he knows not the land so thatwhen he comes to it at last it smells like another world more strangely than the moon would to an earthsman with thelandless gull that at sunset folds her wings and is rockedto sleep between billows so at nightfall the nantucketer out of sight of land furls his sails and lays him to his rest while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales chapter chowderit was quite late in the evening when the little moss came snuglyto anchor and queequeg and i went ashore so we could attendto no business that day at least none but a supper and a bed the landlord of the spouter inn had recommended us to his cousinhosea hussey of the try pots whom he asserted to be the proprietor of oneof the best kept hotels in all nantucket and moreover he had assuredus that cousin hosea as he called him was famous for his chowders in short he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do betterthan try pot luck at the try pots but the directions he had givenus about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till weopened a white church to the larboard and then keeping that onthe larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard and that done then ask the first man we met where the place was these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first especially as at the outset queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse our first point of departure must be left on the larboard hand whereas i had understood peter coffin to say it was on the starboard however by dint of beating about a little in the dark and nowand then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way we at last came to something which there was no mistaking two enormous wooden pots painted black and suspended by asses ears swung from the cross trees of an old top mast planted in frontof an old doorway the horns of the cross trees were sawed off on theother side so that this old top mast looked not a little like a gallows perhaps i was over sensitive to such impressions at the time but i could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving a sort of crick was in my neck as i gazed up to the tworemaining horns yes two of them one for queequeg and one for me it s ominous thinks i a coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my firstwhaling port tombstones staring at me in the whalemen s chapel and here a gallows and a pair of prodigious black pots too are these last throwing out oblique hints touching tophet i was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckledwoman with yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porchof the inn under a dull red lamp swinging there that looked muchlike an injured eye and carrying on a brisk scolding with a manin a purple woollen shirt get along with ye said she to the man or i ll be combing ye come on queequeg said i all right there s mrs hussey and so it turned out mr hosea hussey being from home but leavingmrs hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed mrs hussey postponing further scolding for the present ushered us into a little room and seating us at a table spreadwith the relics of a recently concluded repast turned roundto us and said clam or cod what s that about cods ma am said i with much politeness clam or cod she repeated a clam for supper a cold clam is that what you mean mrs hussey says i but that s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time ain t it mrs hussey but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purpleshirt who was waiting for it in the entry and seeming to hear nothingbut the word clam mrs hussey hurried towards an open door leadingto the kitchen and bawling out clam for two disappeared queequeg said i do you think that we can make out a supperfor us both on one clam however a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to beliethe apparently cheerless prospect before us but when thatsmoking chowder came in the mystery was delightfully explained oh sweet friends hearken to me it was made of small juicy clams scarcely bigger than hazel nuts mixed with pounded ship biscuits and salted pork cut up into little flakes the whole enrichedwith butter and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage and in particular queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him and the chowderbeing surpassingly excellent we despatched it with great expedition when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of mrs hussey s clamand cod announcement i thought i would try a little experiment stepping to the kitchen door i uttered the word cod withgreat emphasis and resumed my seat in a few moments the savourysteam came forth again but with a different flavor and in goodtime a fine cod chowder was placed before us we resumed business and while plying our spoons in the bowl thinks ito myself i wonder now if this here has any effect on the head what s that stultifying saying about chowder headed people but look queequeg ain t that a live eel in your bowl where s your harpoon fishiest of all fishy places was the try pots which well deservedits name for the pots there were always boiling chowders chowder for breakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper till you began to look for fish bones coming through your clothes the area before the house was paved with clam shells mrs husseywore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra and hosea hussey hadhis account books bound in superior old shark skin there was a fishyflavor to the milk too which i could not at all account for till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among somefishermen s boats i saw hosea s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod s decapitated head looking very slipshod i assure ye supper concluded we received a lamp and directions from mrs husseyconcerning the nearest way to bed but as queequeg was aboutto precede me up the stairs the lady reached forth her arm and demanded his harpoon she allowed no harpoon in her chambers why not said i every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon but why not because it s dangerous says she ever since young stiggs coming from that unfort nt v y ge of his when he was gone four years and a half with only three barrelsof ile was found dead in my first floor back with his harpoonin his side ever since then i allow no boarders to take sichdangerous weepons in their rooms at night so mr queequeg for she had learned his name i will just take this here iron and keep it for you till morning but the chowder clam or codto morrow for breakfast men both says i and let s have a couple of smoked herringby way of variety chapter the shipin bed we concocted our plans for the morrow but to my surpriseand no small concern queequeg now gave me to understand that he hadbeen diligently consulting yojo the name of his black little god and yojo had told him two or three times over and stronglyinsisted upon it everyway that instead of our going together amongthe whaling fleet in harbor and in concert selecting our craft instead of this i say yojo earnestly enjoined that the selectionof the ship should rest wholly with me inasmuch as yojo purposedbefriending us and in order to do so had already pitched upona vessel which if left to myself i ishmael should infalliblylight upon for all the world as though it had turned out by chance and in that vessel i must immediately ship myself for the presentirrespective of queequeg i have forgotten to mention that in many things queequeg placedgreat confidence in the excellence of yojo s judgment and surprisingforecast of things and cherished yojo with considerable esteem as a rather good sort of god who perhaps meant well enough uponthe whole but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs now this plan of queequeg s or rather yojo s touchingthe selection of our craft i did not like that plan at all i had not a little relied on queequeg s sagacity to point outthe whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely but as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon queequeg i wasobliged to acquiesce and accordingly prepared to set about thisbusiness with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor that should quickly settle that trifling little affair next morning early leaving queequeg shut up with yojoin our little bedroom for it seemed that it was some sortof lent or ramadan or day of fasting humiliation and prayerwith queequeg and yojo that day how it was i never couldfind out for though i applied myself to it several times i never could master his liturgies and xxxix articles leaving queequeg then fasting on his tomahawk pipe and yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings i sallied out among the shipping after much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries i learnt that there were three shipsup for three years voyages the devil dam the tit bit and the pequod devil dam i do not know the origin of tit bit is obvious pequod you will no doubt remember was the name of a celebrated tribe of massachusetts indians now extinct as the ancient medes i peered and pryed aboutthe devil dam from her hopped over to the tit bit and finally going on board the pequod looked around her for a moment and then decided that this was the very ship for us you may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught i know square toed luggers mountainous japanese junks butter box galliots and what not but take my word for it you never saw such a rare oldcraft as this same rare old pequod she was a ship of the old school rather small if anything with an old fashioned claw footed lookabout her long seasoned and weather stained in the typhoons and calmsof all four oceans her old hull s complexion was darkened like a frenchgrenadier s who has alike fought in egypt and siberia her venerablebows looked bearded her masts cut somewhere on the coast of japan where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale her masts stoodstiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of cologne her ancientdecks were worn and wrinkled like the pilgrim worshipped flag stonein canterbury cathedral where beckett bled but to all these herold antiquities were added new and marvellous features pertaining tothe wild business that for more than half a century she had followed old captain peleg many years her chief mate before he commandedanother vessel of his own and now a retired seaman and one of theprincipal owners of the pequod this old peleg during the term of hischief mateship had built upon her original grotesqueness and inlaid it all over with a quaintness both of material and device unmatched byanything except it be thorkill hake s carved buckler or bedstead she was apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor his neckheavy with pendants of polished ivory she was a thing of trophies a cannibal of a craft tricking herself forth in the chased bonesof her enemies all round her unpanelled open bulwarks were garnishedlike one continuous jaw with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale inserted there for pins to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood but deftly travelledover sheaves of sea ivory scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverendhelm she sported there a tiller and that tiller was in one mass curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe the helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest felt likethe tartar when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw a noble craft but somehow a most melancholy all noble things aretouched with that now when i looked about the quarter deck for some one having authority in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage at first isaw nobody but i could not well overlook a strange sort of tent or rather wigwam pitched a little behind the main mast it seemedonly a temporary erection used in port it was of a conical shape some ten feet high consisting of the long huge slabs of limberblack bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws ofthe right whale planted with their broad ends on the deck a circleof these slabs laced together mutually sloped towards each other and at the apex united in a tufted point where the loose hairy fibreswaved to and fro like a top knot on some old pottowotamie sachem s head a triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship so thatthe insider commanded a complete view forward and half concealed in this queer tenement i at length foundone who by his aspect seemed to have authority and who it being noon and the ship s work suspended was now enjoyingrespite from the burden of command he was seated on anold fashioned oaken chair wriggling all over with curious carving and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacingof the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed there was nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearanceof the elderly man i saw he was brown and brawny like most old seamen and heavily rolled up in blue pilot cloth cut in the quaker style only there was a fine and almost microscopic net work of the minutestwrinkles interlacing round his eyes which must have arisen from hiscontinual sailings in many hard gales and always looking to windward for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together such eye wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl is this the captain of the pequod said i advancing to the doorof the tent supposing it be the captain of the pequod what dost thou wantof him he demanded i was thinking of shipping thou wast wast thou i see thou art no nantucketer ever been in a stove boat no sir i never have dost know nothing at all about whaling i dare say eh nothing sir but i have no doubt i shall soon learn i ve been several voyages in the merchant service and i think that merchant service be damned talk not that lingo to me dost see that leg i ll take that leg away from thy stern if ever thou talkest of the merchant service to me again marchant service indeed i suppose now ye feel considerableproud of having served in those marchant ships but flukes man what makes thee want to go a whaling eh it looks a littlesuspicious don t it eh hast not been a pirate hast thou didst not rob thy last captain didst thou dost not thinkof murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea i protested my innocence of these things i saw that underthe mask of these half humorous innuendoes this old seaman as an insulated quakerish nantucketer was full of hisinsular prejudices and rather distrustful of all aliens unless they hailed from cape cod or the vineyard but what takes thee a whaling i want to know that before ithink of shipping ye well sir i want to see what whaling is i want to see the world want to see what whaling is eh have ye clapped eye on captain ahab who is captain ahab sir aye aye i thought so captain ahab is the captain of this ship i am mistaken then i thought i was speaking to the captain himself thou art speaking to captain peleg that s who ye are speaking to young man it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fittedout for the voyage and supplied with all her needs including crew we are part owners and agents but as i was going to say if thou wantestto know what whaling is as thou tellest ye do i can put ye in a wayof finding it out before ye bind yourself to it past backing out clap eye on captain ahab young man and thou wilt find that he hasonly one leg what do you mean sir was the other one lost by a whale lost by a whale young man come nearer to me it was devoured chewed up crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chippeda boat ah ah i was a little alarmed by his energy perhaps also a little touchedat the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation but said as calmlyas i could what you say is no doubt true enough sir but how couldi know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though indeed i might have inferred as much from the simple factof the accident look ye now young man thy lungs are a sort of soft d ye see thou dost not talk shark a bit sure ye ve been to sea before now sure of that sir said i i thought i told you that i had been four voyagesin the merchant hard down out of that mind what i said about the marchant service don t aggravate me i won t have it but let us understand each other i have given thee a hint about what whaling is do ye yet feelinclined for it i do sir very good now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a livewhale s throat and then jump after it answer quick i am sir if it should be positively indispensable to do so not to be got rid of that is which i don t take to be the fact good again now then thou not only wantest to go a whaling to find out by experience what whaling is but ye also wantto go in order to see the world was not that what ye said i thought so well then just step forward there and takea peep over the weather bow and then back to me and tell mewhat ye see there for a moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request not knowing exactly how to take it whether humorously or in earnest but concentrating all his crow s feet into one scowl captain pelegstarted me on the errand going forward and glancing over the weather bow i perceivedthat the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood tide wasnow obliquely pointing towards the open ocean the prospectwas unlimited but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding not the slightest variety that i could see well what s the report said peleg when i came back what did ye see not much i replied nothing but water considerable horizon though and there s a squall coming up i think well what dost thou think then of seeing the world do ye wish to go round cape horn to see any more of it eh can t ye see the world where you stand i was a little staggered but go a whaling i must and i would and the pequod was as good a ship as any i thought the best and all this i now repeated to peleg seeing me so determined he expressed his willingness to ship me and thou mayest as well sign the papers right off he added come along with ye and so saying he led the waybelow deck into the cabin seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon andsurprising figure it turned out to be captain bildad who alongwith captain peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel the other shares as is sometimes the case in these ports being held by a crowd of old annuitants widows fatherless children and chancery wards each owning about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or a nail or two in the ship people in nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringingin good interest now bildad like peleg and indeed many other nantucketers was a quaker the island having been originally settled by that sect and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommonmeasure the peculiarities of the quaker only variously andanomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous for some of these same quakers are the most sanguinaryof all sailors and whale hunters they are fighting quakers they are quakers with a vengeance so that there are instances among them of men who named withscripture names a singularly common fashion on the island and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic theeand thou of the quaker idiom still from the audacious daring and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities a thousandbold dashes of character not unworthy a scandinavian sea king or a poetical pagan roman and when these things unitein a man of greatly superior natural force with a globularbrain and a ponderous heart who has also by the stillnessand seclusion of many long night watches in the remotest waters and beneath constellations never seen here at the north been led to think untraditionally and independently receiving allnature s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virginvoluntary and confiding breast and thereby chiefly but with somehelp from accidental advantages to learn a bold and nervouslofty language that man makes one in a whole nation s census a mighty pageant creature formed for noble tragedies nor will it at all detract from him dramatically regarded if either by birth or other circumstances he have what seemsa half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature for all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness be sure of this o young ambition all mortal greatness isbut disease but as yet we have not to do with such an one but with quite another and still a man who if indeed peculiar it only results again from another phase of the quaker modified by individual circumstances like captain peleg captain bildad was a well to do retired whaleman but unlike captain peleg who cared not a rush for what are calledserious things and indeed deemed those self same serious thingsthe veriest of all trifles captain bildad had not only been originallyeducated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism but all his subsequent ocean life and the sight of many unclad lovely island creatures round the horn all that had not moved thisnative born quaker one single jot had not so much as altered one angleof his vest still for all this immutableness was there some lackof common consistency about worthy captain bildad though refusing from conscientious scruples to bear arms against land invaders yet himself had illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed yet had he in hisstraight bodied coat spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore how now in the contemplative evening of his days the pious bildadreconciled these things in the reminiscence i do not know but it did not seem to concern him much and very probably he hadlong since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man sreligion is one thing and this practical world quite another this world pays dividends rising from a little cabin boyin short clothes of the drabbest drab to a harpooneer in a broadshad bellied waistcoat from that becoming boat header chief mate and captain and finally a shipowner bildad as i hinted before had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from activelife at the goodly age of sixty and dedicating his remaining daysto the quiet receiving of his well earned income now bildad i am sorry to say had the reputation of beingan incorrigible old hunks and in his sea going days a bitter hard task master they told me in nantucket though itcertainly seems a curious story that when he sailed the oldcategut whaleman his crew upon arriving home were mostly allcarried ashore to the hospital sore exhausted and worn out for a pious man especially for a quaker he was certainlyrather hard hearted to say the least he never used to swear though at his men they said but somehow he got an inordinatequantity of cruel unmitigated hard work out of them when bildad was a chief mate to have his drab colored eyeintently looking at you made you feel completely nervous till you could clutch something a hammer or a marling spike and go to work like mad at something or other never mind what indolence and idleness perished from before him his ownperson was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character on his long gaunt body he carried no spare flesh no superfluous beard his chin having a soft economical nap to it like the worn nap of his broad brimmed hat such then was the person that i saw seated on the transomwhen i followed captain peleg down into the cabin the space between the decks was small and there bolt upright sat old bildad who always sat so and never leaned and thisto save his coat tails his broad brim was placed beside him his legs were stiffly crossed his drab vesture was buttonedup to his chin and spectacles on nose he seemed absorbedin reading from a ponderous volume bildad cried captain peleg at it again bildad eh ye havebeen studying those scriptures now for the last thirty years to my certain knowledge how far ye got bildad as if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate bildad without noticing his present irreverence quietly looked up and seeing me glanced again inquiringly towards peleg he says he s our man bildad said peleg he wants to ship dost thee said bildad in a hollow tone and turning round to me i dost said i unconsciously he was so intense a quaker what do ye think of him bildad said peleg he ll do said bildad eyeing me and then went on spellingaway at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible i thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw especially as peleg his friend and old shipmate seemed such a blusterer but i said nothing only looking round me sharply peleg now threw open a chest and drawing forth the ship s articles placed pen and ink before him and seated himself at a little table i began to think it was high time to settle with myselfat what terms i would be willing to engage for the voyage i was already aware that in the whaling business theypaid no wages but all hands including the captain received certain shares of the profits called lays and thatthese lays were proportioned to the degree of importancepertaining to the respective duties of the ship s company i was also aware that being a green hand at whaling my ownlay would not be very large but considering that i was usedto the sea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that i made no doubt that from all i had heard i should be offeredat least the th lay that is the th part of the clear netproceeds of the voyage whatever that might eventually amount to and though the th lay was what they call a rather long lay yet it was better than nothing and if we had a lucky voyage might pretty nearly pay for the clothing i would wear out on it not to speak of my three years beef and board for which iwould not have to pay one stiver it might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulatea princely fortune and so it was a very poor way indeed but i am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me while iam putting up at this grim sign of the thunder cloud upon the whole i thought that the th lay would be about the fair thing but would not have been surprised had i been offered the th considering i was of a broad shouldered make but one thing nevertheless that made me a little distrustful aboutreceiving a generous share of the profits was this ashore i had heardsomething of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad how that they being the principal proprietors of the pequod therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners left nearly the whole management of the ship s affairs to these two and i did not know but what the stingy old bildad might have a mightydeal to say about shipping hands especially as i now found him on boardthe pequod quite at home there in the cabin and reading his bibleas if at his own fireside now while peleg was vainly trying to menda pen with his jack knife old bildad to my no small surprise considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings bildad never heeded us but went on mumbling to himself out of his book lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth well captain bildad interrupted peleg what d ye say what lay shall we give this young man thou knowest best was the sepulchral reply the seven hundredand seventy seventh wouldn t be too much would it where mothand rust do corrupt but lay lay indeed thought i and such a lay the seven hundred andseventy seventh well old bildad you are determined that i for one shall not lay up many lays here below where moth and rust do corrupt it was an exceedingly long lay that indeed and though from the magnitudeof the figure it might at first deceive a landsman yet the slightestconsideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy sevenis a pretty large number yet when you come to make a teenth of it you will then see i say that the seven hundred and seventy seventh partof a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy sevengold doubloons and so i thought at the time why blast your eyes bildad cried peleg thou dost not wantto swindle this young man he must have more than that seven hundred and seventy seventh again said bildad without liftinghis eyes and then went on mumbling for where your treasure is there will your heart be also i am going to put him down for the three hundredth said peleg do ye hear that bildad the three hundredth lay i say bildad laid down his book and turning solemnly towardshim said captain peleg thou hast a generous heart but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the otherowners of this ship widows and orphans many of them and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans the seven hundred and seventy seventh lay captain peleg thou bildad roared peleg starting up and clattering about the cabin blast ye captain bildad if i had followed thy advice in these matters i would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavyenough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round cape horn captain peleg said bildad steadily thy conscience may bedrawing ten inches of water or ten fathoms i can t tell but as thou art still an impenitent man captain peleg i greatlyfear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one and will in the endsink thee foundering down to the fiery pit captain peleg fiery pit fiery pit ye insult me man past all natural bearing ye insult me it s an all fired outrage to tell any human creaturethat he s bound to hell flukes and flames bildad say that againto me and start my soulbolts but i ll i ll yes i ll swallow a livegoat with all his hair and horns on out of the cabin ye canting drab colored son of a wooden gun a straight wake with ye as he thundered out this he made a rush at bildad but with amarvellous oblique sliding celerity bildad for that time eluded him alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principaland responsible owners of the ship and feeling half a mindto give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionablyowned and temporarily commanded i stepped aside from the doorto give egress to bildad who i made no doubt was all eagernessto vanish from before the awakened wrath of peleg but tomy astonishment he sat down again on the transom very quietly and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing he seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his ways as for peleg after letting off his rage as he had there seemedno more left in him and he too sat down like a lamb though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated whew he whistled at last the squall s gone off to leeward i think bildad thou used to be good at sharpening a lance mend that pen will ye my jack knife here needs the grindstone that s he thank ye bildad now then my young man ishmael s thy name didn t ye say well then down yego here ishmael for the three hundredth lay captain peleg said i i have a friend with me who wants to ship too shall i bring him down to morrow to be sure said peleg fetch him along and we ll look at him what lay does he want groaned bildad glancing up from the bookin which he had again been burying himself oh never thee mind about that bildad said peleg has he everwhaled it any turning to me killed more whales than i can count captain peleg well bring him along then and after signing the papers off i went nothing doubting but that ihad done a good morning s work and that the pequod was the identicalship that yojo had provided to carry queequeg and me round the cape but i had not proceeded far when i began to bethink methat the captain with whom i was to sail yet remained unseenby me though indeed in many cases a whale ship will becompletely fitted out and receive all her crew on board ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged and the shoreintervals at home so exceedingly brief that if the captainhave a family or any absorbing concernment of that sort he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea however it is always as well to have a look at himbefore irrevocably committing yourself into his hands turning back i accosted captain peleg inquiring where captain ahabwas to be found and what dost thou want of captain ahab it s all right enough thou art shipped yes but i should like to see him but i don t think thou wilt be able to at present i don t knowexactly what s the matter with him but he keeps close inside the house a sort of sick and yet he don t look so in fact he ain t sick but no he isn t well either any how young man he won t always see me so i don t suppose he will thee he s a queer man captain ahab so some think but a good one oh thou lt like him well enough no fear no fear he s a grand ungodly god like man captain ahab doesn t speak much but when he does speak then you may well listen mark ye be forewarned ahab s above the common ahab s been in colleges as well as mong the cannibals been used to deeper wonders thanthe waves fixed his fiery lance in mightier stranger foes than whales his lance aye the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle oh he ain t captain bildad no and he ain t captain peleg he s ahab boy and ahab of old thou knowest was a crowned king and a very vile one when that wicked king was slain the dogs did they not lick his blood come hither to me hither hither said peleg with a significance in his eye that almost startled me look ye lad never say that on board the pequod never sayit anywhere captain ahab did not name himself twas a foolish ignorant whim of his crazy widowed mother who died whenhe was only a twelvemonth old and yet the old squaw tistig at gayhead said that the name would somehow prove prophetic and perhaps other fools like her may tell thee the same i wish to warn thee it s a lie i know captain ahab well i ve sailed with him as mate years ago i know what he is a good man not a pious good man like bildad but a swearinggood man something like me only there s a good deal moreof him aye aye i know that he was never very jolly and i know that on the passage home he was a little out of hismind for a spell but it was the sharp shooting pains in hisbleeding stump that brought that about as any one might see i know too that ever since he lost his leg last voyageby that accursed whale he s been a kind of moody desperate moody and savage sometimes but that will all pass off and once for all let me tell thee and assure thee young man it s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughingbad one so good bye to thee and wrong not captain ahab because he happens to have a wicked name besides my boy he has a wife not three voyages wedded a sweet resigned girl think of that by that sweet girl that old man had a child hold ye then there can be any utter hopeless harm in ahab no no my lad stricken blasted if he be ahab has his humanities as i walked away i was full of thoughtfulness what hadbeen incidentally revealed to me of captain ahab filled mewith a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him and somehow at the time i felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for i don t know what unless it was the cruel loss of his leg and yet i also felt a strange awe of him but that sort of awe which i cannot at all describe was not exactly awe i do notknow what it was but i felt it and it did not disinclineme towards him though i felt impatience at what seemed likemystery in him so imperfectly as he was known to me then however my thoughts were at length carried in other directions so that for the present dark ahab slipped my mind chapter the ramadanas queequeg s ramadan or fasting and humiliation was to continueall day i did not choose to disturb him till towards night fall for i cherish the greatest respect towards everybody s religiousobligations never mind how comical and could not find it in my heartto undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad stool or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth who witha degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merelyon account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rentedin his name i say we good presbyterian christians should be charitablein these things and not fancy ourselves so vastly superiorto other mortals pagans and what not because of their half crazyconceits on these subjects there was queequeg now certainlyentertaining the most absurd notions about yojo and his ramadan but what of that queequeg thought he knew what he was about i suppose he seemed to be content and there let him rest all our arguing with him would not avail let him be i say and heaven have mercy on us all presbyterians and pagans alike for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head and sadly need mending towards evening when i felt assured that all his performances andrituals must be over i went up to his room and knocked at the door but no answer i tried to open it but it was fastened inside queequeg said i softly through the key hole all silent i say queequeg why don t you speak it s i ishmael but allremained still as before i began to grow alarmed i had allowed himsuch abundant time i thought he might have had an apoplectic fit i looked through the key hole but the door opening into an odd cornerof the room the key hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one i could only see part of the foot board of the bed and a line of the wall but nothing more i was surprised to behold resting against the wallthe wooden shaft of queequeg s harpoon which the landlady the eveningprevious had taken from him before our mounting to the chamber that s strange thought i but at any rate since the harpoonstands yonder and he seldom or never goes abroad without it therefore he must be inside here and no possible mistake queequeg queequeg all still something musthave happened apoplexy i tried to burst open the door but it stubbornly resisted running down stairs i quicklystated my suspicions to the first person i met the chamber maid la la she cried i thought something must be the matter i went to make the bed after breakfast and the door was locked and not a mouse to be heard and it s been just so silent ever since but i thought may be you had both gone off and locked yourbaggage in for safe keeping la la ma am mistress murder mrs hussey apoplexy and with these cries she ran towardsthe kitchen i following mrs hussey soon appeared with a mustard pot in one handand a vinegar cruet in the other having just broken awayfrom the occupation of attending to the castors and scoldingher little black boy meantime wood house cried i which way to it run for god s sake and fetchsomething to pry open the door the axe the axe he s had a stroke depend upon it and so saying i was unmethodically rushing up stairsagain empty handed when mrs hussey interposed the mustard pot andvinegar cruet and the entire castor of her countenance what s the matter with you young man get the axe for god s sake run for the doctor some one while i pry it open look here said the landlady quickly putting downthe vinegar cruet so as to have one hand free look here are you talking about prying open any of my doors and with that she seized my arm what s the matter with you what s the matter with you shipmate in as calm but rapid a manner as possible i gave her to understandthe whole case unconsciously clapping the vinegar cruetto one side of her nose she ruminated for an instant then exclaimed no i haven t seen it since i put it there running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs she glancedin and returning told me that queequeg s harpoon was missing he s killed himself she cried it s unfort nate stiggs doneover again there goes another counterpane god pity his poor mother it will be the ruin of my house has the poor lad a sister where s that girl there betty go to snarles the painter and tell him to paint me a sign with no suicides permitted here and no smoking in the parlor might as well kill bothbirds at once kill the lord be merciful to his ghost what s that noise there you young man avast there and running up after me she caught me as i was again trying to forceopen the door i won t allow it i won t have my premises spoiled go for the locksmith there s one about a mile from here but avast putting her hand in her side pocket here s a key that ll fit i guess let s see and with that she turned it in the lock but alas queequeg s supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within have to burst it open said i and was running down the entrya little for a good start when the landlady caught at me again vowing i should not break down her premises but i torefrom her and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself fullagainst the mark with a prodigious noise the door flew open and the knobslamming against the wall sent the plaster to the ceiling and there good heavens there sat queequeg altogether cooland self collected right in the middle of the room squatting on his hams and holding yojo on top of his head he looked neither one way nor the other way but sat like a carvedimage with scarce a sign of active life queequeg said i going up to him queequeg what sthe matter with you he hain t been a sittin so all day has he said the landlady but all we said not a word could we drag out of him i almost felt like pushing him over so as to change his position for it was almost intolerable it seemed so painfully andunnaturally constrained especially as in all probabilityhe had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours going too without his regular meals mrs hussey said i he s alive at all events so leave us if you please and i will see to this strange affair myself closing the door upon the landlady i endeavored to prevailupon queequeg to take a chair but in vain there he sat and all he could do for all my polite arts and blandishments he would not move a peg nor say a single word nor even lookat me nor notice my presence in any the slightest way i wonder thought i if this can possibly be a part of his ramadan do they fast on their hams that way in his native island it must be so yes it s a part of his creed i suppose well then let him rest he ll get up sooner or later no doubt it can t last for ever thank god and his ramadan only comesonce a year and i don t believe it s very punctual then i went down to supper after sitting a long time listening to the longstories of some sailors who had just come from a plum pudding voyage as they called it that is a short whaling voyage in a schooner or brig confined to the north of the line in the atlantic ocean only after listening to these plum puddingers till nearly eleven o clock iwent up stairs to go to bed feeling quite sure by this time queequegmust certainly have brought his ramadan to a termination but no there he was just where i had left him he had not stirred an inch i began to grow vexed with him it seemed so downright senselessand insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hamsin a cold room holding a piece of wood on his head for heaven s sake queequeg get up and shake yourself get up and havesome supper you ll starve you ll kill yourself queequeg but nota word did he reply despairing of him therefore i determined to go to bed and to sleep and no doubt before a great while he would follow me but previous to turning in i took my heavy bearskin jacket and threw it over him as it promised to be a very cold night and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on for some time do all i would i could not get into the faintest doze i had blown out the candle and the mere thought of queequeg not four feet off sitting there in that uneasy position stark alone in the cold and dark this made me really wretched think of it sleeping all night in the same room with a wideawake pagan on his hams in this dreary unaccountable ramadan but somehow i dropped off at last and knew nothing more tillbreak of day when looking over the bedside there squattedqueequeg as if he had been screwed down to the floor but as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window up he got with stiff and grating joints but with a cheerful look limped towards me where i lay pressed his forehead againagainst mine and said his ramadan was over now as i before hinted i have no objection to any person s religion be it what it may so long as that person does not kill or insultany other person because that other person don t believe it also but when a man s religion becomes really frantic when it is a positivetorment to him and in fine makes this earth of ours an uncomfortableinn to lodge in then i think it high time to take that individualaside and argue the point with him and just so i now did with queequeg queequeg said i get into bed now and lie and listen to me i then went on beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions and coming down to the various religions of the present time during which time i labored to show queequeg that allthese lents ramadans and prolonged ham squattings in cold cheerless rooms were stark nonsense bad for the health useless for the soul opposed in short to the obvious lawsof hygiene and common sense i told him too that he beingin other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage it pained me very badly pained me to see him now so deplorablyfoolish about this ridiculous ramadan of his besides argued i fasting makes the body cave in hence the spirit caves in and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily behalf starved this is the reason why most dyspeptic religionistscherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters in one word queequeg said i rather digressively hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple dumpling and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsiasnurtured by ramadans i then asked queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia expressing the idea very plainly so that he could take it in he said no only upon one memorable occasion it was after a great feastgiven by his father the king on the gaining of a great battle whereinfifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o clock in the afternoon and all cooked and eaten that very evening no more queequeg said i shuddering that will do for i knew the inferences without his further hinting them i had seen a sailor who had visited that very island and he told methat it was the custom when a great battle had been gained there to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor and then one by one they were placed in great wooden trenchers and garnished round like a pilau with breadfruit and cocoanuts and with some parsley in their mouths were sent round withthe victor s compliments to all his friends just as thoughthese presents were so many christmas turkeys after all i do not think that my remarks about religion mademuch impression upon queequeg because in the first place he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject unless considered from his own point of view and in thesecond place he did not more than one third understand me couch my ideas simply as i would and finally he no doubt thoughthe knew a good deal more about the true religion than i did he looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible youngman should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety at last we rose and dressed and queequeg taking a prodigiously heartybreakfast of chowders of all sorts so that the landlady should not makemuch profit by reason of his ramadan we sallied out to board the pequod sauntering along and picking our teeth with halibut bones chapter his markas we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship queequeg carrying his harpoon captain peleg in his gruff voiceloudly hailed us from his wigwam saying he had not suspectedmy friend was a cannibal and furthermore announcing that he letno cannibals on board that craft unless they previouslyproduced their papers what do you mean by that captain peleg said i now jumpingon the bulwarks and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf i mean he replied he must show his papers yes said captain bildad in his hollow voice sticking his head frombehind peleg s out of the wigwam he must show that he s converted son of darkness he added turning to queequeg art thou at presentin communion with any christian church why said i he s a member of the first congregational church here be it said that many tattooed savages sailing in nantucketships at last come to be converted into the churches first congregational church cried bildad what that worshipsin deacon deuteronomy coleman s meeting house and so saying taking out his spectacles he rubbed them with his great yellowbandana handkerchief and putting them on very carefully came out of the wigwam and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks took a good long look at queequeg how long hath he been a member he then said turning to me not very long i rather guess young man no said peleg and he hasn t been baptized right either or it would have washed some of that devil s blue off his face do tell now cried bildad is this philistine a regular memberof deacon deuteronomy s meeting i never saw him going there and i pass it every lord s day i don t know anything about deacon deuteronomy or his meeting said i all i know is that queequeg here is a born member of thefirst congregational church he is a deacon himself queequeg is young man said bildad sternly thou art skylarking with me explain thyself thou young hittite what church dost theemean answer me finding myself thus hard pushed i replied i mean sir the sameancient catholic church to which you and i and captain peleg there and queequeg here and all of us and every mother s son and soulof us belong the great and everlasting first congregation of thiswhole worshipping world we all belong to that only some of uscherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief in that we all join hands splice thou mean st splice hands cried peleg drawing nearer young man you d better ship for a missionary instead of a fore mast hand i never heard a better sermon deacon deuteronomy why father mapple himself couldn t beat it and he s reckoned something come aboard come aboard never mind about the papers i say tell quohog there what s that you call him tell quohog to step along by the great anchor what a harpoon he s got there lookslike good stuff that and he handles it about right i say quohog or whatever your name is did you ever standin the head of a whale boat did you ever strike a fish without saying a word queequeg in his wild sort of way jumped uponthe bulwarks from thence into the bows of one of the whale boats hangingto the side and then bracing his left knee and poising his harpoon cried out in some such way as this cap ain you see him small drop tar on water dere you see him well spose him one whale eye well den and taking sharp aim at it he darted the iron right over old bildad s broad brim clean acrossthe ship s decks and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight now said queequeg quietly hauling in the line spos ee himwhale e eye why dad whale dead quick bildad said peleg his partner who aghast at the closevicinity of the flying harpoon had retreated towards the cabin gangway quick i say you bildad and get the ship s papers we must have hedgehog there i mean quohog in one of our boats look ye quohog we ll give ye the ninetieth lay and that s morethan ever was given a harpooneer yet out of nantucket so down we went into the cabin and to my great joy queequeg was soonenrolled among the same ship s company to which i myself belonged when all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything readyfor signing he turned to me and said i guess quohog there don tknow how to write does he i say quohog blast ye dost thou signthy name or make thy mark but at this question queequeg who had twice or thrice before takenpart in similar ceremonies looked no ways abashed but takingthe offered pen copied upon the paper in the proper place an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooedupon his arm so that through captain peleg s obstinate mistaketouching his appellative it stood something like this quohog his x mark meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing queequeg and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pocketsof his broadskirted drab coat took out a bundle of tracts and selecting one entitled the latter day coming or no timeto lose placed it in queequeg s hands and then grasping themand the book with both his looked earnestly into his eyes and said son of darkness i must do my duty by thee i am part ownerof this ship and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew if thou still clingest to thy pagan ways which i sadly fear i beseech thee remain not for aye a belial bondsman spurn the idol bell and the hideous dragon turn from the wrathto come mind thine eye i say oh goodness gracious steerclear of the fiery pit something of the salt sea yet lingered in old bildad s language heterogeneously mixed with scriptural and domestic phrases avast there avast there bildad avast now spoiling our harpooneer cried peleg pious harpooneers never make good voyagers it takes the shark out of em no harpooneer is worth a strawwho aint pretty sharkish there was young nat swaine once the bravest boat header out of all nantucket andthe vineyard he joined the meeting and never came to good he got so frightened about his plaguy soul that he shrinkedand sheered away from whales for fear of after claps in casehe got stove and went to davy jones peleg peleg said bildad lifting his eyes and hands thou thyself as i myself hast seen many a perilous time thou knowest peleg what it is to have the fear of death how then can st thou prate in this ungodly guise thou beliest thine own heart peleg tell me when this same pequodhere had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on japan that same voyage when thou went mate with captain ahab did st thou not think of death and the judgment then hear him hear him now cried peleg marching across the cabin and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets hear him all of ye think of that when every moment we thought the ship would sink death and the judgment then what with all three masts making suchan everlasting thundering against the side and every sea breakingover us fore and aft think of death and the judgment then no no time to think about death then life was what captain ahaband i was thinking of and how to save all hands how to rig jury mastshow to get into the nearest port that was what i was thinking of bildad said no more but buttoning up his coat stalked on deck where we followed him there he stood very quietly overlookingsome sailmakers who were mending a top sail in the waist now and then he stooped to pick up a patch or save an endof tarred twine which otherwise might have been wasted chapter the prophet shipmates have ye shipped in that ship queequeg and i had just left the pequod and were sauntering awayfrom the water for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts when the above words were put to us by a stranger who pausing before us levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question he was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck a confluentsmallpox had in all directions flowed over his face and left itlike the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent when the rushingwaters have been dried up have ye shipped in her he repeated you mean the ship pequod i suppose said i trying to gaina little more time for an uninterrupted look at him aye the pequod that ship there he said drawing back his wholearm and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him with the fixedbayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object yes said i we have just signed the articles anything down there about your souls about what oh perhaps you hav n t got any he said quickly no matter though i know many chaps that hav n t got any good luck to em and they are all the better off for it a soul s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon what are you jabbering about shipmate said i he s got enough though to make up for all deficienciesof that sort in other chaps abruptly said the stranger placing a nervous emphasis upon the word he queequeg said i let s go this fellow has broken loosefrom somewhere he s talking about something and somebodywe don t know stop cried the stranger ye said true ye hav n t seenold thunder yet have ye who s old thunder said i again riveted with the insane earnestnessof his manner captain ahab what the captain of our ship the pequod aye among some of us old sailor chaps he goes by that name ye hav n t seen him yet have ye no we hav n t he s sick they say but is getting better and will be all right again before long all right again before long laughed the stranger with a solemnlyderisive sort of laugh look ye when captain ahab is all right then this left arm of mine will be all right not before what do you know about him what did they tell you about him say that they didn t tell much of anything about him only i ve heard that he sa good whale hunter and a good captain to his crew that s true that s true yes both true enough but you must jump when he gives an order step and growl growl and go that s the word with captain ahab but nothingabout that thing that happened to him off cape horn long ago when he lay like dead for three days and nights nothing aboutthat deadly skrimmage with the spaniard afore the altar in santa heard nothing about that eh nothing about the silver calabashhe spat into and nothing about his losing his leg last voyage according to the prophecy didn t ye hear a word about themmatters and something more eh no i don t think ye did how could ye who knows it not all nantucket i guess but hows ever mayhap ye ve heard tell about the leg and how he lost it aye ye have heard of that i dare say oh yes that every one knows a most i mean they know he sonly one leg and that a parmacetti took the other off my friend said i what all this gibberish of yoursis about i don t know and i don t much care for it seemsto me that you must be a little damaged in the head but if you are speaking of captain ahab of that ship there the pequod then let me tell you that i know all about the lossof his leg all about it eh sure you do all pretty sure with finger pointed and eye levelled at the pequod the beggar likestranger stood a moment as if in a troubled reverie then startinga little turned and said ye ve shipped have ye names down onthe papers well well what s signed is signed and what s to be will be and then again perhaps it won t be after all any how it s all fixed and arranged a ready and some sailors or other must gowith him i suppose as well these as any other men god pity em morning to ye shipmates morning the ineffable heavens bless ye i m sorry i stopped ye look here friend said i if you have anything important to tell us out with it but if you are only trying to bamboozle us you are mistakenin your game that s all i have to say and it s said very well and i like to hear a chap talk upthat way you are just the man for him the likes of ye morning to ye shipmates morning oh when ye get there tell em i ve concluded not to make one of em ah my dear fellow you can t fool us that way you can t fool us it is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he hada great secret in him morning to ye shipmates morning morning it is said i come along queequeg let s leave thiscrazy man but stop tell me your name will you elijah elijah thought i and we walked away both commenting after each other s fashion upon this ragged old sailor and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear but we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards when chancingto turn a corner and looking back as i did so who should be seenbut elijah following us though at a distance somehow the sightof him struck me so that i said nothing to queequeg of hisbeing behind but passed on with my comrade anxious to seewhether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did he did and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us but with what intent i could not for the life of me imagine this circumstance coupled with his ambiguous half hinting half revealing shrouded sort of talk now begat in me allkinds of vague wonderments and half apprehensions and allconnected with the pequod and captain ahab and the leghe had lost and the cape horn fit and the silver calabash and what captain peleg had said of him when i left the shipthe day previous and the prediction of the squaw tistig and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail and a hundredother shadowy things i was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah wasreally dogging us or not and with that intent crossed the waywith queequeg and on that side of it retraced our steps but elijah passed on without seeming to notice us this relieved me and once more and finally as it seemed to me i pronounced him in my heart a humbug chapter all astira day or two passed and there was great activity aboardthe pequod not only were the old sails being mended but new sailswere coming on board and bolts of canvas and coils of rigging in short everything betokened that the ship s preparations werehurrying to a close captain peleg seldom or never went ashore but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look out upon the hands bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were workingtill long after night fall on the day following queequeg s signing the articles word was given at all the inns where the ship s companywere stopping that their chests must be on board before night for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing so queequeg and i got down our traps resolving however to sleepashore till the last but it seems they always give very longnotice in these cases and the ship did not sail for several days but no wonder there was a good deal to be done and there isno telling how many things to be thought of before the pequodwas fully equipped every one knows what a multitude of things beds sauce pans knivesand forks shovels and tongs napkins nut crackers and what not are indispensable to the business of housekeeping just so with whaling which necessitates a three years housekeeping upon the wide ocean far from all grocers costermongers doctors bakers and bankers and though this also holds true of merchant vessels yet not by any meansto the same extent as with whalemen for besides the great lengthof the whaling voyage the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecutionof the fishery and the impossibility of replacing them at the remoteharbors usually frequented it must be remembered that of all ships whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things uponwhich the success of the voyage most depends hence the spare boats spare spars and spare lines and harpoons and spare everythings almost but a spare captain and duplicate ship at the period of our arrival at the island the heaviest storageof the pequod had been almost completed comprising her beef bread water fuel and iron hoops and staves but as before hinted for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on boardof divers odds and ends of things both large and small chief among those who did this fetching and carrying wascaptain bildad s sister a lean old lady of a most determinedand indefatigable spirit but withal very kindhearted who seemedresolved that if she could help it nothing should be foundwanting in the pequod after once fairly getting to sea at one time she would come on board with a jar of picklesfor the steward s pantry another time with a bunch ofquills for the chief mate s desk where he kept his log a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one srheumatic back never did any woman better deserve her name which was charity aunt charity as everybody called her and like a sister of charity did this charitable aunt charitybustle about hither and thither ready to turn her hand and heartto anything that promised to yield safety comfort and consolationto all on board a ship in which her beloved brother bildadwas concerned and in which she herself owned a score or twoof well saved dollars but it was startling to see this excellent hearted quakeresscoming on board as she did the last day with a long oil ladlein one hand and a still longer whaling lance in the other nor was bildad himself nor captain peleg at all backward as for bildad he carried about with him a long listof the articles needed and at every fresh arrival down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper every once in a while peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den roaring at the men down the hatchways roaring up to theriggers at the mast head and then concluded by roaring backinto his wigwam during these days of preparation queequeg and i often visitedthe craft and as often i asked about captain ahab and how he was and when he was going to come on board his ship to these questionsthey would answer that he was getting better and better and wasexpected aboard every day meantime the two captains peleg and bildad could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage if i had been downright honest with myself i would have seenvery plainly in my heart that i did but half fancy being committedthis way to so long a voyage without once laying my eyes on the manwho was to be the absolute dictator of it so soon as the shipsailed out upon the open sea but when a man suspects any wrong it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself and much this way it was with me i said nothing and triedto think nothing at last it was given out that some time next day the shipwould certainly sail so next morning queequeg and i tooka very early start chapter going aboardit was nearly six o clock but only grey imperfect misty dawn when we drew nigh the wharf there are some sailors running ahead there if i see right said i to queequeg it can t be shadows she s off by sunrise i guess come on avast cried a voice whose owner at the same time comingclose behind us laid a hand upon both our shoulders and theninsinuating himself between us stood stooping forward a little in the uncertain twilight strangely peering from queequeg to me it was elijah going aboard hands off will you said i lookee here said queequeg shaking himself go way aint going aboard then yes we are said i but what business is that of yours do you know mr elijah that i consider you a little impertinent no no no i wasn t aware of that said elijah slowly and wonderinglylooking from me to queequeg with the most unaccountable glances elijah said i you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing we are going to the indian and pacific oceans and would prefernot to be detained ye be be ye coming back afore breakfast he s cracked queequeg said i come on holloa cried stationary elijah hailing us when we had removeda few paces never mind him said i queequeg come on but he stole up to us again and suddenly clapping his handon my shoulder said did ye see anything looking like mengoing towards that ship a while ago struck by this plain matter of fact question i answered saying yes ithought i did see four or five men but it was too dim to be sure very dim very dim said elijah morning to ye once more we quitted him but once more he came softly after us and touching my shoulder again said see if you can find em now will ye find who morning to ye morning to ye he rejoined again moving off oh i was going to warn ye against but never mind never mind it s all one all in the family too sharp frost this morning ain t it good bye to ye shan t see ye again very soon i guess unless it s before the grand jury and with these cracked wordshe finally departed leaving me for the moment in no smallwonderment at his frantic impudence at last stepping on board the pequod we found everything inprofound quiet not a soul moving the cabin entrance was locked within the hatches were all on and lumbered with coils of rigging going forward to the forecastle we found the slide of the scuttle open seeing a light we went down and found only an old rigger there wrapped in a tattered pea jacket he was thrown at whole length upontwo chests his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms the profoundest slumber slept upon him those sailors we saw queequeg where can they have gone to said i looking dubiously at the sleeper but it seemed that when on the wharf queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to hence i would have thought myself to have been optically deceived inthat matter were it not for elijah s otherwise inexplicable question but i beat the thing down and again marking the sleeper jocularly hinted to queequeg that perhaps we had best sit upwith the body telling him to establish himself accordingly he put his hand upon the sleeper s rear as though feeling if itwas soft enough and then without more ado sat quietly down there gracious queequeg don t sit there said i oh perry dood seat said queequeg my country way won t hurt him face face said i call that his face very benevolent countenance then but how hard he breathes he s heaving himself get off queequeg you are heavy it s grinding the face of the poor get off queequeg look he ll twitch you off soon i wonder he don t wake queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper and lighted his tomahawk pipe i sat at the feet we kept the pipe passing over the sleeper from one to the other meanwhile upon questioning him in his broken fashion queequeg gaveme to understand that in his land owing to the absence of setteesand sofas of all sorts the king chiefs and great people generally were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect you had onlyto buy up eight or ten lazy fellows and lay them round in the piersand alcoves besides it was very convenient on an excursion much better than those garden chairs which are convertible intowalking sticks upon occasion a chief calling his attendant and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree perhaps in some damp marshy place while narrating these things every time queequeg received the tomahawkfrom me he flourished the hatchet side of it over the sleeper s head what s that for queequeg perry easy kill e oh perry easy he was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk pipewhich it seemed had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothedhis soul when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger the strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole it began to tell upon him he breathed with a sort of muffledness then seemed troubled in the nose then revolved over once or twice then sat up and rubbed his eyes holloa he breathed at last who be ye smokers shipped men answered i when does she sail aye aye ye are going in her be ye she sails to day the captaincame aboard last night what captain ahab who but him indeed i was going to ask him some further questions concerning ahab when we heard a noise on deck holloa starbuck s astir said the rigger he s a lively chiefmate that good man and a pious but all alive now i must turn to and so saying he went on deck and we followed it was now clear sunrise soon the crew came on board in twos and threes the riggers bestirred themselves the mates were actively engaged and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various lastthings on board meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly enshrinedwithin his cabin chapter merry christmasat length towards noon upon the final dismissal of the ship s riggers and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf and after theever thoughtful charity had come off in a whale boat with her last gift a nightcap for stubb the second mate her brother in law and a sparebible for the steward after all this the two captains peleg and bildad issued from the cabin and turning to the chief mate peleg said now mr starbuck are you sure everything is right captain ahab is all ready just spoke to him nothing moreto be got from shore eh well call all hands then muster em aft here blast em no need of profane words however great the hurry peleg said bildad but away with thee friend starbuck and do our bidding how now here upon the very point of starting for the voyage captain peleg and captain bildad were going it with a high hand onthe quarter deck just as if they were to be joint commanders at sea as well as to all appearances in port and as for captain ahab no sign of him was yet to be seen only they said he was in the cabin but then the idea was that his presence was by no means necessaryin getting the ship under weigh and steering her well out to sea indeed as that was not at all his proper business but the pilot s and as he was not yet completely recovered so they said therefore captain ahab stayed below and all this seemed natural enough especially as in the merchant service many captains never showthemselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor but remain over the cabin table having a farewell merry making withtheir shore friends before they quit the ship for good with the pilot but there was not much chance to think over the matter for captain pelegwas now all alive he seemed to do most of the talking and commanding and not bildad aft here ye sons of bachelors he cried as the sailors lingeredat the main mast mr starbuck drive aft strike the tent there was the next order as i hinted before this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port and on board the pequod for thirty years the order to strikethe tent was well known to be the next thing to heavingup the anchor man the capstan blood and thunder jump was the next command and the crew sprang for the handspikes now in getting under weigh the station generally occupiedby the pilot is the forward part of the ship and here bildad who with peleg be it known in addition to his other offices was one of the licensed pilots of the port he being suspectedto have got himself made a pilot in order to save the nantucketpilot fee to all the ships he was concerned in for he neverpiloted any other craft bildad i say might now be seen activelyengaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody to cheer the hands at the windlass who roared forth some sortof a chorus about the girls in booble alley with hearty good will nevertheless not three days previous bildad had told themthat no profane songs would be allowed on board the pequod particularly in getting under weigh and charity his sister had placed a small choice copy of watts in each seaman s berth meantime overseeing the other part of the ship captain pelegripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner i almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor couldbe got up involuntarily i paused on my handspike and toldqueequeg to do the same thinking of the perils we both ran in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot i was comforting myself however with the thought that in piousbildad might be found some salvation spite of his seven hundredand seventy seventh lay when i felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear and turning round was horrified at the apparition of captain pelegin the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity that was my first kick is that the way they heave in the marchant service he roared spring thou sheep head spring and break thy backbone why don tye spring i say all of ye spring quohog spring thou chap withthe red whiskers spring there scotch cap spring thou green pants spring i say all of ye and spring your eyes out and so saying he moved along the windlass here and there using his leg very freely while imperturbable bildad kept leading off with his psalmody thinks i captain peleg must have been drinking something to day at last the anchor was up the sails were set and off we glided it was a short cold christmas and as the short northern day mergedinto night we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean whose freezing spray cased us in ice as in polished armor the long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant vast curvingicicles depended from the bows lank bildad as pilot headed the first watch and ever and anon as the old craft deep dived into the green seas and sent the shiveringfrost all over her and the winds howled and the cordage rang his steady notes were heard sweet fields beyond the swelling flood stand dressed in living green so to the jews old canaan stood while jordan rolled between never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then they were full of hope and fruition spite of this frigid winter nightin the boisterous atlantic spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket there was yet it then seemed to me many a pleasant haven in store and meads and glades so eternally vernal that the grass shot upby the spring untrodden unwilted remains at midsummer at last we gained such an offing that the two pilots wereneeded no longer the stout sail boat that had accompanied usbegan ranging alongside it was curious and not unpleasing how peleg and bildad wereaffected at this juncture especially captain bildad for loathto depart yet very loath to leave for good a ship boundon so long and perilous a voyage beyond both stormy capes a ship in which some thousands of his hardearned dollarswere invested a ship in which an old shipmate sailed as captain a man almost as old as he once more starting to encounterall the terrors of the pitiless jaw loath to say good byeto a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him poor old bildad lingered long paced the deck with anxious strides ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there again came on deck and looked to windward looked towardsthe wide and endless waters only bounded by the far off unseeneastern continents looked towards the land looked aloft looked right and left looked everywhere and nowhere and at last mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin convulsively grasped stout peleg by the hand and holding upa lantern for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face as much as to say nevertheless friend peleg i can stand it yes i can as for peleg himself he took it more like a philosopher but for all his philosophy there was a tear twinkling in his eye when the lantern came too near and he too did not a littlerun from the cabin to deck now a word below and now a wordwith starbuck the chief mate but at last he turned to his comrade with a final sort of lookabout him captain bildad come old shipmate we must go back the mainyard there boat ahoy stand by to comeclose alongside now careful careful come bildad boy say your last luck to ye starbuck luck to ye mr stubb luck to ye mr flask good bye and good luck to ye all and this day three years i ll have a hot supper smoking for yein old nantucket hurrah and away god bless ye and have ye in his holy keeping men murmured old bildad almost incoherently i hope ye ll have fine weather now so thatcaptain ahab may soon be moving among ye a pleasant sun is all he needs and ye ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go be carefulin the hunt ye mates don t stave the boats needlessly ye harpooneers good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent within the year don t forget your prayers either mr starbuck mind that cooper don twaste the spare staves oh the sail needles are in the green locker don t whale it too much a lord s days men but don t miss a fairchance either that s rejecting heaven s good gifts have an eyeto the molasses tierce mr stubb it was a little leaky i thought if ye touch at the islands mr flask beware of fornication good bye good bye don t keep that cheese too long down in the hold mr starbuck it ll spoil be careful with the butter twenty centsthe pound it was and mind ye if come come captain bildad stop palavering away and with that peleg hurried him over the side and both dropt into the boat ship and boat diverged the cold damp night breeze blew between a screaming gull flew overhead the two hulls wildly rolled we gave three heavy hearted cheers and blindly plunged like fateinto the lone atlantic chapter the lee shoresome chapters back one bulkington was spoken of a tall newlanded mariner encountered in new bedford at the inn

queequeg and i are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded amonglandsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit therefore i amall anxiety to convince ye ye landsmen of the injustice hereby doneto us hunters of whales in the first place it may be deemed almost superfluous to establishthe fact that among people at large the business of whaling is notaccounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions if a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits were hepresented to the company as a harpooneer say and if in emulation of thenaval officers he should append the initials s w f sperm whale fishery to his visiting card such a procedure would be deemed preeminentlypresuming and ridiculous doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoringus whalemen is this they think that at best our vocationamounts to a butchering sort of business and that when activelyengaged therein we are surrounded by all manner of defilements butchers we are that is true but butchers also and butchersof the bloodiest badge have been all martial commanders whomthe world invariably delights to honor and as for the matterof the alleged uncleanliness of our business ye shall soon beinitiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown and which upon the whole will triumphantly plant the spermwhale ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth but even granting the charge in question to be true what disorderedslippery decks of a whale ship are comparable to the unspeakablecarrion of those battle fields from which so many soldiers returnto drink in all ladies plaudits and if the idea of perilso much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier s profession let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched upto a battery would quickly recoil at the apparition of the spermwhale s vast tail fanning into eddies the air over his head for what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared withthe interlinked terrors and wonders of god but though the world scouts at us whale hunters yet does itunwittingly pay us the profoundest homage yea an all aboundingadoration for almost all the tapers lamps and candlesthat burn round the globe burn as before so many shrines to our glory but look at this matter in other lights weigh it in all sorts of scales see what we whalemen are and have been why did the dutch in de witt s time have admirals of theirwhaling fleets why did louis xvi of france at his ownpersonal expense fit out whaling ships from dunkirk and politelyinvite to that town some score or two of families from our own islandof nantucket why did britain between the years and pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of pounds and lastly how comes it that we whalemen of america now outnumberall the rest of the banded whalemen in the world sail a navy ofupwards of seven hundred vessels manned by eighteen thousand men yearly consuming of dollars the ships worth at the time of sailing dollars and every year importinginto our harbors a well reaped harvest of dollars how comes all this if there be not something puissant in whaling but this is not the half look again i freely assert that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot for his life point out one single peaceful influence which within the last sixty years has operated more potentiallyupon the whole broad world taken in one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whaling one wayand another it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues that whaling may well be regarded as that egyptian mother who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb it would be a hopeless endless task to catalogue all these things let a handful suffice for many years past the whale ship hasbeen the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least knownparts of the earth she has explored seas and archipelagoeswhich had no chart where no cooke or vancouver had ever sailed if american and european men of war now peacefully ridein once savage harbors let them fire salutes to the honorand glory of the whale ship which originally showed themthe way and first interpreted between them and the savages they may celebrate as they will the heroes of exploring expeditions your cookes your krusensterns but i say that scores of anonymouscaptains have sailed out of nantucket that were as great and greater than your cooke and your krusenstern for intheir succorless empty handedness they in the heathenishsharked waters and by the beaches of unrecorded javelin islands battled with virgin wonders and terrors that cooke with all hismarines and muskets would not willingly have willingly dared all that is made such a flourish of in the old south sea voyages those things were but the life time commonplaces of ourheroic nantucketers often adventures which vancouverdedicates three chapters to these men accounted unworthyof being set down in the ship s common log ah the world oh the world until the whale fishery rounded cape horn no commerce but colonial scarcely any intercourse but colonial was carried on between europeand the long line of the opulent spanish provinces on the pacific coast it was the whalemen who first broke through the jealous policy ofthe spanish crown touching those colonies and if space permitted it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuatedthe liberation of peru chili and bolivia from the yoke of old spain and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts that great america on the other side of the sphere australia was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman after its first blunder born discovery by a dutchman all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous but the whale ship touched there the whale ship is the truemother of that now mighty colony moreover in the infancyof the first australian settlement the emigrants were severaltimes saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit ofthe whale ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters the uncounted isles of all polynesia confess the same truth and do commercial homage to the whale ship that cleared the wayfor the missionary and the merchant and in many cases carriedthe primitive missionaries to their first destinations if that double bolted land japan is ever to become hospitable it is the whale ship alone to whom the credit will be due for already she is on the threshold but if in the face of all this you still declare that whalinghas no aesthetically noble associations connected with it then am i ready to shiver fifty lances with you there and unhorse you with a split helmet every time the whale has no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler you will say the whale no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler who wrote the first account of our leviathan who but mighty job and who composed the first narrative of a whaling voyage who but no less a prince than alfred the great who with his ownroyal pen took down the words from other the norwegianwhale hunter of those times and who pronounced our glowingeulogy in parliament who but edmund burke true enough but then whalemen themselves are poor devils they have no good blood in their veins no good blood in their veins they have something betterthan royal blood there the grandmother of benjamin franklinwas mary morrel afterwards by marriage mary folger one ofthe old settlers of nantucket and the ancestress to a long lineof folgers and harpooneers all kith and kin to noble benjamin this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the worldto the other good again but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable whaling not respectable whaling is imperial by old englishstatutory law the whale is declared a royal fish oh that s only nominal the whale himself has never figuredin any grand imposing way the whale never figured in any grand imposing way in one of the mightytriumphs given to a roman general upon his entering the world s capital the bones of a whale brought all the way from the syrian coast were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession see subsequent chapters for something more on this head grant it since you cite it but say what you will there is no realdignity in whaling no dignity in whaling the dignity of our calling the veryheavens attest cetus is a constellation in the south no more drive down your hat in presence of the czar and take it offto queequeg no more i know a man that in his lifetimehas taken three hundred and fifty whales i account that manmore honorable than that great captain of antiquity who boastedof taking as many walled towns and as for me if by any possibility there be any as yet undiscoveredprime thing in me if i shall ever deserve any real repute in that smallbut high hushed world which i might not be unreasonably ambitious of if hereafter i shall do anything that upon the whole a man might ratherhave done than to have left undone if at my death my executors or more properly my creditors find any precious mss in my desk then here i prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory to whaling for a whale ship was my yale college and my harvard chapter postscriptin behalf of the dignity of whaling i would fain advance naughtbut substantiated facts but after embattling his facts an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise which might tell eloquently upon his cause such an advocate would he not be blame worthy it is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens even modern ones a certain curious process of seasoning themfor their functions is gone through there is a saltcellarof state so called and there may be a caster of state how they use the salt precisely who knows certain i am however that a king s head is solemnly oiled at his coronation even as a head of salad can it be though that theyanoint it with a view of making its interior run well as they anoint machinery much might be ruminated here concerning the essential dignity of this regal process because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellowwho anoints his hair and palpably smells of that anointing in truth a mature man who uses hairoil unless medicinally that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere as a general rule he can t amount to much in his totality but the only thing to be considered here is this what kind of oil is usedat coronations certainly it cannot be olive oil nor macassar oil nor castor oil nor bear s oil nor train oil nor cod liver oil what then can it possibly be but the sperm oil in its unmanufactured unpolluted state the sweetest of all oils think of that ye loyal britons we whalemen supply your kingsand queens with coronation stuff chapter knights and squiresthe chief mate of the pequod was starbuck a native of nantucket and a quaker by descent he was a long earnest man and though born on an icy coast seemed well adapted to endurehot latitudes his flesh being hard as twice baked biscuit transported to the indies his live blood would not spoil likebottled ale he must have been born in some time of generaldrought and famine or upon one of those fast days for which hisstate is famous only some thirty arid summers had he seen those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness but this his thinness so to speak seemed no more the tokenof wasting anxieties and cares than it seemed the indicationof any bodily blight it was merely the condensation of the man he was by no means ill looking quite the contrary his pure tight skin was an excellent fit and closely wrappedup in it and embalmed with inner health and strength like a revivified egyptian this starbuck seemed preparedto endure for long ages to come and to endure always as now for be it polar snow or torrid sun like a patent chronometer his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates looking into his eyes you seemed to see there the yet lingeringimages of those thousand fold perils he had calmly confrontedthrough life a staid steadfast man whose life for the mostpart was a telling pantomime of action and not a tame chapterof sounds yet for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude there were certain qualities in him which at times affected and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest uncommonly conscientious for a seaman and endued with a deepnatural reverence the wild watery loneliness of his life didtherefore strongly incline him to superstition but to that sortof superstition which in some organizations seems ratherto spring somehow from intelligence than from ignorance outward portents and inward presentiments were his and if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul much more did his far away domestic memories of his young capewife and child tend to bend him still more from the originalruggedness of his nature and open him still further to those latentinfluences which in some honest hearted men restrain the gushof dare devil daring so often evinced by others in the moreperilous vicissitudes of the fishery i will have no manin my boat said starbuck who is not afraid of a whale by this he seemed to mean not only that the most reliableand useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimationof the encountered peril but that an utterly fearless manis a far more dangerous comrade than a coward aye aye said stubb the second mate starbuck there is as careful a man as you ll find anywhere in this fishery but we shall ere long see what that word careful precisely meanswhen used by a man like stubb or almost any other whale hunter starbuck was no crusader after perils in him courage was not a sentiment but a thing simply useful to him and always at hand upon all mortallypractical occasions besides he thought perhaps that in this businessof whaling courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be foolishly wasted wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun down nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted infighting him for thought starbuck i am here in this critical oceanto kill whales for my living and not to be killed by them for theirs and that hundreds of men had been so killed starbuck well knew what doom was his own father s where in the bottomless deeps could he find the torn limbs of his brother with memories like these in him and moreover given to a certainsuperstitiousness as has been said the courage of this starbuck which could nevertheless still flourish must indeed have been extreme but it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had it was not in nature that these things should fail in latentlyengendering an element in him which under suitable circumstances would break out from its confinement and burn all his courage up and brave as he might be it was that sort of bravery chiefly visible in some intrepid men which while generally abiding firmin the conflict with seas or winds or whales or any of the ordinaryirrational horrors of the world yet cannot withstand those more terrific because more spiritual terrors which sometimes menace you fromthe concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man but were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance the complete abasement of poor starbuck s fortitude scarce mighti have the heart to write it for it is a thing most sorrowful nay shocking to expose the fall of valor in the soul men may seem detestable as joint stock companies and nations knaves fools and murderers there may be men may have mean andmeagre faces but man in the ideal is so noble and so sparkling such a grand and glowing creature that over any ignominious blemishin him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves so far within us that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of avalor ruined man nor can piety itself at such a shameful sight completely stifle her upbraidings

craven nor valiant taking perils as they came with an indifferent air and whileengaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase toiling away calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year good humored easy and careless he presided over hiswhaleboat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner and his crew all invited guests he was as particularabout the comfortable arrangements of his part of the boat as an old stage driver is about the snugness of his box when close to the whale in the very death lock of the fight he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off handedly as awhistling tinker his hammer he would hum over his old rigadigtunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster long usage had for this stubb converted the jaws of deathinto an easy chair what he thought of death itself there is no telling whether he ever thought of it at all might be a question but if he ever did chance to cast his mindthat way after a comfortable dinner no doubt like a good sailor he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and bestir themselves there about something which he wouldfind out when he obeyed the order and not sooner what perhaps with other things made stubb such an easy going unfearing man so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in aworld full of grave peddlers all bowed to the ground with their packs what helped to bring about that almost impious good humor of his that thing must have been his pipe for like his nose his short black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face you would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunkwithout his nose as without his pipe he kept a whole row of pipesthere ready loaded stuck in a rack within easy reach of his hand and whenever he turned in he smoked them all out in succession lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter then loadingthem again to be in readiness anew for when stubb dressed instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers he put his pipeinto his mouth i say this continual smoking must have been one cause at least ofhis peculiar disposition for every one knows that this earthly air whether ashore or afloat is terribly infected with the namelessmiseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it and as in time of the cholera some people go about with acamphorated handkerchief to their mouths so likewise against allmortal tribulations stubb s tobacco smoke might have operatedas a sort of disinfecting agent the third mate was flask a native of tisbury in martha s vineyard a short stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concerning whales who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personallyand hereditarily affronted him and therefore it was a sortof point of honor with him to destroy them whenever encountered so utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvelsof their majestic bulk and mystic ways and so dead to anythinglike an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them that in his poor opinion the wondrous whale was but a speciesof magnified mouse or at least water rat requiring only a littlecircumvention and some small application of time and trouble in orderto kill and boil this ignorant unconscious fearlessness of hismade him a little waggish in the matter of whales he followedthese fish for the fun of it and a three years voyage roundcape horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time as a carpenter s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails so mankind may be similarly divided little flask was oneof the wrought ones made to clinch tight and last long they called him king post on board of the pequod because in form he could be well likened to the short square timber known by that namein arctic whalers and which by the means of many radiating sidetimbers inserted into it serves to brace the ship against the icyconcussions of those battering seas now these three mates starbuck stubb and flask were momentous men they it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the pequod sboats as headsmen in that grand order of battle in which captain ahabwould probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales these threeheadsmen were as captains of companies or being armed with theirlong keen whaling spears they were as a picked trio of lancers even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins and since in this famous fishery each mate or headsman like a gothic knight of old is always accompanied by hisboat steerer or harpooneer who in certain conjunctures provideshim with a fresh lance when the former one has been badly twisted or elbowed in the assault and moreover as there generallysubsists between the two a close intimacy and friendliness it is therefore but meet that in this place we set downwho the pequod s harpooneers were and to what headsman eachof them belonged first of all was queequeg whom starbuck the chief mate had selected for his squire but queequeg is already known next was tashtego an unmixed indian from gay head the most westerlypromontory of martha s vineyard where there still exists the lastremnant of a village of red men which has long supplied the neighboringisland of nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers in the fishery they usually go by the generic name ofgay headers tashtego s long lean sable hair his high cheek bones and black rounding eyes for an indian oriental in their largeness but antarctic in their glittering expression all this sufficientlyproclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proudwarrior hunters who in quest of the great new england moose had scoured bow in hand the aboriginal forests of the main but no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrowof the sires to look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlierpuritans and half believed this wild indian to be a son of the princeof the powers of the air tashtego was stubb the second mate s squire third among the harpooneers was daggoo a gigantic coal blacknegro savage with a lion like tread an ahasuerus to behold suspended from his ears were two golden hoops so large that the sailorscalled them ringbolts and would talk of securing the top sailhalyards to them in his youth daggoo had voluntarily shippedon board of a whaler lying in a lonely bay on his native coast and never having been anywhere in the world but in africa nantucket and the pagan harbors most frequented by the whalemen and havingnow led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the shipsof owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues and erect as a giraffe moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks there was a corporeal humility in looking up at him and a white manstanding before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress curious to tell this imperial negro ahasuerus daggoo was thesquire of little flask who looked like a chess man beside him as for the residue of the pequod s company be it said that at the present day not one in two of the many thousandmen before the mast employed in the american whale fishery are americans born though pretty nearly all the officers are herein it is the same with the american whale fishery as with theamerican army and military and merchant navies and the engineeringforces employed in the construction of the american canalsand railroads the same i say because in all these casesthe native american literally provides the brains the restof the world as generously supplying the muscles no small numberof these whaling seamen belong to the azores where the outwardbound nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crewsfrom the hardy peasants of those rocky shores in like manner the greenland whalers sailing out of hull or london put in atthe shetland islands to receive the full complement of their crew upon the passage homewards they drop them there again how it is there is no telling but islanders seem to make the best whalemen they were nearly all islanders in the pequod isolatoes too i call such not acknowledging the common continent of men but each isolato living on a separate continent of his own yet now federated along one keel what a set these isolatoes were an anacharsis clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea and all the ends of the earth accompanying old ahab inthe pequod to lay the world s grievances before that bar fromwhich not very many of them ever come back black little pip he never did oh no he went before poor alabama boy on the grim pequod s forecastle ye shall ere long see him beating his tambourine prelusive of the eternal time when sent for to the great quarter deck on high he was bid strike in with angels and beat his tambourine in glory called a coward here hailed a hero there chapter ahabfor several days after leaving nantucket nothing above hatcheswas seen of captain ahab the mates regularly relieved each otherat the watches and for aught that could be seen to the contrary they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship only theysometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously yes their supreme lord and dictator was there though hithertounseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacredretreat of the cabin every time i ascended to the deck from my watches below i instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain now in the seclusion of the sea became almost a perturbation this was strangely heightened at times by the ragged elijah sdiabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me with a subtle energy i could not have before conceived of but poorly could i withstand them much as in other moodsi was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalitiesof that outlandish prophet of the wharves but whateverit was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness to call it so which i felt yet whenever i came to look about me in the ship it seemed against all warranty to cherish such emotions for though the harpooneers with the great body of the crew were a far more barbaric heathenish and motley set than anyof the tame merchant ship companies which my previous experienceshad made me acquainted with still i ascribed this and rightlyascribed it to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wildscandinavian vocation in which i had so abandonedly embarked but it was especially the aspect of the three chief officersof the ship the mates which was most forcibly calculatedto allay these colorless misgivings and induce confidenceand cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage three better more likely sea officers and men each in hisown different way could not readily be found and they wereevery one of them americans a nantucketer a vineyarder a cape man now it being christmas when the ship shotfrom out her harbor for a space we had biting polar weather though all the time running away from it to the southward and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed gradually leaving that merciless winter and all its intolerableweather behind us it was one of those less lowering but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the waterwith a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity that as i mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch so soon as i levelled my glance towards the taffrail foreboding shivers ran over me reality outran apprehension captain ahab stood upon his quarter deck there seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him nor of the recovery from any he looked like a man cut awayfrom the stake when the fire has overrunningly wasted allthe limbs without consuming them or taking away one particlefrom their compacted aged robustness his whole high broad form seemed made of solid bronze and shaped in an unalterable mould like cellini s cast perseus threading its way out from amonghis grey hairs and continuing right down one side of his tawnyscorched face and neck till it disappeared in his clothing you saw a slender rod like mark lividly whitish it resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight lofty trunk of a great tree when the upper lightning tearinglydarts down it and without wrenching a single twig peels andgrooves out the bark from top to bottom ere running off intothe soil leaving the tree still greenly alive but branded whether that mark was born with him or whether it was the scarleft by some desperate wound no one could certainly say by some tacit consent throughout the voyage littleor no allusion was made to it especially by the mates but once tashtego s senior an old gay head indian among the crew superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty yearsold did ahab become that way branded and then it came upon him not in the fury of any mortal fray but in an elemental strifeat sea yet this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived by what a grey manxman insinuated an old sepulchral man who having never before sailed out of nantucket had neverere this laid eye upon wild ahab nevertheless the oldsea traditions the immemorial credulities popularly investedthis old manxman with preternatural powers of discernment so that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he saidthat if ever captain ahab should be tranquilly laid out which might hardly come to pass so he muttered then whoever shoulddo that last office for the dead would find a birth mark on himfrom crown to sole so powerfully did the whole grim aspect of ahab affect me and the livid brand which streaked it that for the first few momentsi hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimnesswas owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood it had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea beenfashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale s jaw aye he was dismasted off japan said the old gay head indian once but like his dismasted craft he shipped another mast withoutcoming home for it he has a quiver of em i was struck with the singular posture he maintained upon each side of the pequod s quarter deck and pretty closeto the mizzen shrouds there was an auger hole bored about halfan inch or so into the plank his bone leg steadied in that hole one arm elevated and holding by a shroud captain ahab stood erect looking straight out beyond the ship s ever pitching prow there was an infinity of firmest fortitude a determinate unsurrenderable wilfulness in the fixed and fearless forward dedication of that glance not a word he spoke nor did his officers say aught to him though by all theirminutest gestures and expressions they plainly showed the uneasy if not painful consciousness of being under a troubledmaster eye and not only that but moody stricken ahab stoodbefore them with a crucifixion in his face in all the namelessregal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe ere long from his first visit in the air he withdrew into his cabin but after that morning he was every day visible to the crew either standing in his pivot hole or seated upon an ivory stool he had or heavily walking the deck as the sky grew less gloomy indeed beganto grow a little genial he became still less and less a recluse as if when the ship had sailed from home nothing but the dead wintrybleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded and by and by it came to pass that he was almost continually in the air but as yet for all that he said or perceptibly did on the atlast sunny deck he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast but the pequod was only making a passage now not regularly cruising nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fullycompetent to so that there was little or nothing out of himself to employ or excite ahab now and thus chase away for that one interval the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow as everall clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon nevertheless ere long the warm warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant holiday weather we came to seemed gradually to charm him from his mood for as when the red cheeked dancing girls april and may trip hometo the wintry misanthropic woods even the barest ruggedest mostthunder cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts to welcome such gladhearted visitants so ahab did in the end a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air more than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look which in anyother man would have soon flowered out in a smile chapter enter ahab to him stubbsome days elapsed and ice and icebergs all astern the pequodnow went rolling through the bright quito spring which at sea almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal augustof the tropic the warmly cool clear ringing perfumed overflowing redundant days were as crystal goblets of persian sherbet heaped up flaked up with rose water snow the starred and stately nights seemedhaughty dames in jewelled velvets nursing at home in lonely pride the memory of their absent conquering earls the golden helmeted suns for sleeping man twas hard to choose between such winsome days andsuch seducing nights but all the witcheries of that unwaning weatherdid not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world inward they turned upon the soul especially when the still mildhours of eve came on then memory shot her crystals as the clear icemost forms of noiseless twilights and all these subtle agencies more and more they wrought on ahab s texture old age is always wakeful as if the longer linked with life the less man has to do with aught that looks like death among sea commanders the old greybeards will oftenestleave their berths to visit the night cloaked deck it was so with ahab only that now of late he seemed so muchto live in the open air that truly speaking his visitswere more to the cabin than from the cabin to the planks it feels like going down into one s tomb he would mutterto himself for an old captain like me to be descending thisnarrow scuttle to go to my grave dug berth so almost every twenty four hours when the watches of the nightwere set and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle the sailorsflung it not rudely down as by day but with some cautiousness dropt itto its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates when thissort of steady quietude would begin to prevail habitually the silentsteersman would watch the cabin scuttle and ere long the old manwould emerge gripping at the iron banister to help his crippled way some considering touch of humanity was in him for at times like these he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter deck because to hiswearied mates seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step that their dreams would have been of the crunching teeth of sharks but once the mood was on him too deep for common regardings and as with heavy lumber like pace he was measuring the ship fromtaffrail to mainmast stubb the old second mate came up from below and with a certain unassured deprecating humorousness hinted that ifcaptain ahab was pleased to walk the planks then no one could say nay but there might be some way of muffling the noise hinting somethingindistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow and the insertioninto it of the ivory heel ah stubb thou didst not know ahab then am i a cannon ball stubb said ahab that thou wouldstwad me that fashion but go thy ways i had forgot below to thy nightly grave where such as ye sleep between shrouds to use ye to the filling one at last down dog and kennel starting at the unforeseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenlyscornful old man stubb was speechless a moment then said excitedly i am not used to be spoken to that way sir i do but less than halflike it sir avast gritted ahab between his set teeth and violently moving away as if to avoid some passionate temptation no sir not yet said stubb emboldened i will not tamelybe called a dog sir then be called ten times a donkey and a mule and an ass and begone or i ll clear the world of thee as he said this ahab advanced upon him with such overbearingterrors in his aspect that stubb involuntarily retreated i was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it muttered stubb as he found himself descending the cabin scuttle it s very queer stop stubb somehow now i don t wellknow whether to go back and strike him or what s that down here on my knees and pray for him yes that was the thoughtcoming up in me but it would be the first time i ever did pray it s queer very queer and he s queer too aye take him foreand aft he s about the queerest old man stubb ever sailed with how he flashed at me his eyes like powder pans is he mad anyway there s something s on his mind as sure as theremust be something on a deck when it cracks he aint in hisbed now either more than three hours out of the twenty four and he don t sleep then didn t that dough boy the steward tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man s hammockclothes all rumpled and tumbled and the sheets down at the foot and the coverlid almost tied into knots and the pillow a sortof frightful hot as though a baked brick had been on it a hot old man i guess he s got what some folks ashorecall a conscience it s a kind of tic dolly row they say worse nor a toothache well well i don t know what it is but the lord keep me from catching it he s full of riddles i wonder what he goes into the after hold for every night as dough boy tells me he suspects what s that for i shouldlike to know who s made appointments with him in the hold ain t that queer now but there s no telling it s the old game here goes for a snooze damn me it s worth a fellow swhile to be born into the world if only to fall right asleep and now that i think of it that s about the first thingbabies do and that s a sort of queer too damn me but all things are queer come to think of em but that sagainst my principles think not is my eleventh commandment and sleep when you can is my twelfth so here goes again but how s that didn t he call me a dog blazes he called me tentimes a donkey and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that he might as well have kicked me and done with it maybe he did kick me and i didn t observe it i was so taken allaback with his brow somehow it flashed like a bleached bone what the devil s the matter with me i don t stand right on my legs coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out by the lord i must have been dreaming though how how how but the only way s to stash it so here goes to hammock again and in the morning i ll see how this plaguey juggling thinksover by daylight chapter the pipewhen stubb had departed ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks and then as had been usual with him of late calling a sailor ofthe watch he sent him below for his ivory stool and also his pipe lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool onthe weather side of the deck he sat and smoked in old norse times the thrones of the sea loving danish kingswere fabricated saith tradition of the tusks of the narwhale how could one look at ahab then seated on that tripod of bones without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized for a khan of the plank and a king of the sea and a great lordof leviathans was ahab some moments passed during which the thick vapor camefrom his mouth in quick and constant puffs which blew backagain into his face how now he soliloquized at last withdrawing the tube this smoking no longer soothes oh my pipe hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone here have i been unconsciously toiling not pleasuring aye and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while to windward and with such nervous whiffs as if like the dying whale my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble what business have i with this pipe this thing that ismeant for sereneness to send up mild white vapors amongmild white hairs not among torn iron grey locks like mine i ll smoke no more he tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea the fire hissedin the waves the same instant the ship shot by the bubblethe sinking pipe made with slouched hat ahab lurchinglypaced the planks chapter queen mabnext morning stubb accosted flask such a queer dream king post i never had you know the old man sivory leg well i dreamed he kicked me with it and when i triedto kick back upon my soul my little man i kicked my leg right off and then presto ahab seemed a pyramid and i like a blazing fool kept kicking at it but what was still more curious flask you knowhow curious all dreams are through all this rage that i was in i somehow seemed to be thinking to myself that after all it was not much of an insult that kick from ahab why thinks i what s the row it s not a real leg only a false one and there s a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump that s what makes a blow from the hand flask fifty timesmore savage to bear than a blow from a cane the living member that makes the living insult my little man and thinks i to myselfall the while mind while i was stubbing my silly toes againstthat cursed pyramid so confoundedly contradictory was it all all the while i say i was thinking to myself what s his leg now but a cane a whale bone cane yes thinks i it was onlya playful cudgelling in fact only a whaleboning that he gave me not a base kick besides thinks i look at it once why the endof it the foot part what a small sort of end it is whereas if abroad footed farmer kicked me there s a devilish broad insult but this insult is whittled down to a point only but now comesthe greatest joke of the dream flask while i was battering awayat the pyramid a sort of badger haired old merman with a humpon his back takes me by the shoulders and slews me round what are you bout says he slid man but i was frightened such a phiz but somehow next moment i was over the fright what am i about says i at last and what business is that of yours i should like to know mr humpback do you want a kick by the lord flask i had no sooner said that than he turnedround his stern to me bent over and dragging up a lot of seaweedhe had for a clout what do you think i saw why thunder alive man his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes with the points out says i on second thought i guess i won t kick you old fellow wise stubb said he wise stubb and kept muttering it allthe time a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag seeing he wasn t going to stop saying over his wise stubb wise stubb i thought i might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again but i had only just lifted my foot for it when he roared out stop that kicking halloa says i what s the matter now old fellow look ye here says he let s argue the insult captain ahab kicked ye didn t he yes he did says i right hereit was very good says he he used his ivory leg didn t he yes he did says i well then says he wise stubb what haveyou to complain of didn t he kick with right good will it wasn ta common pitch pine leg he kicked with was it no you were kickedby a great man and with a beautiful ivory leg stubb it s an honor i consider it an honor listen wise stubb in old englandthe greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen and made garter knights of but be your boast stubb that ye werekicked by old ahab and made a wise man of remember what i say be kicked by him account his kicks honors and on no account kick back for you can t help yourself wise stubb don t you see that pyramid with that he all of a sudden seemed somehow in some queer fashion to swim off into the air i snored rolled over and there i wasin my hammock now what do you think of that dream flask i don t know it seems a sort of foolish to me tho may be may be but it s made a wise man of me flask d ye see ahabstanding there sideways looking over the stern well the best thingyou can do flask is to let the old man alone never speak to him whatever he says halloa what s that he shouts hark mast head there look sharp all of ye there are whales hereabouts if ye see a white one split your lungs for him what do you think of that now flask ain t there a smalldrop of something queer about that eh a white whale did yemark that man look ye there s something special in the wind stand by for it flask ahab has that that s bloody on his mind but mum he comes this way chapter cetologyalready we are boldly launched upon the deep but soon weshall be lost in its unshored harborless immensities ere that come to pass ere the pequod s weedy hull rollsside by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almostindispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the morespecial leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sortswhich are to follow it is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera that i would now fain put before you yet is it no easy task the classification of the constituents of a chaos nothing lessis here essayed listen to what the best and latest authoritieshave laid down no branch of zoology is so much involved as that which isentitled cetology says captain scoresby a d it is not my intention were it in my power to enter into the inquiryas to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups andfamilies utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal sperm whale says surgeon beale a d unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea a field strewn with thorns all these incomplete indicationsbut serve to torture us naturalists thus speak of the whale the great cuvier and john hunter and lesson those lights of zoology and anatomy nevertheless though of realknowledge there be little yet of books there are a plenty and so in some small degree with cetology or the science of whales many are the men small and great old and new landsmen and seamen who have at large or in little written of the whale run over a few the authors of the bible aristotle pliny aldrovandi sir thomas browne gesner ray linnaeus rondeletius willoughby green artedi sibbald brisson marten lacepede bonneterre desmarest baron cuvier frederickcuvier john hunter owen scoresby beale bennett j ross browne the author of miriam coffin olmstead and the rev t

but one of them was a real professional harpooneerand whaleman i mean captain scoresby on the separate subjectof the greenland or right whale he is the best existing authority but scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale compared with which the greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning and here be it said that the greenland whale is an usurper uponthe throne of the seas he is not even by any means the largestof the whales yet owing to the long priority of his claims and the profound ignorance which till some seventy years back invested the then fabulous and utterly unknown sperm whale and whichignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientificretreats and whale ports this usurpation has been every way complete reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the greatpoets of past days will satisfy you that the greenland whale without one rival was to them the monarch of the seas but the timehas at last come for a new proclamation this is charing cross hear ye good people all the greenland whale is deposed the great sperm whale now reigneth there are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the livingsperm whale before you and at the same time in the remotest degreesucceed in the attempt those books are beale s and bennett s both in their time surgeons to the english south sea whale ships and both exact and reliable men the original matter touchingthe sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small but so far as it goes it is of excellent quality though mostlyconfined to scientific description as yet however the sperm whale scientific or poetic lives not complete in any literature far above all other hunted whales his is an unwritten life now the various species of whales need some sort of popularcomprehensive classification if only an easy outline one forthe present hereafter to be filled in all outward its departmentsby subsequent laborers as no better man advances to takethis matter in hand i hereupon offer my own poor endeavors i promise nothing complete because any human thing supposedto be complete must for that very reason infallibly be faulty i shall not pretend to a minute anatomical descriptionof the various species or in this space at least to much of any description my object here is simplyto project the draught of a systematization of cetology i am the architect not the builder but it is a ponderous task no ordinary letter sorter in the post officeis equal to it to grope down into the bottom of the sea after them to have one s hands among the unspeakable foundations ribs and very pelvis of the world this is a fearful thing what am i that i should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan the awful tauntings in job might well appal me will he the leviathan make a covenant with thee behold the hope of him is vain but i have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans i have had to do with whales with these visible hands i am in earnest and i will try there are some preliminaries to settle first the uncertain unsettled condition of this scienceof cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whethera whale be a fish in his system of nature a d linnaeus declares i hereby separate the whales from the fish but of my own knowledge i know that down to the year sharks and shad alewives and herring against linnaeus sexpress edict were still found dividing the possessionof the same seas with the leviathan the grounds upon which linnaeus would fain have banishedthe whales from the waters he states as follows on accountof their warm bilocular heart their lungs their movable eyelids their hollow ears penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem and finally ex lege naturae jure meritoque i submitted allthis to my friends simeon macey and charley coffin of nantucket both messmates of mine in a certain voyage and they united inthe opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient charley profanely hinted they were humbug be it known that waiving all argument i take the good old fashionedground that the whale is a fish and call upon holy jonah to back me this fundamental thing settled the next point is in what internalrespect does the whale differ from other fish above linnaeus has givenyou those items but in brief they are these lungs and warm blood whereas all other fish are lungless and cold blooded next how shall we define the whale by his obvious externals so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come to be short then a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail there you have him however contracted that definition is the resultof expanded meditation a walrus spouts much like a whale but the walrus is not a fish because he is amphibious but the last term of the definition is still more cogent as coupled with the first almost any one must have noticedthat all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat but a vertical or up and down tail whereas among spouting fishthe tail though it may be similarly shaped invariably assumesa horizontal position by the above definition of what a whale is i do by no means excludefrom the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identifiedwith the whale by the best informed nantucketers nor on the other hand link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien hence all the smaller spouting and horizontal tailed fish must be includedin this ground plan of cetology now then come the grand divisionsof the entire whale host i am aware that down to the present time the fish styledlamatins and dugongs pig fish and sow fish of the coffinsof nantucket are included by many naturalists among the whales but as these pig fish are a noisy contemptible set mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers and feeding on wet hay and especially as they do not spout i deny their credentialsas whales and have presented them with their passports to quitthe kingdom of cetology first according to magnitude i divide the whales into three primary books subdivisible into chapters and these shall comprehend them all both small and large i the folio whale ii the octavo whale iii the duodecimo whale as the type of the folio i present the sperm whale of the octavo the grampus of the duodecimo the porpoise folios among these i here include the following chapters i the sperm whale ii the right whale iii the fin back whale iv the humpbacked whale v the razor back whale vi the sulphur bottom whale book i folio chapter i sperm whale this whale among the english of old vaguely known as the trumpa whale andthe physeter whale and the anvil headed whale is the presentcachalot of the french and the pottsfich of the germans and the macrocephalus of the long words he is without doubt the largest inhabitant of the globe the most formidable of allwhales to encounter the most majestic in aspect and lastly by far the most valuable in commerce he being the only creaturefrom which that valuable substance spermaceti is obtained all his peculiarities will in many other places be enlarged upon it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do philologically considered it is absurd some centuries ago when the sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his ownproper individuality and when his oil was only accidentallyobtained from the stranded fish in those days spermaceti it would seem was popularly supposed to be derived froma creature identical with the one then known in england asthe greenland or right whale it was the idea also that thissame spermaceti was that quickening humor of the greenland whalewhich the first syllable of the word literally expresses in those times also spermaceti was exceedingly scarce not being used for light but only as an ointment and medicament it was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buyan ounce of rhubarb when as i opine in the course of time the true nature of spermaceti became known its original namewas still retained by the dealers no doubt to enhance itsvalue by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity and so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowedupon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived book i folio chapter ii right whale in one respect thisis the most venerable of the leviathans being the one firstregularly hunted by man it yields the article commonly knownas whalebone or baleen and the oil specially known as whale oil an inferior article in commerce among the fishermen he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles the whale the greenland whale the black whale the great whale the true whale the right whale there is a deal of obscurityconcerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptized what then is the whale which i include in the second species ofmy folios it is the great mysticetus of the english naturalists the greenland whale of the english whalemen the baliene ordinaireof the french whalemen the growlands walfish of the swedes it isthe whale which for more than two centuries past has been huntedby the dutch and english in the arctic seas it is the whalewhich the american fishermen have long pursued in the indian ocean on the brazil banks on the nor west coast and various other partsof the world designated by them right whale cruising grounds some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whaleof the english and the right whale of the americans but theyprecisely agree in all their grand features nor has there yetbeen presented a single determinate fact upon which to grounda radical distinction it is by endless subdivisions basedupon the most inconclusive differences that some departmentsof natural history become so repellingly intricate the right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length with reference to elucidating the sperm whale book i folio chapter iii fin back under this head i reckona monster which by the various names of fin back tall spout and long john has been seen almost in every sea and is commonlythe whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengerscrossing the atlantic in the new york packet tracks inthe length he attains and in his baleen the fin backresembles the right whale but is of a less portly girth and a lighter color approaching to olive his great lips presenta cable like aspect formed by the intertwisting slanting foldsof large wrinkles his grand distinguishing feature the fin from which he derives his name is often a conspicuous object this fin is some three or four feet long growing verticallyfrom the hinder part of the back of an angular shape and with a very sharp pointed end even if not the slightestother part of the creature be visible this isolated fin will at times be seen plainly projecting from the surface when the sea is moderately calm and slightly marked withspherical ripples and this gnomon like fin stands up and castsshadows upon the wrinkled surface it may well be supposedthat the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial with its style and wavy hour lines graved on it on that ahaz dialthe shadow often goes back the fin back is not gregarious he seems a whale hater as some men are man haters very shy always going solitary unexpectedly rising to the surfacein the remotest and most sullen waters his straight andsingle lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upona barren plain gifted with such wondrous power and velocityin swimming as to defy all present pursuit from man this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable cainof his race bearing for his mark that style upon his back from having the baleen in his mouth the fin back is sometimesincluded with the right whale among a theoretic speciesdenominated whalebone whales that is whales with baleen of these so called whalebone whales there would seem to beseveral varieties most of which however are little known broad nosed whales and beaked whales pike headed whales bunched whales under jawed whales and rostrated whales are the fisherman s names for a few sorts in connexion with this appellative of whalebone whales it is of great importance to mention that however such a nomenclaturemay be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan founded upon either his baleen or hump or fin or teeth notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviouslyseem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular systemof cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions which the whale in his kinds presents how then the baleen hump back fin and teeth these are things whosepeculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales without any regard to what may be the nature of their structurein other and more essential particulars thus the sperm whale andthe humpbacked whale each has a hump but there the similitude ceases then this same humpbacked whale and the greenland whale each of these has baleen but there again the similitude ceases and it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned in various sorts of whales they form such irregular combinations or in the case of any one of them detached such an irregular isolation as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis on this rock every one of the whale naturalists has split but it may possibly be conceived that in the internal partsof the whale in his anatomy there at least we shallbe able to hit the right classification nay what thing for example is there in the greenland whale s anatomy morestriking than his baleen yet we have seen that by his baleenit is impossible correctly to classify the greenland whale and if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as availableto the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated what then remains nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily in their entire liberal volume and boldly sort them that way and this is the bibliographical system here adopted and it is the only one that can possibly succeed for it aloneis practicable to proceed book i folio chapter iv hump back this whale is often seenon the northern american coast he has been frequently captured there and towed into harbor he has a great pack on him like a peddler or you might call him the elephant and castle whale at any rate the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one his oil is not very valuable he has baleen he is the most gamesomeand light hearted of all the whales making more gay foam and whitewater generally than any other of them book i folio chapter v razor back of this whalelittle is known but his name i have seen him at a distanceoff cape horn of a retiring nature he eludes both huntersand philosophers though no coward he has never yet shown anypart of him but his back which rises in a long sharp ridge let him go i know little more of him nor does anybody else book i folio chapter vi sulphur bottom another retiringgentleman with a brimstone belly doubtless got by scraping alongthe tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings he is seldom seen at least i have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance he is never chased he would run away with rope walks of line prodigies are told of him adieu sulphur bottom i can say nothingmore that is true of ye nor can the oldest nantucketer thus ends book i folio and now begins book ii octavo octavoes these embrace the whales of middling magnitude among which at present may be numbered i the grampus ii theblack fish iii the narwhale iv the thrasher v the killer why this book of whales is not denominated the quarto is very plain because while the whales of this order though smaller than thoseof the former order nevertheless retain a proportionate likenessto them in figure yet the bookbinder s quarto volume in itsdimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the folio volume but the octavo volume does book ii octavo chapter i grampus though this fish whose loud sonorous breathing or rather blowing has furnished a proverb to landsmen is so well known a denizenof the deep yet is he not popularly classed among whales but possessing all the grand distinctive features ofthe leviathan most naturalists have recognised him for one he is of moderate octavo size varying from fifteen to twenty fivefeet in length and of corresponding dimensions round the waist he swims in herds he is never regularly hunted though hisoil is considerable in quantity and pretty good for light by some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitoryof the advance of the great sperm whale book ii octavo chapter ii black fish i give the popularfishermen s names for all these fish for generally they are the best where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive i shall say so and suggest another i do so now touching the black fish so called because blackness is the rule among almostall whales so call him the hyena whale if you please his voracity is well known and from the circumstancethat the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards he carries an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face this whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length he is found in almost all latitudes he has a peculiar wayof showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming which lookssomething like a roman nose when not more profitably employed the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the hyena whale to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment as some frugal housekeepers in the absence of company and quitealone by themselves burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax though their blubber is very thin some of these whales willyield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil book ii octavo chapter iii narwhale that is nostril whale another instance of a curiously named whale so named i supposefrom his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose the creature is some sixteen feet in length while its horn averagesfive feet though some exceed ten and even attain to fifteen feet strictly speaking this horn is but a lengthened tusk growing outfrom the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal but it is only found on the sinister side which has an ill effect giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsyleft handed man what precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers it would be hard to say it does not seem to be used like the bladeof the sword fish and bill fish though some sailors tell me thatthe narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom ofthe sea for food charley coffin said it was used for an ice piercer for the narwhale rising to the surface of the polar sea and findingit sheeted with ice thrusts his horn up and so breaks through but you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct my own opinion is that however this one sided horn may reallybe used by the narwhale however that may be it would certainlybe very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets the narwhale i have heard called the tusked whale the horned whale and the unicorn whale he is certainly a curious example of theunicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature from certain cloistered old authors i have gathered that this samesea unicorn s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidoteagainst poison and as such preparations of it brought immense prices it was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies the sameway that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity black letter tells me that sir martin frobisher on his return from thatvoyage when queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him froma window of greenwich palace as his bold ship sailed down the thames when sir martin returned from that voyage saith black letter on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long hornof the narwhale which for a long period after hung in the castleat windsor an irish author avers that the earl of leicester on bended knees did likewise present to her highness another horn pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature the narwhale has a very picturesque leopard like look being of amilk white ground color dotted with round and oblong spots of black his oil is very superior clear and fine but there is little of it and he is seldom hunted he is mostly found in the circumpolar seas book ii octavo chapter iv killer of this whalelittle is precisely known to the nantucketer and nothingat all to the professed naturalists from what i have seenof him at a distance i should say that he was about the bignessof a grampus he is very savage a sort of feegee fish he sometimes takes the great folio whales by the lip and hangsthere like a leech till the mighty brute is worried to death the killer is never hunted i never heard what sort of oil he has exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale on the ground of its indistinctness for we are all killers on land and on sea bonapartes and sharks included book ii octavo chapter v thrasher this gentleman is famous forhis tail which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes he mounts thefolio whale s back and as he swims he works his passage by flogging him as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process still less is known of the thrasher than of the killer both are outlaws even in the lawless seas thus ends book ii octavo and begins book iii duodecimo duodecimoes these include the smaller whales i the huzza porpoise ii the algerine porpoise iii the mealy mouthed porpoise to those who have not chanced specially to study the subject it may possibly seem strange that fishes not commonly exceedingfour or five feet should be marshalled among whales a word which in the popular sense always conveys an idea of hugeness but the creatures set down above as duodecimoes are infallibly whales by the terms of my definition of what a whale is i e a spouting fish with a horizontal tail book iii duodecimo chapter huzza porpoise this isthe common porpoise found almost all over the globe the name isof my own bestowal for there are more than one sort of porpoises and something must be done to distinguish them i call him thus because he always swims in hilarious shoals which upon the broad seakeep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a fourth of july crowd their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner full of fine spirits they invariably come from the breezy billowsto windward they are the lads that always live before the wind they are accounted a lucky omen if you yourself can withstandthree cheers at beholding these vivacious fish then heaven help ye the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye a well fed plumphuzza porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil but the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws isexceedingly valuable it is in request among jewellers and watchmakers sailors put it on their hones porpoise meat is good eating you know it may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts indeed his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible but the next time you have a chance watch him and you will thensee the great sperm whale himself in miniature book iii duodecimo chapter ii algerine porpoise a pirate very savage he is only found i think in the pacific he is somewhatlarger than the huzza porpoise but much of the same general make provoke him and he will buckle to a shark i have lowered for himmany times but never yet saw him captured book iii duodecimo chapter iii mealy mouthed porpoise thelargest kind of porpoise and only found in the pacific so faras it is known the only english name by which he has hithertobeen designated is that of the fisher right whale porpoise from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity ofthat folio in shape he differs in some degree from the huzza porpoise being of a less rotund and jolly girth indeed he is of quitea neat and gentleman like figure he has no fins on his back most other porpoises have he has a lovely tail and sentimentalindian eyes of a hazel hue but his mealy mouth spoils all though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable yet a boundary line distinct as the mark in a ship s hull called the bright waist that line streaks him from stemto stern with two separate colors black above and white below the white comprises part of his head and the whole of his mouth which makes him look as if he had just escaped from afelonious visit to a meal bag a most mean and mealy aspect his oil is much like that of the common porpoise beyond the duodecimo this system does not proceed inasmuch as the porpoise is the smallest of the whales above you have all the leviathans of note but there are a rabbleof uncertain fugitive half fabulous whales which as anamerican whaleman i know by reputation but not personally i shall enumerate them by their fore castle appellations for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators who may complete what i have here but begun if any ofthe following whales shall hereafter be caught and marked then he can readily be incorporated into this system according to his folio octavo or duodecimo magnitude the bottle nose whale the junk whale the pudding headed whale the cape whale the leading whale the cannon whale the scragg whale the coppered whale the elephant whale the iceberg whale the quog whale the blue whale c from icelandic dutch and old english authorities there might be quoted other listsof uncertain whales blessed with all manner of uncouth names but i omit them as altogether obsolete and can hardly helpsuspecting them for mere sounds full of leviathanism but signifying nothing finally it was stated at the outset that this system would notbe here and at once perfected you cannot but plainly see that ihave kept my word but i now leave my cetological system standingthus unfinished even as the great cathedral of cologne was left with the cranes still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower for small erections may be finished by their first architects grand ones true ones ever leave the copestone to posterity god keep me from ever completing anything this wholebook is but a draught nay but the draught of a draught oh time strength cash and patience chapter the specksynderconcerning the officers of the whale craft this seems as good a placeas any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship board arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale fleet the large importance attached to the harpooneer s vocation isevinced by the fact that originally in the old dutch fishery two centuries and more ago the command of a whale ship was notwholly lodged in the person now called the captain but was dividedbetween him and an officer called the specksynder literally thisword means fat cutter usage however in time made it equivalentto chief harpooneer in those days the captain s authority wasrestricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel while over the whale hunting department and all its concerns the specksynder or chief harpooneer reigned supreme in the british greenland fishery under the corrupted titleof specksioneer this old dutch official is still retained but his former dignity is sadly abridged at present he ranks simplyas senior harpooneer and as such is but one of the captain smore inferior subalterns nevertheless as upon the good conductof the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends and since in the american fishery he is not only an importantofficer in the boat but under certain circumstances night watcheson a whaling ground the command of the ship s deck is also his therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior though always by them familiarly regarded as their social equal now the grand distinction drawn between officer and manat sea is this the first lives aft the last forward hence in whale ships and merchantmen alike the mates have theirquarters with the captain and so too in most of the americanwhalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship that is to say they take their meals in the captain s cabin and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it though the long period of a southern whaling voyage by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man the peculiar perils of it and the community of interestprevailing among a company all of whom high or low depend fortheir profits not upon fixed wages but upon their common luck together with their common vigilance intrepidity and hard work though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a lessrigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally yet never mindhow much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may in some primitive instances live together for all that the punctilious externals at least of the quarter deckare seldom materially relaxed and in no instance done away indeed many are the nantucket ships in which you will seethe skipper parading his quarter deck with an elated grandeurnot surpassed in any military navy nay extorting almostas much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple and not the shabbiest of pilot cloth and though of all men the moody captain of the pequodwas the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption and though the only homage he ever exacted was implicit instantaneous obedience though he required no man to removethe shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter deck and though there were times when owing to peculiar circumstancesconnected with events hereafter to be detailed he addressedthem in unusual terms whether of condescension or in terrorem or otherwise yet even captain ahab was by no means unobservantof the paramount forms and usages of the sea nor perhaps will it fail to be eventually perceived that behindthose forms and usages as it were he sometimes masked himself incidentally making use of them for other and more privateends than they were legitimately intended to subserve that certain sultanism of his brain which had otherwise in agood degree remained unmanifested through those forms that samesultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship for be a man s intellectual superiority what it will it cannever assume the practical available supremacy over other men without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments always in themselves more or less paltry and base this it is that for ever keeps god s true princes of the empirefrom the world s hustings and leaves the highest honors that thisair can give to those men who become famous more through theirinfinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the divine inert than through their undoubted superiority over the dead levelof the mass such large virtue lurks in these small things whenextreme political superstitions invest them that in some royalinstances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency but when as in the case of nicholas the czar the ringed crownof geographical empire encircles an imperial brain then the plebeianherds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization nor will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitablenessin its fullest sweep and direct swing ever forget a hint incidentally so important in his art as the one now alluded to but ahab my captain still moves before me in all his nantucketgrimness and shagginess and in this episode touching emperorsand kings i must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor oldwhale hunter like him and therefore all outward majestical trappingsand housings are denied me oh ahab what shall be grand in thee it must needs be plucked at from the skies and dived for in the deep and featured in the unbodied air chapter the cabin tableit is noon and dough boy the steward thrusting his pale loaf of breadface from the cabin scuttle announces dinner to his lord and master who sitting in the lee quarter boat has just been taking an observationof the sun and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth medallion shaped tablet reserved for that daily purpose on the upperpart of his ivory leg from his complete inattention to the tidings you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial but presently catching hold of the mizen shrouds he swings himself to the deck and in an even unexhilarated voice saying dinner mr starbuck disappears into the cabin when the last echo of his sultan s step has died away and starbuck the first emir has every reason to suppose that he is seated then starbuck rouses from his quietude takes a few turns alongthe planks and after a grave peep into the binnacle says with sometouch of pleasantness dinner mr stubb and descends the scuttle the second emir lounges about the rigging awhile and then slightlyshaking the main brace to see whether it will be all right with thatimportant rope he likewise takes up the old burden and with a rapid dinner mr flask follows after his predecessors but the third emir now seeing himself all alone on the quarter deck seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tipping allsorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions and kicking offhis shoes he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpiperight over the grand turk s head and then by a dexterous sleight pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf he goes downrollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck reversing all other processions by bringing up the rear with music but ere stepping into the cabin doorway below he pauses ships a new face altogether and then independent hilarious littleflask enters king ahab s presence in the character of abjectus or the slave it is not the least among the strange things bred by the intenseartificialness of sea usages that while in the open air of the decksome officers will upon provocation bear themselves boldlyand defyingly enough towards their commander yet ten to one let those very officers the next moment go down to theircustomary dinner in that same commander s cabin and straightwaytheir inoffensive not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him as he sits at the head of the table this is marvellous sometimes most comical wherefore this difference a problem perhaps not to have been belshazzar king of babylon and to have been belshazzar not haughtily but courteously therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur but he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presidesover his own private dinner table of invited guests that man sunchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time that man s royalty of state transcends belshazzar s for belshazzarwas not the greatest who has but once dined his friends has tastedwhat it is to be caesar it is a witchery of social czarshipwhich there is no withstanding now if to this considerationyou super add the official supremacy of a ship master then by inference you will derive the cause of that peculiarityof sea life just mentioned over his ivory inlaid table ahab presided like a mute maned sea lionon the white coral beach surrounded by his war like but stilldeferential cubs in his own proper turn each officer waitedto be served they were as little children before ahab and yet in ahab there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance with one mind their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man s knife as he carved the chief dish before him i do not suppose that for theworld they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation even upon so neutral a topic as the weather no and when reachingout his knife and fork between which the slice of beef was locked ahab thereby motioned starbuck s plate towards him the matereceived his meat as though receiving alms and cut it tenderly and a little started if perchance the knife grazed against the plate and chewed it noiselessly and swallowed it not without circumspection for like the coronation banquet at frankfort where the german emperorprofoundly dines with the seven imperial electors so these cabinmeals were somehow solemn meals eaten in awful silence and yet attable old ahab forbade not conversation only he himself was dumb what a relief it was to choking stubb when a rat made a suddenracket in the hold below and poor little flask he wasthe youngest son and little boy of this weary family party his were the shin bones of the saline beef his would have beenthe drumsticks for flask to have presumed to help himself this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree had he helped himself at that table doubtless never more wouldhe have been able to hold his head up in this honest world nevertheless strange to say ahab never forbade him and had flaskhelped himself the chances were ahab had never so much as noticed it least of all did flask presume to help himself to butter whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him on account of its clotting his clear sunny complexion or whetherhe deemed that on so long a voyage in such marketless waters butter was at a premium and therefore was not for him a subaltern however it was flask alas was a butterless man another thing flask was the last person down at the dinner and flask is the first man up consider for hereby flask sdinner was badly jammed in point of time starbuck and stubbboth had the start of him and yet they also have the privilegeof lounging in the rear if stubb even who is but a peg higherthan flask happens to have but a small appetite and soon showssymptoms of concluding his repast then flask must bestir himself he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day for itis against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck therefore it was that flask once admitted in private that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwisethan hungry more or less for what he ate did not so much relievehis hunger as keep it immortal in him peace and satisfaction thought flask have for ever departed from my stomach i am an officer but how i wish i could fist a bit of old fashionedbeef in the fore castle as i used to when i was before the mast there s the fruits of promotion now there s the vanity of glory there s the insanity of life besides if it were so thatany mere sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flaskin flask s official capacity all that sailor had to do in order to obtain ample vengeance was to go aft at dinnertime and get a peep at flask through the cabin sky light sittingsilly and dumfoundered before awful ahab now ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the firsttable in the pequod s cabin after their departure taking placein inverted order to their arrival the canvas cloth was cleared or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward and then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast they beingits residuary legatees they made a sort of temporary servants hall of the high and mighty cabin in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraintand nameless invisible domineerings of the captain s table was the entire care free license and ease the almost franticdemocracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers while their masters the mates seemed afraid of the soundof the hinges of their own jaws the harpooneers chewedtheir food with such a relish that there was a report to it they dined like lords they filled their bellies like indianships all day loading with spices such portentous appetiteshad queequeg and tashtego that to fill out the vacancies madeby the previous repast often the pale dough boy was fain to bringon a great baron of salt junk seemingly quarried out of the solid ox and if he were not lively about it if he did not go with animble hop skip and jump then tashtego had an ungentlemanlyway of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back harpoon wise and once daggoo seized with a sudden humor assisted dough boy s memory by snatching him up bodily and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher while tashtego knife in hand began laying out the circlepreliminary to scalping him he was naturally a very nervous shuddering sort of little fellow this bread faced steward the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse and what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages dough boy s whole life was one continual lip quiver commonly after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door till all was over it was a sight to see queequeg seated over against tashtego opposing his filed teeth to the indian s crosswise to them daggoo seated on the floor for a bench would have broughthis hearse plumed head to the low carlines at every motionof his colossal limbs making the low cabin framework to shake as when an african elephant goes passenger in a ship but for all this the great negro was wonderfully abstemious not to say dainty it seemed hardly possible that by suchcomparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitalitydiffused through so broad baronial and superb a person but doubtless this noble savage fed strong and drank deepof the abounding element of air and through his dilatednostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds not by beef or by bread are giants made or nourished but queequeg he had a mortal barbaric smack of the lip in eating an ugly sound enough so much so that the trembling dough boyalmost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in hisown lean arms and when he would hear tashtego singing outfor him to produce himself that his bones might be picked the simple witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanginground him in the pantry by his sudden fits of the palsy nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets for their lances and other weapons and with which whetstones at dinner they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poordough boy how could he forget that in his island days queequeg for one must certainly have been guilty of some murderous convivial indiscretion alas dough boy hard fares the white waiterwho waits upon cannibals not a napkin should he carry on his arm but a buckler in good time though to his great delight the three salt sea warriors would rise and depart to his credulous fable mongering ears all their martial bones jingling in themat every step like moorish scimetars in scabbards but though these barbarians dined in the cabin and nominallylived there still being anything but sedentary in their habits they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes and justbefore sleeping time when they passed through it to theirown peculiar quarters in this one matter ahab seemed no exception to most americanwhale captains who as a set rather incline to the opinionthat by rights the ship s cabin belongs to them and that it is bycourtesy alone that anybody else is at any time permitted there so that in real truth the mates and harpooneers of the pequod mightmore properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it for when they did enter it it was something as a streetdoorenters a house turning inwards for a moment only to be turnedout the next and as a permanent thing residing in the open air nor did they lose much hereby in the cabin was no companionship socially ahab was inaccessible though nominally includedin the census of christendom he was still an alien to it he lived in the world as the last of the grisly bears livedin settled missouri and as when spring and summer had departed that wild logan of the woods burying himself in the hollow of a tree lived out the winter there sucking his own paws so in his inclement howling old age ahab s soul shut up in the caved trunk of his body there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom chapter the mast headit was during the more pleasant weather that in due rotationwith the other seamen my first mast head came round in most american whalemen the mast heads are mannedalmost simultaneously with the vessel s leaving her port even though she may have fifteen thousand miles and more to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground and if after a three four or five years voyage she is drawing nighhome with anything empty in her say an empty vial even then her mast heads are kept manned to the last and not tillher skysail poles sail in among the spires of the port does shealtogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more now as the business of standing mast heads ashore or afloat is a veryancient and interesting one let us in some measure expatiate here i take it that the earliest standers of mast heads were theold egyptians because in all my researches i find none prior to them for though their progenitors the builders of babel must doubtless by their tower have intended to rear the loftiest mast head inall asia or africa either yet ere the final truck was put to it as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone bythe board in the dread gale of god s wrath therefore we cannotgive these babel builders priority over the egyptians and thatthe egyptians were a nation of mast head standers is anassertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stairlike formationof all four sides of those edifices whereby with prodigious longupliftings of their legs those old astronomers were wont to mountto the apex and sing out for new stars even as the look outs of amodern ship sing out for a sail or a whale just bearing in sight in saint stylites the famous christian hermit of old times who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the wholelatter portion of his life on its summit hoisting his food fromthe ground with a tackle in him we have a remarkable instanceof a dauntless stander of mast heads who was not to be driven fromhis place by fogs or frosts rain hail or sleet but valiantlyfacing everything out to the last literally died at his post of modern standers of mast heads we have but a lifeless set mere stone iron and bronze men who though well capable of facingout a stiff gale are still entirely incompetent to the businessof singing out upon discovering any strange sight there is napoleon who upon the top of the column of vendome stands with arms folded some one hundred and fifty feet in the air careless now who rulesthe decks below whether louis philippe louis blanc or louisthe devil great washington too stands high aloft on his toweringmain mast in baltimore and like one of hercules pillars his columnmarks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go admiral nelson also on a capstan of gun metal stands hismast head in trafalgar square and even when most obscured by thatlondon smoke token is yet given that a hidden hero is there for where there is smoke must be fire but neither great washington nor napoleon nor nelson will answer a single hail from below however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracteddecks upon which they gaze however it may be surmised that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast head standersof the land with those of the sea but that in truth it is not so is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy the sole historianof nantucket stands accountable the worthy obed tells us that inthe early times of the whale fishery ere ships were regularly launched inpursuit of the game the people of that island erected lofty spars alongthe seacoast to which the look outs ascended by means of nailed cleats something as fowls go upstairs in a hen house a few years ago this sameplan was adopted by the bay whalemen of new zealand who upon descryingthe game gave notice to the ready manned boats nigh the beach but this custom has now become obsolete turn we then to the one propermast head that of a whale ship at sea the three mast heads are keptmanned from sun rise to sun set the seamen taking their regular turns as at the helm and relieving each other every two hours in the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasantthe mast head nay to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful there you stand a hundred feet above the silent decks striding alongthe deep as if the masts were gigantic stilts while beneath youand between your legs as it were swim the hugest monsters of the sea even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous colossus atold rhodes there you stand lost in the infinite series of the sea with nothing ruffled but the waves the tranced ship indolently rolls the drowsy trade winds blow everything resolves you into languor for the most part in this tropic whaling life a sublime uneventfulnessinvests you you hear no news read no gazettes extras with startlingaccounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements you hear of no domestic afflictions bankrupt securities fall of stocks are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks and your bill of fare is immutable in one of those southern whalesmen on a long three or four years voyage as often happens the sum of the various hours youspend at the mast head would amount to several entire months and it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devoteso considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to acosy inhabitiveness or adapted to breed a comfortable localnessof feeling such as pertains to a bed a hammock a hearse a sentry box a pulpit a coach or any other of those smalland snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves your most usual point of perch is the head of the t gallant mast where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks almost peculiar to whalemen called the t gallant crosstrees here tossed about by the sea the beginner feels aboutas cosy as he would standing on a bull s horns to be sure in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you in the shape of a watch coat but properly speaking the thickestwatch coat is no more of a house than the unclad body for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle and cannot freely move about in it nor even move out of it without running great risk of perishing like an ignorant pilgrimcrossing the snowy alps in winter so a watch coat is not so muchof a house as it is a mere envelope or additional skin encasing you you cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body and no more can you make a convenience closet of your watch coat concerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mast headsof a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable littletents or pulpits called crow s nests in which the look outsof a greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weatherof the frozen seas in the fireside narrative of captain sleet entitled a voyage among the icebergs in quest of the greenland whale and incidentally for the re discovery of the lost icelandic coloniesof old greenland in this admirable volume all standersof mast heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantialaccount of the then recently invented crow s nest of the glacier which was the name of captain sleet s good craft he called it the sleet s crow s nest in honor of himself he being the original inventor and patentee and free from allridiculous false delicacy and holding that if we call our ownchildren after our own names we fathers being the originalinventors and patentees so likewise should we denominateafter ourselves any other apparatus we may beget in shape the sleet s crow s nest is something like a large tierce or pipe it is open above however where it is furnished with a movablesidescreen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale being fixed on the summit of the mast you ascend into itthrough a little trap hatch in the bottom on the after side or side next the stern of the ship is a comfortable seat with a locker underneath for umbrellas comforters and coats in front is a leather rack in which to keep your speakingtrumpet pipe telescope and other nautical conveniences when captain sleet in person stood his mast head in thiscrow s nest of his he tells us that he always had a rifle with him also fixed in the rack together with a powder flask and shot for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales or vagrantsea unicorns infesting those waters for you cannot successfullyshoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing now it was plainly a labor of love for captain sleet to describe as he does all the little detailed conveniences of his crow s nest but though he so enlarges upon many of these and thoughhe treats us to a very scientific account of his experimentsin this crow s nest with a small compass he kept therefor the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting fromwhat is called the local attraction of all binnacle magnets an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron inthe ship s planks and in the glacier s case perhaps to therehaving been so many broken down blacksmiths among her crew i say that though the captain is very discreet andscientific here yet for all his learned binnacle deviations azimuth compass observations and approximate errors he knows very well captain sleet that he was not so muchimmersed in those profound magnetic meditations as to fail beingattracted occasionally towards that well replenished littlecase bottle so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow s nest within easy reach of his hand though upon the whole i greatlyadmire and even love the brave the honest and learned captain yet i take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignorethat case bottle seeing what a faithful friend and comforterit must have been while with mittened fingers and hooded headhe was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird s nestwithin three or four perches of the pole but if we southern whale fishers are not so snugly housed aloftas captain sleet and his greenlandmen were yet that disadvantageis greatly counter balanced by the widely contrasting serenityof those seductive seas in which we south fishers mostly float for one i used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely resting in the top to have a chat with queequeg or any oneelse off duty whom i might find there then ascending a littleway further and throwing a lazy leg over the top sail yard take a preliminary view of the watery pastures and so at lastmount to my ultimate destination let me make a clean breast of it here and frankly admitthat i kept but sorry guard with the problem of the universerevolving in me how could i being left completely to myselfat such a thought engendering altitude how could i but lightlyhold my obligations to observe all whaleships standing orders keep your weather eye open and sing out every time and let me in this place movingly admonish you ye ship ownersof nantucket beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any ladwith lean brow and hollow eye given to unseasonable meditativeness and who offers to ship with the phaedon instead of bowditch in his head beware of such an one i say your whales must be seen before they canbe killed and this sunken eyed young platonist will tow you ten wakesround the world and never make you one pint of sperm the richer nor are these monitions at all unneeded for nowadays the whale fisheryfurnishes an asylum for many romantic melancholy and absent mindedyoung men disgusted with the corking care of earth and seekingsentiment in tar and blubber childe harold not unfrequently percheshimself upon the mast head of some luckless disappointed whale ship and in moody phrase ejaculates roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll ten thousand blubber hunters sweep over thee in vain very often do the captains of such ships take those absent minded youngphilosophers to task upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient interest in the voyage half hinting that they are so hopelesslylost to all honorable ambition as that in their secret souls theywould rather not see whales than otherwise but all in vain those young platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect they are short sighted what use then to strain the visual nerve they have left their opera glasses at home why thou monkey said a harpooneer to one of these lads we ve been cruising now hard upon three years and thou hastnot raised a whale yet whales are scarce as hen s teethwhenever thou art up here perhaps they were or perhapsthere might have been shoals of them in the far horizon but lulled into such an opium like listlessness of vacant unconscious reverie is this absent minded youth by the blendingcadence of waves with thoughts that at last he loses his identity takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image ofthat deep blue bottomless soul pervading mankind and nature and every strange half seen gliding beautiful thing that eludes him every dimly discovered uprising fin of some undiscernible form seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts thatonly people the soul by continually flitting through it in this enchanted mood thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came becomes diffused through time and space like crammer ssprinkled pantheistic ashes forming at last a part of everyshore the round globe over there is no life in thee now except that rocking life impartedby a gently rolling ship by her borrowed from the sea by the sea from the inscrutable tides of god but whilethis sleep this dream is on ye move your foot or hand an inch slip your hold at all and your identity comes back in horror over descartian vortices you hover and perhaps at midday in the fairest weather with one half throttled shriek you drop throughthat transparent air into the summer sea no more to rise for ever heed it well ye pantheists chapter the quarter deck enter ahab then all it was not a great while after the affair of the pipe that one morning shortly after breakfast ahab as was his wont ascended the cabin gangway to the deck there most sea captainsusually walk at that hour as country gentlemen after the same meal take a few turns in the garden soon his steady ivory stride was heard as to and fro he paced hisold rounds upon planks so familiar to his tread that they were allover dented like geological stones with the peculiar mark of his walk did you fixedly gaze too upon that ribbed and dented brow there also you would see still stranger foot prints the foot printsof his one unsleeping ever pacing thought but on the occasion in question those dents looked deeper even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark and so full of his thought was ahab that at every uniform turnthat he made now at the main mast and now at the binnacle you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned and pace in him as he paced so completely possessing him indeed that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement d ye mark him flask whispered stubb the chick that s in himpecks the shell twill soon be out the hours wore on ahab now shut up within his cabin anon pacing the deck with the same intense bigotry of purposein his aspect it drew near the close of day suddenly he came to a halt bythe bulwarks and inserting his bone leg into the auger hole there and with one hand grasping a shroud he ordered starbuckto send everybody aft sir said the mate astonished at an order seldom or never givenon ship board except in some extraordinary case send everybody aft repeated ahab mast heads there come down when the entire ship s company were assembled and with curiousand not wholly unapprehensive faces were eyeing him for he lookednot unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up ahab after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks and then darting hiseyes among the crew started from his standpoint and as thoughnot a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck with bent head and half slouched hat he continued to pace unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men till stubbcautiously whispered to flask that ahab must have summonedthem there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat but this did not last long vehemently pausing he cried what do ye do when ye see a whale men sing out for him was the impulsive rejoinder from a scoreof clubbed voices good cried ahab with a wild approval in his tones observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected questionhad so magnetically thrown them and what do ye next men lower away and after him and what tune is it ye pull to men a dead whale or a stove boat more and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving grew the countenance of the old man at every shout while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excitedat such seemingly purposeless questions but they were all eagerness again as ahab now half revolving in hispivot hole with one hand reaching high up a shroud and tightly almost convulsively grasping it addressed them thus all ye mast headers have before now heard me give orders about awhite whale look ye d ye see this spanish ounce of gold holding upa broad bright coin to the sun it is a sixteen dollar piece men d ye see it mr starbuck hand me yon top maul while the mate was getting the hammer ahab without speaking was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket as if to heighten its lustre and without using any words wasmeanwhile lowly humming to himself producing a sound so strangelymuffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical hummingof the wheels of his vitality in him receiving the top maul from starbuck he advanced towards the main mastwith the hammer uplifted in one hand exhibiting the gold with the other and with a high raised voice exclaiming whosoever of ye raisesme a white headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw whosoever of ye raises me that white headed whale with three holespunctured in his starboard fluke look ye whosoever of ye raises methat same white whale he shall have this gold ounce my boys huzza huzza cried the seamen as with swinging tarpaulinsthey hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast it s a white whale i say resumed ahab as he threw down the topmaul a white whale skin your eyes for him men look sharp for white water if ye see but a bubble sing out all this while tashtego daggoo and queequeg had looked on with evenmore intense interest and surprise than the rest and at the mentionof the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each wasseparately touched by some specific recollection captain ahab said tashtego that white whale must be the samethat some call moby dick moby dick shouted ahab do ye know the white whale then tash does he fan tail a little curious sir before he goes down said the gay header deliberately and has he a curious spout too said daggoo very bushy even for a parmacetty and mighty quick captain ahab and he have one two tree oh good many iron in him hide too captain cried queequeg disjointedly all twiske tee be twisk like him him faltering hard for a word and screwing his handround and round as though uncorking a bottle like him him corkscrew cried ahab aye queequeg the harpoons lieall twisted and wrenched in him aye daggoo his spout isa big one like a whole shock of wheat and white as a pileof our nantucket wool after the great annual sheep shearing aye tashtego and he fan tails like a split jib in a squall death and devils men it is moby dick ye have seen moby dick moby dick captain ahab said starbuck who with stubb and flask had thusfar been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise but at lastseemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder captain ahab i have heard of moby dick but it was not moby dickthat took off thy leg who told thee that cried ahab then pausing aye starbuck aye my hearties all round it was moby dick that dismasted me moby dick that brought me to this dead stump i stand on now aye aye he shouted with a terrific loud animal sob like that ofa heart stricken moose aye aye it was that accursed white whalethat razeed me made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day then tossing both arms with measureless imprecations he shouted out aye aye and i ll chase him round good hope and round the horn and round the norway maelstrom and round perdition s flamesbefore i give him up and this is what ye have shipped for men to chase that white whale on both sides of land and over allsides of earth till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out what say ye men will ye splice hands on it now i think yedo look brave aye aye shouted the harpooneers and seamen running closerto the excited old man a sharp eye for the white whale a sharp lance for moby dick god bless ye he seemed to half sob and half shout god bless ye men steward go draw the great measure of grog but what s this long face about mr starbuck wilt thou notchase the white whale art not game for moby dick i am game for his crooked jaw and for the jaws of death too captain ahab if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow but i came here to hunt whales not my commander s vengeance how many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it captain ahab it will not fetch thee much in our nantucket market nantucket market hoot but come closer starbuck thou requirest a little lower layer if money s to bethe measurer man and the accountants have computed theirgreat counting house the globe by girdling it with guineas one to every three parts of an inch then let me tell thee that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here he smites his chest whispered stubb what s that for methinks itrings most vast but hollow vengeance on a dumb brute cried starbuck that simply smote theefrom blindest instinct madness to be enraged with a dumb thing captain ahab seems blasphemous hark ye yet again the little lower layer all visible objects man are but as pasteboard masks but in each event in the living act the undoubted deed there some unknown but still reasoningthing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behindthe unreasoning mask if man will strike strike through the mask how can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall to me the white whale is that wall shoved near to me sometimes i think there s naught beyond but tis enough he tasks me he heaps me i see in him outrageous strength with an inscrutable malice sinewing it that inscrutablething is chiefly what i hate and be the white whale agent or be the white whale principal i will wreak that hate upon him talk not to me of blasphemy man i d strike the sun if it insulted me for could the sun do that then could i do the other since there is evera sort of fair play herein jealousy presiding over all creations but not my master man is even that fair play who s over me truth hath no confines take off thine eye more intolerablethan fiends glarings is a doltish stare so so thou reddenestand palest my heat has melted thee to anger glow but look ye starbuck what is said in heat that thing unsays itself there are men from whom warm words are small indignity i meant not to incense thee let it go look see yonder turkishcheeks of spotted tawn living breathing pictures painted by the sun the pagan leopards the unrecking and unworshipping things that live and seek and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel the crew man the crew are they not one and all with ahab in thismatter of the whale see stubb he laughs see yonder chilian he snorts to think of it stand up amid the general hurricane thy one tost sapling cannot starbuck and what is it reckon it tis but to help strike a fin no wondrous featfor starbuck what is it more from this one poor hunt then the best lance out of all nantucket surely he will nothang back when every foremast hand has clutched a whetstone ah constrainings seize thee i see the billow lifts thee speak but speak aye aye thy silence then that voices thee aside something shot from my dilated nostrils he hasinhaled it in his lungs starbuck now is mine cannot opposeme now without rebellion god keep me keep us all murmured starbuck lowly but in his joy at the enchanted tacit acquiescence of the mate ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation nor yet the lowlaugh from the hold nor yet the presaging vibrations ofthe winds in the cordage nor yet the hollow flap of the sailsagainst the masts as for a moment their hearts sank in for again starbuck s downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornnessof life the subterranean laugh died away the winds blew on the sails filled out the ship heaved and rolled as before ah ye admonitions and warnings why stay ye not when ye come but rather are ye predictions than warnings ye shadows yet not so much predictions from without as verificationsof the fore going things within for with little externalto constrain us the innermost necessities in our being these still drive us on the measure the measure cried ahab receiving the brimming pewter and turning to the harpooneers he ordered them to produce their weapons then ranging thembefore him near the capstan with their harpoons in their hands while his three mates stood at his side with their lances and the rest of the ship s company formed a circle round the group he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew but those wild eyes met his as the bloodshot eyes of the prairiewolves meet the eye of their leader ere he rushes on at their headin the trail of the bison but alas only to fall into the hiddensnare of the indian drink and pass he cried handing the heavy chargedflagon to the nearest seaman the crew alone now drink round with it round short draughts long swallows men tis hot as satan s hoof so so it goes round excellently it spiralizes in ye forks out at the serpent snapping eye well done almost drained that way it went this way it comes hand it me here s a hollow men ye seem the years so brimming life is gulped and gone steward refill attend now my braves i have mustered ye all round this capstan and ye mates flank me with your lances and ye harpooneers stand therewith your irons and ye stout mariners ring me in that i may in somesort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me o men you will yet see that ha boy come back bad pennies come not sooner hand it me why now this pewter had run brimming again wert not thoust vitus imp away thou ague advance ye mates cross your lances full before me well done let me touch the axis so saying with extended arm he graspedthe three level radiating lances at their crossed centre while so doing suddenly and nervously twitched them meanwhile glancing intently from starbuck to stubb from stubbto flask it seemed as though by some nameless interior volition he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotionaccumulated within the leyden jar of his own magnetic life the three mates quailed before his strong sustained and mystic aspect stubb and flask looked sideways from him the honest eye ofstarbuck fell downright in vain cried ahab but maybe tis well for did ye three but oncetake the full forced shock then mine own electric thing that had perhapsexpired from out me perchance too it would have dropped ye dead perchance ye need it not down lances and now ye mates i do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there yon three most honorable gentlemen and noblemen my valiant harpooneers disdain the task what when the great pope washes the feet of beggars using his tiara for ewer oh my sweet cardinals your own condescension that shall bend ye to it i do not order ye ye will it cut your seizings and draw the poles ye harpooneers silently obeying the order the three harpooneers now stoodwith the detached iron part of their harpoons some threefeet long held barbs up before him stab me not with that keen steel cant them cant themover know ye not the goblet end turn up the socket so so now ye cup bearers advance the irons take them hold them while i fill forthwith slowly going from one officerto the other he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fierywaters from the pewter now three to three ye stand commend the murderous chalices bestow them ye who are now made parties to thisindissoluble league ha starbuck but the deed is done yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon it drink ye harpooneers drink and swear ye men that man the deathful whaleboat s bow death to moby dick god hunt us all if we do not hunt moby dickto his death the long barbed steel goblets were lifted and to cries and maledictions against the white whale the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss starbuck paled and turned and shivered once more and finally the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew when waving his free hand to them they all dispersed and ahab retired within his cabin chapter sunsetthe cabin by the stern windows ahab sitting alone and gazing out i leave a white and turbid wake pale waters paler cheeks where er i sail the envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my

gone up with the rest my oath had been welded with theirs and stronger i shouted and moredid i hammer and clinch my oath because of the dread in my soul a wild mystical sympathetical feeling was in me ahab s quenchlessfeud seemed mine with greedy ears i learned the history of thatmurderous monster against whom i and all the others had taken our oathsof violence and revenge for some time past though at intervals only the unaccompanied secluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostlyfrequented by the sperm whale fishermen but not all of themknew of his existence only a few of them comparatively had knowingly seen him while the number who as yet hadactually and knowingly given battle to him was small indeed for owing to the large number of whale cruisers the disorderlyway they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference many of them adventurously pushing their quest alongsolitary latitudes so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonthor more on a stretch to encounter a single news telling sailof any sort the inordinate length of each separate voyage the irregularity of the times of sailing from home all these with other circumstances direct and indirect long obstructedthe spread through the whole world wide whaling fleet of the specialindividualizing tidings concerning moby dick it was hardlyto be doubted that several vessels reported to have encountered at such or such a time or on such or such a meridian a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity which whale after doing great mischief to his assailants has completelyescaped them to some minds it was not an unfair presumption i say that the whale in question must have been no other thanmoby dick yet as of late the sperm whale fishery had beenmarked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity cunning and malice in the monster attacked therefore it was that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to moby dick such hunters perhaps for the most part were content to ascribethe peculiar terror he bred more as it were to the perilsof the sperm whale fishery at large than to the individual cause in that way mostly the disastrous encounter between ahaband the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded and as for those who previously hearing of the white whale by chance caught sight of him in the beginning of the thingthey had every one of them almost as boldly and fearlesslylowered for him as for any other whale of that species but at length such calamities did ensue in these assaults not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles broken limbs or devouring amputations but fatal to the last degree of fatality those repeated disastrous repulses all accumulating and pilingtheir terrors upon moby dick those things had gone far toshake the fortitude of many brave hunters to whom the storyof the white whale had eventually come nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate and stillthe more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters for not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very bodyof all surprising terrible events as the smitten tree gives birthto its fungi but in maritime life far more than in that of terra firma wild rumors abound wherever there is any adequate reality for themto cling to and as the sea surpasses the land in this matter so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimescirculate there for not only are whalemen as a body unexemptfrom that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors but of all sailors they are by all odds the most directly broughtinto contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels but hand to jaw give battle to them alone in such remotest waters that thoughyou sailed a thousand miles and passed a thousand shores you wouldnot come to any chiselled hearth stone or aught hospitable beneaththat part of the sun in such latitudes and longitudes pursuing toosuch a calling as he does the whaleman is wrapped by influencesall tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth no wonder then that ever gathering volume from the mere transitover the wildest watery spaces the outblown rumors of the white whaledid in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints and half formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies which eventually invested moby dick with new terrors unborrowed fromanything that visibly appears so that in many cases such a panicdid he finally strike that few who by those rumors at least had heard of the white whale few of those hunters were willingto encounter the perils of his jaw but there were still other and more vital practical influences at work nor even at the present day has the original prestige of thesperm whale as fearfully distinguished from all other speciesof the leviathan died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body there are those this day among them who though intelligent andcourageous enough in offering battle to the greenland or right whale would perhaps either from professional inexperience or incompetency or timidity decline a contest with the sperm whale at any rate there are plenty of whalemen especially among those whaling nationsnot sailing under the american flag who have never hostilelyencountered the sperm whale but whose sole knowledge of the leviathanis restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north seated on their hatches these men will hearken with a childish firesideinterest and awe to the wild strange tales of southern whaling nor is the preeminent tremendousness of the great sperm whaleanywhere more feelingly comprehended than on board of those prowswhich stem him and as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendarytimes thrown its shadow before it we find some book naturalists olassen and povelson declaring the sperm whale not only to bea consternation to every other creature in the sea but also to beso incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood nor even down to so late a time as cuvier s were these or almostsimilar impressions effaced for in his natural history the baron himself affirms that at sight of the sperm whale all fish sharks included are struck with the most lively terrors and often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves againstthe rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death and however the general experiences in the fishery may amendsuch reports as these yet in their full terribleness even to thebloodthirsty item of povelson the superstitious belief in them is in some vicissitudes of their vocation revived in the mindsof the hunters so that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him not a few of the fishermen recalled in reference to moby dick the earlier days of the sperm whale fishery when it was oftentimeshard to induce long practised right whalemen to embark in the perilsof this new and daring warfare such men protesting that althoughother leviathans might be hopefully pursued yet to chase and pointlances at such an apparition as the sperm whale was not for mortal man that to attempt it would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity on this head there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted nevertheless some there were who even in the face of these thingswere ready to give chase to moby dick and a still greater number who chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely without the specificdetails of any certain calamity and without superstitious accompanimentswere sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered one of the wild suggestions referred to as at last coming to be linkedwith the white whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined was the unearthly conceit that moby dick was ubiquitous that he hadactually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the sameinstant of time nor credulous as such minds must have been was this conceitaltogether without some faint show of superstitious probability for as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yetbeen divulged even to the most erudite research so the hidden waysof the sperm whale when beneath the surface remain in great part unaccountable to his pursuers and from time to time have originatedthe most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them especially concerning the mystic modes whereby after soundingto a great depth he transports himself with such vast swiftnessto the most widely distant points it is a thing well known to both american and englishwhale ships and as well a thing placed upon authoritativerecord years ago by scoresby that some whales have beencaptured far north in the pacific in whose bodies have beenfound the barbs of harpoons darted in the greenland seas nor is it to be gainsaid that in some of these instances it hasbeen declared that the interval of time between the two assaultscould not have exceeded very many days hence by inference it has been believed by some whalemen that the nor west passage so long a problem to man was never a problem to the whale so that here in the real living experience of living men the prodigies related in old times of the inland strello mountainin portugal near whose top there was said to be a lake in whichthe wrecks of ships floated up to the surface and that stillmore wonderful story of the arethusa fountain near syracuse whose waters were believed to have come from the holy landby an underground passage these fabulous narrations are almostfully equalled by the realities of the whalemen forced into familiarity then with such prodigies as these and knowing that after repeated intrepid assaults the white whalehad escaped alive it cannot be much matter of surprise thatsome whalemen should go still further in their superstitions declaring moby dick not only ubiquitous but immortal for immortality is but ubiquity in time that though grovesof spears should be planted in his flanks he would still swimaway unharmed or if indeed he should ever be made to spoutthick blood such a sight would be but a ghastly deception for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away his unsullied jet would once more be seen but even stripped of these supernatural surmisings there was enoughin the earthly make and incontestable character of the monsterto strike the imagination with unwonted power for it was notso much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him fromother sperm whales but as was elsewhere thrown out a peculiarsnow white wrinkled forehead and a high pyramidical white hump these were his prominent features the tokens whereby even in the limitless uncharted seas he revealed his identity at a long distance to those who knew him the rest of his body was so streaked and spotted and marbled with the same shrouded hue that in the end he had gained his distinctive appellation of the white whale a name indeed literally justified by his vivid aspect when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea leaving a milky way wake of creamy foam all spangledwith golden gleamings nor was it his unwonted magnitude nor his remarkable hue nor yet hisdeformed lower jaw that so much invested the whale with natural terror as that unexampled intelligent malignity which according tospecific accounts he had over and over again evinced in his assaults more than all his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay thanperhaps aught else for when swimming before his exulting pursuers with every apparent symptom of alarm he had several times been knownto turn around suddenly and bearing down upon them either stave theirboats to splinters or drive them back in consternation to their ship already several fatalities had attended his chase but though similar disasters however little bruited ashore were by no means unusual in the fishery yet in most instances such seemed the white whale s infernal aforethought of ferocity that every dismembering or death that he caused was not whollyregarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent judge then to what pitches of inflamed distracted fury the mindsof his more desperate hunters were impelled when amid the chipsof chewed boats and the sinking limbs of torn comrades they swamout of the white curds of the whale s direful wrath into the serene exasperating sunlight that smiled on as if at a birth or a bridal his three boats stove around him and oars and men both whirling inthe eddies one captain seizing the line knife from his broken prow had dashed at the whale as an arkansas duellist at his foe blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom deep lifeof the whale that captain was ahab and then it was that suddenlysweeping his sickle shaped lower jaw beneath him moby dick hadreaped away ahab s leg as a mower a blade of grass in the field no turbaned turk no hired venetian or malay could have smote himwith more seeming malice small reason was there to doubt then that ever since that almost fatal encounter ahab had cherished a wildvindictiveness against the whale all the more fell for that in hisfrantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him not only allhis bodily woes but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations the white whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of allthose malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung that intangible malignity which has been from the beginning to whosedominion even the modern christians ascribe one half of the worlds which the ancient ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil ahab did not fall down and worship it like them but deliriouslytransferring its idea to the abhorred white whale he pitted himself all mutilated against it all that most maddens and torments all that stirs up the lees of things all truth with malice in it all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain all the subtle demonismsof life and thought all evil to crazy ahab were visibly personified and made practically assailable in moby dick he piled upon the whale swhite hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his wholerace from adam down and then as if his chest had been a mortar he burst his hot heart s shell upon it it is not probable that this monomania in him took its instantrise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment then in darting at the monster knife in hand he had butgiven loose to a sudden passionate corporal animosity and when he received the stroke that tore him he probablybut felt the agonizing bodily laceration but nothing more yet when by this collision forced to turn towards home and forlong months of days and weeks ahab and anguish lay stretchedtogether in one hammock rounding in mid winter that dreary howling patagonian cape then it was that his torn body and gashedsoul bled into one another and so interfusing made him mad that it was only then on the homeward voyage after the encounter that the final monomania seized him seems all but certainfrom the fact that at intervals during the passage he wasa raving lunatic and though unlimbed of a leg yet such vitalstrength yet lurked in his egyptian chest and was moreoverintensified by his delirium that his mates were forced to lacehim fast even there as he sailed raving in his hammock in a strait jacket he swung to the mad rockings of the gales and when running into more sufferable latitudes the ship with mild stun sails spread floated across the tranquil tropics and to all appearances the old man s delirium seemed left behindhim with the cape horn swells and he came forth from his darkden into the blessed light and air even then when he borethat firm collected front however pale and issued his calmorders once again and his mates thanked god the direful madnesswas now gone even then ahab in his hidden self raved on human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing when you think it fled it may have but become transfiguredinto some still subtler form ahab s full lunacy subsided not but deepeningly contracted like the unabated hudson when that noblenorthman flows narrowly but unfathomably through the highland gorge but as in his narrow flowing monomania not one jot of ahab sbroad madness had been left behind so in that broad madness not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished that before living agent now became the living instrument if such a furious trope may stand his special lunacy stormedhis general sanity and carried it and turned all its concentredcannon upon its own mad mark so that far from having losthis strength ahab to that one end did now possess a thousandfold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear uponany one reasonable object this is much yet ahab s larger darker deeper part remains unhinted but vain to popularize profundities and all truth is profound winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked hotel decluny where we here stand however grand and wonderful now quit it and take your way ye nobler sadder souls to those vast roman hallsof thermes where far beneath the fantastic towers of man s upper earth his root of grandeur his whole awful essence sits in bearded state an antique buried beneath antiquities and throned on torsoes so with a broken throne the great gods mock that captive king so like a caryatid he patient sits upholding on his frozen browthe piled entablatures of ages wind ye down there ye prouder sadder souls question that proud sad king a family likeness aye he did beget ye ye young exiled royalties and from your grim sireonly will the old state secret come now in his heart ahab had some glimpse of this namely all my means are sane my motive and my object mad yet without power to kill or change or shun the fact he likewise knew that to mankind he did now long dissemble in some sort did still but that thing of his dissembling wasonly subject to his perceptibility not to his will determinate nevertheless so well did he succeed in that dissembling that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last no nantucketerthought him otherwise than but naturally grieved and that tothe quick with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him the report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewisepopularly ascribed to a kindred cause and so too all the addedmoodiness which always afterwards to the very day of sailingin the pequod on the present voyage sat brooding on his brow nor is it so very unlikely that far from distrusting his fitnessfor another whaling voyage on account of such dark symptoms the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclinedto harbor the conceit that for those very reasons he wasall the better qualified and set on edge for a pursuitso full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales gnawed within and scorched without with the infixed unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea such an one could he be found would seem the very man to dart his ironand lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes or if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitatedfor that yet such an one would seem superlatively competentto cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack but be all this as it may certain it is that with the madsecret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him ahab hadpurposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only andall engrossing object of hunting the white whale had any oneof his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what waslurking in him then how soon would their aghast and righteoussouls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man they were bent on profitable cruises the profit to be counteddown in dollars from the mint he was intent on an audacious immitigable and supernatural revenge here then was this grey headed ungodly old man chasing withcurses a job s whale round the world at the head of a crew too chiefly made up of mongrel renegades and castaways and cannibals morally enfeebled also by the incompetenceof mere unaided virtue or right mindedness in starbuck the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessnessin stubb and the pervading mediocrity in flask such a crew so officered seemed specially picked and packed by someinfernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge how it was that they so aboundingly responded to the oldman s ire by what evil magic their souls were possessed that at times his hate seemed almost theirs the white whaleas much their insufferable foe as his how all this cameto be what the white whale was to them or how to theirunconscious understandings also in some dim unsuspected way he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life all this to explain would be to dive deeper than ishmael can go the subterranean miner that works in us all how can one tellwhither leads his shaft by the ever shifting muffled soundof his pick who does not feel the irresistible arm drag what skiff in tow of a seventy four can stand still for one i gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place but while yet all a rush to encounter the whale could seenaught in that brute but the deadliest ill chapter the whiteness of the whalewhat the white whale was to ahab has been hinted what at times he was to me as yet remains unsaid aside from those more obvious considerations touching moby dick which could not but occasionally awaken in any man s soul some alarm there was another thought or rather vague nameless horrorconcerning him which at times by its intensity completely overpoweredall the rest and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it that i almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form it was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me but how can i hope to explain myself here and yet in some dim random way explain myself i must else all these chaptersmight be naught though in many natural objects whiteness refininglyenhances beauty as if imparting some special virtue of its own as in marbles japonicas and pearls and though various nationshave in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue even the barbaric grand old kings of pegu placing the title lord of the white elephants above all their other magniloquentascriptions of dominion and the modern kings of siam unfurlingthe same snow white quadruped in the royal standard and thehanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow white charger and the great austrian empire caesarian heir to overlording rome having for the imperial color the same imperial hue and thoughthis pre eminence in it applies to the human race itself giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe and though besides all this whiteness has been even madesignificant of gladness for among the romans a white stone markeda joyful day and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings this same hue is made the emblem of many touching noble things the innocence of brides the benignity of age though amongthe red men of america the giving of the white belt of wampum wasthe deepest pledge of honor though in many climes whiteness typifiesthe majesty of justice in the ermine of the judge and contributesto the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk white steeds though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religionsit has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power by the persian fire worshippers the white forked flame beingheld the holiest on the altar and in the greek mythologies great jove himself being made incarnate in a snow white bull and though to the noble iroquois the midwinter sacrifice of the sacredwhite dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology that spotless faithful creature being held the purest envoy theycould send to the great spirit with the annual tidings of theirown fidelity and though directly from the latin word for white all christian priests derive the name of one part of theirsacred vesture the alb or tunic worn beneath the cassock and though among the holy pomps of the romish faith white isspecially employed in the celebration of the passion of our lord though in the vision of st john white robes are given to the redeemed and the four and twenty elders stand clothed in white beforethe great white throne and the holy one that sitteth therewhite like wool yet for all these accumulated associations with whatever is sweet and honorable and sublime there yetlurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness whichaffrights in blood this elusive quality it is which causes the thought of whiteness when divorced from more kindly associations and coupledwith any object terrible in itself to heighten that terrorto the furthest bounds witness the white bear of the poles and the white shark of the tropics what but their smooth flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are that ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness even more loathsome than terrific to the dumb gloating of their aspect so that not the fierce fanged tiger in his heraldic coat canso stagger courage as the white shrouded bear or shark with reference to the polar bear it may possibly be urged by him whowould fain go still deeper into this matter that it is not the whiteness separately regarded which heightens the intolerable hideousness ofthat brute for analysed that heightened hideousness it might be said only rises from the circumstance that the irresponsible ferociousnessof the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocenceand love and hence by bringing together two such opposite emotionsin our minds the polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast but even assuming all this to be true yet were it not for the whiteness you would not have that intensified terror as for the white shark the white gliding ghostliness of reposein that creature when beheld in his ordinary moods strangely tallieswith the same quality in the polar quadruped this peculiarity is mostvividly hit by the french in the name they bestow upon that fish the romish mass for the dead begins with requiem eternam eternal rest whence requiem denominating the mass itself and any other funeral music now in allusion to the white silent stillness of death in this shark and the mild deadlinessof his habits the french call him requin bethink thee of the albatross whence come those clouds of spiritualwonderment and pale dread in which that white phantom sailsin all imaginations not coleridge first threw that spell but god s great unflattering laureate nature i remember the first albatross i ever saw it was duringa prolonged gale in waters hard upon the antarctic seas from my forenoon watch below i ascended to the overclouded deck and there dashed upon the main hatches i saw a regal feathery thingof unspotted whiteness and with a hooked roman bill sublime at intervals it arched forth its vast archangel wings as if toembrace some holy ark wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it though bodily unharmed it uttered cries as some king s ghostin supernatural distress through its inexpressible strange eyes methought i peeped to secrets which took hold of god as abrahambefore the angels i bowed myself the white thing was so white its wings so wide and in those for ever exiled waters i hadlost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns long i gazed at that prodigy of plumage i cannot tell can only hint the things that darted through me then but at last i awoke and turning asked a sailor what bird was this a goney he replied goney never had heard that name before is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknownto men ashore never but some time after i learned that goneywas some seaman s name for albatross so that by no possibilitycould coleridge s wild rhyme have had aught to do with those mysticalimpressions which were mine when i saw that bird upon our deck for neither had i then read the rhyme nor knew the bird to bean albatross yet in saying this i do but indirectly burnisha little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet i assert then that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the birdchiefly lurks the secret of the spell a truth the more evinced in this that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses and these i have frequently seen but never with such emotions as when ibeheld the antarctic fowl but how had the mystic thing been caught whisper it not and i will tell with a treacherous hook and line as the fowlfloated on the sea at last the captain made a postman of it tying a lettered leathern tally round its neck with the ship stime and place and then letting it escape but i doubt not that leathern tally meant for man was taken off in heaven when the white fowl flew to join the wing folding the invoking and adoring cherubim most famous in our western annals and indian traditions is that ofthe white steed of the prairies a magnificent milk white charger large eyed small headed bluff chested and with the dignityof a thousand monarchs in his lofty overscorning carriage he was the elected xerxes of vast herds of wild horses whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the rocky mountainsand the alleghanies at their flaming head he westwardtrooped it like that chosen star which every evening leadson the hosts of light the flashing cascade of his mane the curving comet of his tail invested him with housings moreresplendent than gold and silver beaters could have furnished him a most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen western world which to the eyes of the old trappers and huntersrevived the glories of those primeval times when adam walkedmajestic as a god bluff bowed and fearless as this mighty steed whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van ofcountless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains like an ohio or whether with his circumambient subjects browsingall around at the horizon the white steed gallopingly reviewedthem with warm nostrils reddening through his cool milkiness in whatever aspect he presented himself always to the bravestindians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary recordof this noble horse that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly which so clothed him with divineness and that this divinenesshad that in it which though commanding worship at the sametime enforced a certain nameless terror but there are other instances where this whiteness losesall that accessory and strange glory which invests it inthe white steed and albatross what is it that in the albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocksthe eye as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin it is that whiteness which invests him a thing expressedby the name he bears the albino is as well made as other men has no substantive deformity and yet this mere aspect of all pervadingwhiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion why should this be so nor in quite other aspects does nature in her leastpalpable but not the less malicious agencies fail to enlistamong her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible from its snowy aspect the gauntleted ghost of the southern seas hasbeen denominated the white squall nor in some historic instances has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary how wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in froissart when masked in the snowy symbol of their faction the desperatewhite hoods of ghent murder their bailiff in the market place nor in some things does the common hereditary experience of allmankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue it cannot well be doubted that the one visible quality in the aspectof the dead which most appals the gazer is the marble pallorlingering there as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badgeof consternation in the other world as of mortal trepidation here and from that pallor of the dead we borrow the expressive hueof the shroud in which we wrap them nor even in our superstitionsdo we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms all ghosts rising in a milk white fog yea while these terrorsseize us let us add that even the king of terrors when personifiedby the evangelist rides on his pallid horse therefore in his other moods symbolize whatever grand or graciousthing he will by whiteness no man can deny that in its profoundestidealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul but though without dissent this point be fixed how is mortalman to account for it to analyse it would seem impossible can we then by the citation of some of those instanceswherein this thing of whiteness though for the time eitherwholly or in great part stripped of all direct associationscalculated to impart to it aught fearful but nevertheless is found to exert over us the same sorcery however modified can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct usto the hidden cause we seek let us try but in a matter like this subtlety appeals to subtlety and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls and though doubtless some at least of the imaginative impressionsabout to be presented may have been shared by most men yet fewperhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time and thereforemay not be able to recall them now why to the man of untutored ideality who happens to be butloosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day does the bare mention of whitsuntide marshal in the fancysuch long dreary speechless processions of slow pacing pilgrims down cast and hooded with new fallen snow or to the unread unsophisticated protestant of the middle american states why does the passing mention of a white friar or a white nun evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings which will not wholly account for it that makes the white towerof london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of anuntravelled american than those other storied structures its neighbors the byward tower or even the bloody and those sublimer towers the white mountains of new hampshire whence in peculiar moods comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mentionof that name while the thought of virginia s blue ridge is fullof a soft dewy distant dreaminess or why irrespective of alllatitudes and longitudes does the name of the white sea exertsuch a spectralness over the fancy while that of the yellow sealulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons onthe waves followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets or to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance purely addressedto the fancy why in reading the old fairy tales of central europe does the tall pale man of the hartz forests whose changelesspallor unrestingly glides through the green of the groves why is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping impsof the blocksburg nor is it altogether the remembrance of her cathedral topplingearthquakes nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas nor the tearlessnessof arid skies that never rain nor the sight of her wide fieldof leaning spires wrenched cope stones and crosses all adroop like canted yards of anchored fleets and her suburban avenuesof house walls lying over upon each other as a tossed pack of cards it is not these things alone which make tearless lima the strangest saddest city thou can st see for lima has taken the white veil and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe old as pizarro this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay spreads overher broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixesits own distortions i know that to the common apprehension this phenomenon of whitenessis not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terrorof objects otherwise terrible nor to the unimaginative mind is thereaught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mindalmost solely consists in this one phenomenon especially when exhibitedunder any form at all approaching to muteness or universality what i mean by these two statements may perhaps be respectivelyelucidated by the following examples first the mariner when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands if by night he hear the roar of breakers starts to vigilance and feelsjust enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties but underprecisely similar circumstances let him be called from his hammockto view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimminground him then he feels a silent superstitious dread the shroudedphantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings heart and helmthey both go down he never rests till blue water is under him again yet where is the mariner who will tell thee sir it was not so muchthe fear of striking hidden rocks as the fear of that hideous whitenessthat so stirred me second to the native indian of peru the continual sight ofthe snowhowdahed andes conveys naught of dread except perhaps in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigningat such vast altitudes and the natural conceit of what a fearfulnessit would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes much the sameis it with the backwoodsman of the west who with comparativeindifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness not so the sailor beholding the scenery of the antarctic seas where at times by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powersof frost and air he shivering and half shipwrecked instead ofrainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery views what seemsa boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monumentsand splintered crosses but thou sayest methinks this white lead chapter aboutwhiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul thou surrenderest to a hypo ishmael tell me why this strong young colt foaled in some peacefulvalley of vermont far removed from all beasts of prey why is it that upon the sunniest day if you but shake a freshbuffalo robe behind him so that he cannot even see it but onlysmells its wild animal muskiness why will he start snort and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright there is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creaturesin his green northern home so that the strange muskiness he smellscannot recall to him anything associated with the experienceof former perils for what knows he this new england colt of the black bisons of distant oregon no but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world though thousands of miles from oregon still when he smellsthat savage musk the rending goring bison herds are as presentas to the deserted wild foal of the prairies which this instantthey may be trampling into dust thus then the muffled rollings of a milky sea the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies all these to ishmael are as the shaking of that buffalo robeto the frightened colt though neither knows where lie the nameless things ofwhich the mystic sign gives forth such hints yet with me as with the colt somewhere those things must exist though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formedin love the invisible spheres were formed in fright but not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul and more strange and far more portentous why as we have seen it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things nay the very veil of the christian s deity and yet should be as it is the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartlessvoids and immensities of the universe and thus stabs us from behindwith the thought of annihilation when beholding the white depthsof the milky way or is it that as in essence whiteness is notso much a color as the visible absence of color and at the sametime the concrete of all colors is it for these reasons that thereis such a dumb blankness full of meaning in a wide landscapeof snows a colorless all color of atheism from which we shrink and when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers that all other earthly hues every stately or lovely emblazoning the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods yea and the gildedvelvets of butterflies and the butterfly cheeks of young girls all these are but subtile deceits not actually inherentin substances but only laid on from without so that all deifiednature absolutely paints like the harlot whose allurements covernothing but the charnel house within and when we proceed further and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces everyone of her hues the great principle of light for ever remainswhite or colorless in itself and if operating without mediumupon matter would touch all objects even tulips and roses with its own blank tinge pondering all this the palsied universelies before us a leper and like wilful travellers in lapland who refuse to wear colored and coloring glasses upon their eyes so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumentalwhite shroud that wraps all the prospect around him and of all these things the albino whale was the symbol wonder ye then at the fiery hunt chapter hark hist did you hear that noise cabaco it was the middle watch a fair moonlight the seamen werestanding in a cordon extending

flask one morning watch that there wassomething of that sort in the wind tish the bucket chapter the charthad you followed captain ahab down into his cabin after the squallthat took place on the night succeeding that wild ratificationof his purpose with his crew you would have seen him go to a lockerin the transom and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowishsea charts spread them before him on his screwed down table then seating himself before it you would have seen him intentlystudy the various lines and shadings which there met his eye and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spacesthat before were blank at intervals he would refer to pilesof old log books beside him wherein were set down the seasonsand places in which on various former voyages of various ships sperm whales had been captured or seen while thus employed the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chainsover his head continually rocked with the motion of the ship and for ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines uponhis wrinkled brow till it almost seemed that while he himselfwas marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses uponthe deeply marked chart of his forehead but it was not this night in particular that in the solitudeof his cabin ahab thus pondered over his charts almost every night they were brought out almost every nightsome pencil marks were effaced and others were substituted for with the charts of all four oceans before him ahab wasthreading a maze of currents and eddies with a view to the morecertain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul now to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out onesolitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet but not so did it seem to ahab who knew the sets of alltides and currents and thereby calculating the driftings ofthe sperm whale s food and also calling to mind the regular ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes could arrive at reasonable surmises almost approachingto certainties concerning the timeliest day to be upon thisor that ground in search of his prey so assured indeed is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the spermwhale s resorting to given waters that many hunters believe that could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond ininvariability to those of the herring shoals or the flights of swallows on this hint attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratorycharts of the sperm whale since the above was written the statement is happily borneout by an official circular issued by lieutenant maury of the national observatory washington april th by that circular it appears that precisely such a chart is in courseof completion and portions of it are presented in the circular this chart divides the ocean into districts of five degreesof latitude by five degrees of longitude perpendicularly througheach of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines one to show the number of days that have been spent in each monthin every district and the two others to show the number of daysin which whales sperm or right have been seen besides when making a passage from one feeding ground to another the sperm whales guided by some infallible instinct say rather secret intelligence from the deity mostly swim in veins as theyare called continuing their way along a given ocean line withsuch undeviating exactitude that no ship ever sailed her course by any chart with one tithe of such marvellous precision though in these cases the direction taken by any one whalebe straight as a surveyor s parallel and though the lineof advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable straight wake yet the arbitrary vein in which at these timeshe is said to swim generally embraces some few miles in width more or less as the vein is presumed to expand or contract but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale ship smast heads when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone the sum is that at particular seasons within that breadthand along that path migrating whales may with great confidencebe looked for and hence not only at substantiated times upon well knownseparate feeding grounds could ahab hope to encounter his prey but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those groundshe could by his art so place and time himself on his way as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting there was a circumstance which at first sight seemedto entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme but not so in the reality perhaps though the gregarioussperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which hauntedsuch and such a latitude or longitude this year say will turnout to be identically the same with those that were found therethe preceding season though there are peculiar and unquestionableinstances where the contrary of this has proved true in general the same remark only within a less wide limit applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured aged sperm whales so that though moby dick had in a formeryear been seen for example on what is called the seychelleground in the indian ocean or volcano bay on the japanese coast yet it did not follow that were the pequod to visit eitherof those spots at any subsequent corresponding season she would infallibly encounter him there so too with someother feeding grounds where he had at times revealed himself but all these seemed only his casual stopping places andocean inns so to speak not his places of prolonged abode and where ahab s chances of accomplishing his objecthave hitherto been spoken of allusion has only been madeto whatever way side antecedent extra prospects were his ere a particular set time or place were attained when allpossibilities would become probabilities and as ahabfondly thought every possibility the next thing to a certainty that particular set time and place were conjoined in the onetechnical phrase the season on the line for there and then for several consecutive years moby dick had been periodicallydescried lingering in those waters for awhile as the sun in its annual round loiters for a predicted interval in anyone sign of the zodiac there it was too that most ofthe deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place there the waves were storied with his deeds there also wasthat tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had foundthe awful motive to his vengeance but in the cautiouscomprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which ahabthrew his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt he would notpermit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning factabove mentioned however flattering it might be to those hopes nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillizehis unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest now the pequod had sailed from nantucket at the very beginningof the season on the line no possible endeavor then couldenable her commander to make the great passage southwards double cape horn and then running down sixty degrees of latitudearrive in the equatorial pacific in time to cruise there therefore he must wait for the next ensuing season yet the premature hour of the pequod s sailing had perhaps been correctly selected by ahab with a view to this very complexionof things because an interval of three hundred and sixty fivedays and nights was before him an interval which instead ofimpatiently enduring ashore he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt if by chance the white whale spending his vacation in seasfar remote from his periodical feeding grounds should turn uphis wrinkled brow off the persian gulf or in the bengal bay or china seas or in any other waters haunted by his race so that monsoons pampas nor westers harmattans trades any windbut the levanter and simoon might blow moby dick into the deviouszig zag world circle of the pequod s circumnavigating wake but granting all this yet regarded discreetly and coolly seems it not but a mad idea this that in the broadboundless ocean one solitary whale even if encountered should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter even as a white bearded mufti in the thronged thoroughfaresof constantinople yes for the peculiar snow white brow ofmoby dick and his snow white hump could not but be unmistakable and have i not tallied the whale ahab would mutter to himself as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he wouldthrow himself back in reveries tallied him and shall he escape his broad fins are bored and scalloped out like a lost sheep s ear and here his mad mind would run on in a breathless race till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recoverhis strength ah god what trances of torments does that manendure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire he sleeps with clenched hands and wakes with his own bloodynails in his palms often when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerablyvivid dreams of the night which resuming his own intense thoughtsthrough the day carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies and whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain till the very throbbing of his life spot became insufferable anguish and when as was sometimes the case these spiritual throes in himheaved his being up from its base and a chasm seemed opening in him from which forked flames and lightnings shot up and accursed fiendsbeckoned him to leap down among them when this hell in himselfyawned beneath him a wild cry would be heard through the ship and with glaring eyes ahab would burst from his state room as thoughescaping from a bed that was on fire yet these perhaps instead ofbeing the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness or frightat his own resolve were but the plainest tokens of its intensity for at such times crazy ahab the scheming unappeasedly steadfasthunter of the white whale this ahab that had gone to his hammock was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again the latter was the eternal living principle or soul in him and in sleep being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of thefrantic thing of which for the time it was no longer an integral but as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul therefore itmust have been that in ahab s case yielding up all his thoughtsand fancies to his one supreme purpose that purpose by its own sheerinveteracy of will forced itself against gods and devils into a kindof self assumed independent being of its own nay could grimlylive and burn while the common vitality to which it was conjoined fled horror stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth therefore the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes when whatseemed ahab rushed from his room was for the time but a vacated thing a formless somnambulistic being a ray of living light to be sure but without an object to color and therefore a blankness in itself god help thee old man thy thoughts have created a creature in thee and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a prometheus a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever that vulture the verycreature he creates chapter the affidavitso far as what there may be of a narrative in this book and indeed as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curiousparticulars in the habits of sperm whales the foregoing chapter in itsearlier part is as important a one as will be found in this volume but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and morefamiliarly enlarged upon in order to be adequately understood and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignoranceof the entire subject may induce in some minds as to the naturalverity of the main points of this affair i care not to perform this part of my task methodically but shall be content to produce the desired impressionby separate citations of items practically or reliably knownto me as a whaleman and from these citations i take it the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself first i have personally known three instances where a whale after receiving a harpoon has effected a complete escape and after an interval in one instance of three years has beenagain struck by the same hand and slain when the two irons both marked by the same private cypher have been taken from the body in the instance where three years intervened between the flingingof the two harpoons and i think it may have been something morethan that the man who darted them happening in the interval to go in a trading ship on a voyage to africa went ashore there joined a discovery party and penetrated far into the interior where he travelled for a period of nearly two years often endangeredby serpents savages tigers poisonous miasmas with all the othercommon perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions meanwhile the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe brushing with itsflanks all the coasts of africa but to no purpose this man andthis whale again came together and the one vanquished the other i say i myself have known three instances similar to this that is in two of them i saw the whales struck and upon the secondattack saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them afterwards taken from the dead fish in the three year instance it so fell out that i was in the boat both times first and last and the last time distinctly recognized a peculiar sort of huge moleunder the whale s eye which i had observed there three years previous i say three years but i am pretty sure it was more than that here are three instances then which i personally know the truth of but i have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracityin the matter there is no good ground to impeach secondly it is well known in the sperm whale fishery however ignorantthe world ashore may be of it that there have been severalmemorable historical instances where a particular whale in the oceanhas been at distant times and places popularly cognisable why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originallyowing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him and boilinghim down into a peculiarly valuable oil no the reason was this that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hunga terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as theredid about rinaldo rinaldini insomuch that most fishermen werecontent to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulinswhen he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance like some poor devils ashore that happen to known an irasciblegreat man they make distant unobtrusive salutations to himin the street lest if they pursued the acquaintance further they might receive a summary thump for their presumption but not only did each of these famous whales enjoy greatindividual celebrity nay you may call it an oceanwide renown not only was he famous in life and now is immortal inforecastle stories after death but he was admitted intoall the rights privileges and distinctions of a name had as much a name indeed as cambyses or caesar was it not so o timor tom thou famed leviathan scarred like an iceberg who so long did st lurk in the oriental straits of that name whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of ombay was itnot so o new zealand jack thou terror of all cruisers that crossedtheir wakes in the vicinity of the tattoo land was it not so o morquan king of japan whose lofty jet they say at timesassumed the semblance of a snow white cross against the sky was it not so o don miguel thou chilian whale marked likean old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back in plain prose here are four whales as well known to the studentsof cetacean history as marius or sylla to the classic scholar but this is not all new zealand tom and don miguel after at varioustimes creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels were finally gone in quest of systematically hunted out chased and killed by valiant whaling captains who heaved up theiranchors with that express object as much in view as in settingout through the narragansett woods captain butler of old had itin his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage annawon the headmost warrior of the indian king philip i do not know where i can find a better place than just here to make mention of one or two other things which to me seem important as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonablenessof the whole story of the white whale more especially the catastrophe for this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requiresfull as much bolstering as error so ignorant are most landsmen of someof the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world that withoutsome hints touching the plain facts historical and otherwise of the fishery they might scout at moby dick as a monstrous fable or still worse and more detestable a hideous and intolerable allegory first though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the generalperils of the grand fishery yet they have nothing like a fixed vividconception of those perils and the frequency with which they recur one reason perhaps is that not one in fifty of the actual disastersand deaths by casualties in the fishery ever finds a public recordat home however transient and immediately forgotten that record do you suppose that that poor fellow there who this moment perhapscaught by the whale line off the coast of new guinea is beingcarried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan do you suppose that that poor fellow s name will appear in the newspaperobituary you will read to morrow at your breakfast no because themails are very irregular between here and new guinea in fact did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirectfrom new guinea yet i will tell you that upon one particular voyagewhich i made to the pacific among many others we spoke thirtydifferent ships every one of which had had a death by a whale some of them more than one and three that had each lost a boat s crew for god s sake be economical with your lamps and candles not a gallonyou burn but at least one drop of man s blood was spilled for it secondly people ashore have indeed some indefinite ideathat a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power but i have ever found that when narrating to them some specificexample of this two fold enormousness they have significantlycomplimented me upon my facetiousness when i declare uponmy soul i had no more idea of being facetious than moses when he wrote the history of the plagues of egypt but fortunately the special point i here seek can be establishedupon testimony entirely independent of my own that point is this the sperm whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful knowing and judiciously malicious as with direct aforethought to stave in utterly destroy and sink a large ship and what is more the sperm whale has done it first in the year the ship essex captain pollard of nantucket was cruising in the pacific ocean one dayshe saw spouts lowered her boats and gave chase to a shoalof sperm whales ere long several of the whales were wounded when suddenly a very large whale escaping from the boats issued from the shoal and bore directly down upon the ship dashing his forehead against her hull he so stove her in that in less than ten minutes she settled down and fell over not a surviving plank of her has been seen since after the severest exposure part of the crew reached the landin their boats being returned home at last captain pollardonce more sailed for the pacific in command of another ship but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers for the second time his ship was utterly lost and forthwithforswearing the sea he has never attempted it since at this day captain pollard is a resident of nantucket i haveseen owen chace who was chief mate of the essex at the timeof the tragedy i have read his plain and faithful narrative i have conversed with his son and all this within a few milesof the scene of the catastrophe the following are extracts from chace s narrative every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it wasanything but chance which directed his operations he made twoseveral attacks upon the ship at a short interval between them both of this catastrophe i have never chanced to their direction were calculated to do us the whale hunters i have now and thenheard casual allusions to it thirdly some eighteen or twenty years ago commodore j then commandingan american sloop of war of the first class happened to be diningwith a party of whaling captains on board a nantucket ship in theharbor of oahu sandwich islands conversation turning upon whales the commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazingstrength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present he peremptorily denied for example that any whale couldso smite his stout sloop of war as to cause her to leak so muchas a thimbleful very good but there is more coming some weeks later the commodore set sail in this impregnable craftfor valparaiso but he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale that begged a few moments confidential business with him that business consisted in fetching the commodore s craft such a thwack that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearestport to heave down and repair i am not superstitious but iconsider the commodore s interview with that whale as providential was not saul of tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright i tell you the sperm whale will stand no nonsense i will now refer you to langsdorff s voyages for a little circumstancein point peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof langsdorff youmust know by the way was attached to the russian admiral krusenstern sfamous discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century captain langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter by the thirteenth of may our ship was ready to sail and the next day we were out in the open sea on our wayto ochotsh the weather was very clear and fine but so intolerablycold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing for some days we had very little wind it was not tillthe nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up an uncommonly large whale the body of which was largerthan the ship itself lay almost at the surface of the water but was not perceived by any one on board till the momentwhen the ship which was in full sail was almost upon him so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him we were thus placed in the most imminent danger as this giganticcreature setting up its back raised the ship three feet at leastout of the water the masts reeled and the sails fell altogether while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck concluding that we had struck upon some rock instead of this wesaw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity captain d wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examinewhether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured now the captain d wolf here alluded to as commanding the shipin question is a new englander who after a long life of unusualadventures as a sea captain this day resides in the villageof dorchester near boston i have the honor of being a nephewof his i have particularly questioned him concerningthis passage in langsdorff he substantiates every word the ship however was by no means a large one a russiancraft built on the siberian coast and purchased by my uncleafter bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home in that up and down manly book of old fashioned adventure so full too of honest wonders the voyage of lionel wafer one of ancient dampier s old chums i found a little matterset down so like that just quoted from langsdorff that icannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example if such be needed lionel it seems was on his way to john ferdinando as he calls the modern juan fernandes in our way thither he says about four o clock in the morning when we were aboutone hundred and fifty leagues from the main of america our shipfelt a terrible shock which put our men in such consternationthat they could hardly tell where they were or what to think but every one began to prepare for death and indeed the shockwas so sudden and violent that we took it for granted the shiphad struck against a rock but when the amazement was a little over we cast the lead and sounded but found no ground thesuddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks captain davis who lay with his head on a gun was thrownout of his cabin lionel then goes on to impute the shockto an earthquake and seems to substantiate the imputationby stating that a great earthquake somewhere about that time did actually do great mischief along the spanish land but i should not much wonder if in the darkness of that earlyhour of the morning the shock was after all caused by an unseenwhale vertically bumping the hull from beneath i might proceed with several more examples one way or another knownto me of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale in more than one instance he has been known not only to chasethe assailing boats back to their ships but to pursue the ship itself and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks the english ship pusie hall can tell a story on that head and as for his strength let me say that there have been exampleswhere the lines attached to a running sperm whale have in a calm been transferred to the ship and secured there the whale towingher great hull through the water as a horse walks off with a cart again it is very often observed that if the sperm whale once struck is allowed time to rally he then acts not so often with blind rage as with wilful deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes but i must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration a remarkable and most significant one by which you will not failto see that not only is the most marvellous event in this bookcorroborated by plain facts of the present day but that these marvels like all marvels are mere repetitions of the ages so that forthe millionth time we say amen with solomon verily there is nothingnew under the sun in the sixth christian century lived procopius a christianmagistrate of constantinople in the days when justinianwas emperor and belisarius general as many know he wrotethe history of his own times a work every way of uncommon value by the best authorities he has always been considered a mosttrustworthy and unexaggerating historian except in some oneor two particulars not at all affecting the matter presentlyto be mentioned now in this history of his procopius mentions that during the term ofhis prefecture at constantinople a great sea monster was captured in theneighboring propontis or sea of marmora after having destroyed vesselsat intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years a fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid nor is there any reason it should be of what precise species thissea monster was is not mentioned but as he destroyed ships as well as for other reasons he must have been a whale and i amstrongly inclined to think a sperm whale and i will tell you why for a long time i fancied that the sperm whale had been alwaysunknown in the mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it even now i am certain that those seas are not and perhaps never can be in the present constitution of things a place for his habitualgregarious resort but further investigations have recently proved to me that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presenceof the sperm whale in the mediterranean i am told on good authority that on the barbary coast a commodore davis of the british navy foundthe skeleton of a sperm whale now as a vessel of war readily passesthrough the dardanelles hence a sperm whale could by the same route pass out of the mediterranean into the propontis in the propontis as far as i can learn none of that peculiarsubstance called brit is to be found the aliment of the right whale but i have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale squid or cuttle fish lurks at the bottom of that sea because large creatures but by no means the largest of that sort have been found at its surface if then you properlyput these statements together and reason upon them a bit you will clearly perceive that according to all human reasoning procopius s sea monster that for half a century stove the shipsof a roman emperor must in all probability have been a sperm whale chapter surmisesthough consumed with the hot fire of his purpose ahab in all histhoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of moby dick though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to thatone passion nevertheless it may have been that he was by natureand long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman s ways altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage or at least if this were otherwise there were not wanting othermotives much more influential with him it would be refiningtoo much perhaps even considering his monomania to hint that hisvindictiveness towards the white whale might have possibly extendeditself in some degree to all sperm whales and that the more monstershe slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that eachsubsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted but if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable there were stilladditional considerations which though not so strictly accordingwith the wildness of his ruling passion yet were by no meansincapable of swaying him to accomplish his object ahab must use tools and of all tools usedin the shadow of the moon men are most apt to get out of order he knew for example that however magnetic his ascendency in somerespects was over starbuck yet that ascendency did not coverthe complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiorityinvolves intellectual mastership for to the purely spiritual the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation starbuck s body and starbuck s coerced will were ahab s so long as ahabkept his magnet at starbuck s brain still he knew that for all thisthe chief mate in his soul abhorred his captain s quest and could he would joyfully disintegrate himself from it or even frustrate it it might be that a long interval would elapse ere the white whalewas seen during that long interval starbuck would ever be apt to fallinto open relapses of rebellion against his captain s leadership unless some ordinary prudential circumstantial influences were broughtto bear upon him not only that but the subtle insanity of ahabrespecting moby dick was noways more significantly manifested than in hissuperlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that for the present the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginativeimpiousness which naturally invested it that the full terror of thevoyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background for few men scourage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action that when they stood their long night watches his officers and men musthave some nearer things to think of than moby dick for however eagerlyand impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable they live in the varying outer weather and they inhale its fickleness and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit however promissory of life and passion in the end it is above all thingsrequisite that temporary interests and employments should interveneand hold them healthily suspended for the final dash nor was ahab unmindful of another thing in times of strong emotionmankind disdain all base considerations but such times are evanescent the permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man thought ahab is sordidness granting that the white whale fullyincites the hearts of this my savage crew and playing roundtheir savageness even breeds a certain generous knight errantismin them still while for the love of it they give chase to moby dick they must also have food for their more common daily appetites for even the high lifted and chivalric crusaders of old timeswere not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fightfor their holy sepulchre without committing burglaries picking pockets and gaining other pious perquisites by the way had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object that final and romantic object too many would have turnedfrom in disgust i will not strip these men thought ahab of all hopes of cash aye cash they may scorn cash now but let some months go by and no perspective promise of it to them and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them this same cash would soon cashier ahab nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive morerelated to ahab personally having impulsively it is probable and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but privatepurpose of the pequod s voyage ahab was now entirely conscious that in so doing he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerablecharge of usurpation and with perfect impunity both moral and legal his crew if so disposed and to that end competent could refuse allfurther obedience to him and even violently wrest from him the command from even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation and the possibleconsequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself that protection could only consist in his own predominating brainand heart and hand backed by a heedful closely calculating attentionto every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for hiscrew to be subjected to for all these reasons then and others perhaps too analytic to be verballydeveloped here ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degreecontinue true to the natural nominal purpose of the pequod s voyage observe all customary usages and not only that but force himselfto evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuitof his profession be all this as it may his voice was now often heardhailing the three mastheads and admonishing them to keepa bright look out and not omit reporting even a porpoise this vigilance was not long without reward chapter the mat makerit was a cloudy sultry afternoon the seamen were lazily loungingabout the decks or vacantly gazing over into the lead colored waters queequeg and i were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword mat for an additional lashing to our boat so still and subdued and yetsomehow preluding was all the scene and such an incantation of revelrylurked in the air that each silent sailor seemed resolved into hisown invisible self i was the attendant or page of queequeg while busy at the mat as i kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marlinebetween the long yarns of the warp using my own hand for the shuttle and as queequeg standing sideways ever and anon slid his heavyoaken sword between the threads and idly looking off uponthe water carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn i say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all overthe ship and all over the sea only broken by the intermittingdull sound of the sword that it seemed as if this werethe loom of time and i myself were a shuttle mechanicallyweaving and weaving away at the fates there lay the fixedthreads of the warp subject to but one single ever returning unchanging vibration and that vibration merely enough to admitof the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own this warp seemed necessity and here thought i with my ownhand i ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny intothese unalterable threads meantime queequeg s impulsive indifferent sword sometimes hitting the woof slantingly or crookedly or strongly or weakly as the case might be and by this difference in the concluding blow producing acorresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric this savage s sword thought i which thus finally shapes and fashionsboth warp and woof this easy indifferent sword must be chance aye chance free will and necessity no wise incompatible all interweavingly working together the straight warpof necessity not to be swerved from its ultimate course its every alternating vibration indeed only tending to that free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads and chance though restrained in its play within the right linesof necessity and sideways in its motions directed by free will though thus prescribed to by both chance by turns rules either and has the last featuring blow at events thus we were weaving and weaving away when i started at a soundso strange long drawn and musically wild and unearthly that the ball of free will dropped from my hand and i stoodgazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing high aloft in the cross trees was that mad gay header tashtego his body was reaching eagerly forward his hand stretched outlike a wand and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries to be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps beingheard all over the seas from hundreds of whalemen s look outsperched as high in the air but from few of those lungs couldthat accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadenceas from tashtego the indian s as he stood hovering over you half suspended in air so wildlyand eagerly peering towards the horizon you would have thoughthim some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of fate and by those wild cries announcing their coming there she blows there there there she blows she blows where away on the lee beam about two miles off a school of them instantly all was commotion the sperm whale blows as a clock ticks with the same undeviatingand reliable uniformity and thereby whalemen distinguish thisfish from other tribes of his genus there go flukes was now the cry from tashtego and the whales disappeared quick steward cried ahab time time dough boy hurried below glanced at the watch and reported the exactminute to ahab the ship was now kept away from the wind and she went gentlyrolling before it tashtego reporting that the whaleshad gone down heading to leeward we confidently lookedto see them again directly in advance of our bows for that singular craft at times evinced by the sperm whale when sounding with his head in one direction he nevertheless while concealed beneath the surface mills around and swiftlyswims off in the opposite quarter this deceitfulness of hiscould not now be in action for there was no reason to supposethat the fish seen by tashtego had been in any way alarmed or indeed knew at all of our vicinity one of the men selectedfor shipkeepers that is those not appointed to the boats by this time relieved the indian at the main mast head the sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down the linetubs were fixed in their places the cranes were thrust out the mainyard was backed and the three boats swung overthe sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clungto the rail while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale so look the long line of man of war s men about to throwthemselves on board an enemy s ship but at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that tookevery eye from the whale with a start all glared at dark ahab who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formedout of air chapter the first loweringthe phantoms for so they then seemed were flitting on the otherside of the deck and with a noiseless celerity were casting loosethe tackles and bands of the boat which swung there this boat hadalways been deemed one of the spare boats though technically calledthe captain s on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter the figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel like lips a rumpled chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff but strangelycrowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head less swart in aspect the companions of this figure were of that vivid tiger yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal nativesof the manillas a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spiesand secret confidential agents on the water of the devil their lord whose counting room they suppose to be elsewhere while yet the wondering ship s company were gazing upon these strangers ahab cried out to the white turbaned old man at their head all ready there fedallah ready was the half hissed reply lower away then d ye hear shouting across the deck lower away there i say such was the thunder of his voice that spite of theiramazement the men sprang over the rail the sheaves whirledround in the blocks with a wallow the three boats droppedinto the sea while with a dexterous off handed daring unknown in any other vocation the sailors goat like leapeddown the rolling ship s side into the tossed boats below hardly had they pulled out from under the ship s lee when a fourth keel coming from the windward side pulled round under the stern and showed the five strangers rowing ahab who standing erectin the stern loudly hailed starbuck stubb and flask to spreadthemselves widely so as to cover a large expanse of water but with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart fedallah andhis crew the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command captain ahab said starbuck spread yourselves cried ahab give way all four boats thou flask pull out more to leeward aye aye sir cheerily cried little king post sweeping round hisgreat steering oar lay back addressing his crew there there there again there she blows right ahead boys lay back never heed yonder yellow boys archy oh i don t mind em sir said archy i knew it all before now didn t i hear em in the hold and didn t i tell cabaco here of it what say ye cabaco they are stowaways mr flask pull pull my fine hearts alive pull my children pull my little ones drawlingly and soothingly sighed stubbto his crew some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness why don t you break your backbones my boys what is it you stare at those chaps in yonder boat tut they are only five more handscome to help us never mind from where the more the merrier pull then do pull never mind the brimstone devils are goodfellows enough so so there you are now that s the strokefor a thousand pounds that s the stroke to sweep the stakes hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil my heroes three cheers men all hearts alive easy easy don t be in a hurry don t be in a hurry why don t you snap your oars you rascals bite something you dogs so so so then softly softly that s it that s it long and strong give way there give way the devil fetch ye ye ragamuffin rapscallions ye are all asleep stop snoring ye sleepers and pull pull will ye pull can t ye pull won t ye why in the name of gudgeons andginger cakes don t ye pull pull and break something pull and start your eyes out here whipping out the sharp knifefrom his girdle every mother s son of ye draw his knife and pull with the blade between his teeth that s it that s it now ye do something that looks like it my steel bits start her start her my silverspoons start her marling spikes stubb s exordium to his crew is given here at large because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing but you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizingsthat he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation not at all and therein consisted his chief peculiarity he would say the most terrific things to his crew in a toneso strangely compounded of fun and fury and the fury seemedso calculated merely as a spice to the fun that no oarsmancould hear such queer invocations without pulling fordear life and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself so loungingly managed his steering oar and so broadly gaped open mouthed at times that the mere sight of such a yawning commander by sheer force of contrast acted like a charm upon the crew then again stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous as to putall inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them in obedience to a sign from ahab starbuck was now pulling obliquelyacross stubb s bow and when for a minute or so the two boats werepretty near to each other stubb hailed the mate mr starbuck larboard boat there ahoy a word with ye sir if ye please halloa returned starbuck turning round not a single inchas he spoke still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew his face set like a flint from stubb s what think ye of those yellow boys sir smuggled on board somehow before the ship sailed strong strong boys in a whisper to his crew then speaking out loud again a sad business mr stubb seethe her seethe her my lads but never mind mr stubb all for the best let all your crew pull strong come what will spring my men spring there s hogsheads of sperm ahead mr stubb and that s what ye came for pull my boys sperm sperm s the play this at least is duty duty and profithand in hand aye aye i thought as much soliloquized stubb when theboats diverged as soon as i clapt eye on em i thought so aye and that s what he went into the after hold for so often as dough boy long suspected they were hidden down there the white whale s at the bottom of it well well so be it can t be helped all right give way men it ain t the white whaleto day give way now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a criticalinstant as the lowering of the boats from the deck this had notunreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some ofthe ship s company but archy s fancied discovery having some timeprevious got abroad among them though indeed not credited then this had in some small measure prepared them for the event it took off the extreme edge of their wonder and so what with allthis and stubb s confident way of accounting for their appearance they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings though theaffair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjecturesas to dark ahab s precise agency in the matter from the beginning for me i silently recalled the mysterious shadows i had seencreeping on board the pequod during the dim nantucket dawn as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable elijah meantime ahab out of hearing of his officers having sidedthe furthest to windward was still ranging ahead of the other boats a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone like five trip hammers they rose and fell with regular strokesof strength which periodically started the boat along the waterlike a horizontal burst boiler out of a mississippi steamer as for fedallah who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar he had thrown aside his black jacket and displayed his naked chestwith the whole part of his body above the gunwale clearly cutagainst the alternating depressions of the watery horizon while at the other end of the boat ahab with one arm like a fencer s thrown half backward into the air as if to counterbalance anytendency to trip ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oaras in a thousand boat lowerings ere the white whale had torn him all at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motionand then remained fixed while the boat s five oars were seensimultaneously peaked boat and crew sat motionless on the sea instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way the whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement though from his closer vicinity ahab had observed it every man look out along his oars cried starbuck thou queequeg stand up nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow the savage stood erect there and with intensely eager eyes gazedoff towards the spot where the chase had last been descried likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was alsotriangularly platformed level with the gunwale starbuck himselfwas seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerkingtossings of his chip of a craft and silently eyeing the vastblue eye of the sea not very far distant flask s boat was also lying breathlessly still its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead a stout sort of post rooted in the keel and rising some two feetabove the level of the stern platform it is used for catching turnswith the whale line its top is not more spacious than the palm of aman s hand and standing upon such a base as that flask seemed perchedat the mast head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks but little king post was small and short and at the same time littleking post was full of a large and tall ambition so that this loggerhead stand point of his did by no means satisfy king post i can t see three seas off tip us up an oar there and letme onto that upon this daggoo with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way swiftly slid aft and then erecting himself volunteered his loftyshoulders for a pedestal good a mast head as any sir will you mount that i will and thank ye very much my fine fellow only i wish you fifty feet taller whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks ofthe boat the gigantic negro stooping a little presented his flat palmto flask s foot and then putting flask s hand on his hearse plumedhead and bidding him spring as he himself should toss with onedexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders and here was flask now standing daggoo with one lifted arm furnishinghim with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by at any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see withwhat wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whalemanwill maintain an erect posture in his boat even when pitchedabout by the most riotously perverse and cross running seas still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself under such circumstances but the sight of littleflask mounted upon gigantic daggoo was yet more curious for sustaining himself with a cool indifferent easy unthought of barbaric majesty the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniouslyrolled his fine form on his broad back flaxen haired flaskseemed a snow flake the bearer looked nobler than the rider though truly vivacious tumultuous ostentatious little flaskwould now and then stamp with impatience but not one addedheave did he thereby give to the negro s lordly chest so have i seen passion and vanity stamping the livingmagnanimous earth but the earth did not alter her tides and herseasons for that meanwhile stubb the third mate betrayed no such far gazing solicitudes the whales might have made one of their regular soundings not a temporary dive from mere fright and if that were the case stubb as his wont in such cases it seems was resolved to solacethe languishing interval with his pipe he withdrew it fromhis hatband where he always wore it aslant like a feather he loaded it and rammed home the loading with his thumb end but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaperof his hand when tashtego his harpooneer whose eyes had beensetting to windward like two fixed stars suddenly dropped like lightfrom his erect attitude to his seat crying out in a quick phrensyof hurry down down all and give way there they are to a landsman no whale nor any sign of a herring would have beenvisible at that moment nothing but a troubled bit of greenishwhite water and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it and suffusingly blowing off to leeward like the confused scud fromwhite rolling billows the air around suddenly vibrated and tingled as it were like the air over intensely heated plates of iron beneath this atmospheric waving and curling and partially beneatha thin layer of water also the whales were swimming seen in advanceof all the other indications the puffs of vapor they spouted seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders all four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spotof troubled water and air but it bade far to outstrip them it flew on and on as a mass of interblending bubbles bornedown a rapid stream from the hills pull pull my good boys said starbuck in the lowest possiblebut intensest concentrated whisper to his men while the sharpfixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses he did not say much to his crew though nor did his crew say anythingto him only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlinglypierced by one of his peculiar whispers now harsh with command now soft with entreaty how different the loud little king post sing out andsay something my hearties roar and pull my thunderbolts beach me beach me on their black backs boys only do that for me and i ll sign over to you my martha s vineyard plantation boys including wife and children boys lay me on lay me on o lord lord but i shall go stark staring mad see see thatwhite water and so shouting he pulled his hat from his head and stamped up and down on it then picking it up flirted itfar off upon the sea and finally fell to rearing and plungingin the boat s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie look at that chap now philosophically drawled stubb who with hisunlighted short pipe mechanically retained between his teeth at a short distance followed after he s got fits that flask has fits yes give him fits that s the very word pitch fits into em merrily merrily hearts alive pudding for supper you know merry s the word pull babes pull sucklings pull all but what the devil are you hurrying about softly softly and steadily my men only pull and keep pulling nothing more crack all your backbones and bite your knives in two that s all take it easy why don t ye take it easy i say and burst all yourlivers and lungs but what it was that inscrutable ahab said to thattiger yellow crew of his these were words best omitted here for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give earto such words when with tornado brow and eyes of red murder and foam glued lips ahab leaped after his prey meanwhile all the boats tore on the repeated specificallusions of flask to that whale as he called the fictitiousmonster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizinghis boat s bow with its tail these allusions of his were attimes so vivid and life like that they would cause some oneor two of his men to snatch a fearful look over his shoulder but this was against all rule for the oarsmen must putout their eyes and ram a skewer through their necks usages announcing that they must have no organs but ears and no limbs but arms in these critical moments it was a sight full of quick wonder and awe the vast swellsof the omnipotent sea the surging hollow roar they made as they rolled along the eight gunwales like gigantic bowls in aboundless bowling green the brief suspended agony of the boat as it would tip for an instant on the knife like edge of thesharper waves that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill the headlong sled like slide down its other side all these with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers and the shudderinggasps of the oarsmen with the wondrous sight of the ivorypequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails like a wild hen after her screaming brood all this was thrilling not the raw recruit marching from the bosom of his wife intothe fever heat of his first battle not the dead man s ghostencountering the first unknown phantom in the other world neither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions thanthat man does who for the first time finds himself pullinginto the charmed churned circle of the hunted sperm whale the dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming moreand more visible owing to the increasing darkness of the duncloud shadows flung upon the sea the jets of vapor no longer blended but tilted everywhere to right and left the whales seemedseparating their wakes the boats were pulled more apart starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward our sail was now set and with the still rising wind we rushed along the boat going with such madness through the water that the leeoars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being tornfrom the row locks soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist neither ship nor boat to be seen give way men whispered starbuck drawing still further aft the sheetof his sail there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes there s white water again close to spring soon after two cries in quick succession on each side of us denotedthat the other boats had got fast but hardly were they overheard when with a lightning like hurtling whisper starbuck said stand up and queequeg harpoon in hand sprang to his feet though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and deathperil so close to them ahead yet with their eyes on the intensecountenance of the mate in the stern of the boat they knewthat the imminent instant had come they heard too an enormouswallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crestsof enraged serpents that s his hump there there give it to him whispered starbuck a short rushing sound leaped out of the boat it was the darted ironof queequeg then all in one welded commotion came an invisiblepush from astern while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge the sail collapsed and exploded a gush of scalding vapor shot upnear by something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us the whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossedhelter skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall squall whale and harpoon had all blended together and the whale merely grazed by the iron escaped though completely swamped the boat was nearly unharmed swimming round it we picked up the floating oars and lashingthem across the gunwale tumbled back to our places there we sat up to our knees in the sea the water coveringevery rib and plank so that to our downward gazing eyesthe suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us fromthe bottom of the ocean the wind increased to a howl the waves dashed their bucklers together the whole squall roared forked and crackled around uslike a white fire upon the prairie in which unconsumed we were burning immortal in these jaws of death in vain wehailed the other boats as well roar to the live coals downthe chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm meanwhile the driving scud rack and mist grew darkerwith the shadows of night no sign of the ship could be seen the rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat the oars were useless as propellers performing now the officeof life preservers so cutting the lashing of the waterproofmatch keg after many failures starbuck contrived to ignitethe lamp in the lantern then stretching it on a waif pole handed it to queequeg as the standard bearer of this forlorn hope there then he sat holding up that imbecile candle in the heartof that almighty forlornness there then he sat the signand symbol of a man without faith hopelessly holding up hopein the midst of despair wet drenched through and shivering cold despairing of ship or boat we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on the mist still spreadover the sea the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat suddenly queequeg started to his feet hollowing his hand to his ear we all heard a faint creaking as of ropes and yards hitherto muffledby the storm the sound came nearer and nearer the thick mists weredimly parted by a huge vague form affrighted we all sprang intothe sea as the ship at last loomed into view bearing right down uponus within a distance of not much more than its length floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat as for oneinstant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship s bows like a chipat the base of a cataract and then the vast hull rolled over it and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern again we swam for it were dashed against it by the seas and were at last taken up and safely landed on board ere the squall came close to the other boats had cut loosefrom their fish and returned to the ship in good time the ship had given us up but was still cruising if haply it might light upon some token of our perishing an oar or a lance pole chapter the hyenathere are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixedaffair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vastpractical joke though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody s expense but his own however nothing dispirits and nothing seems worth while disputing he bolts down all events all creeds and beliefs and persuasions all hard things visible and invisible never mind how knobby as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints and as for small difficulties and worryings prospects of suddendisaster peril of life and limb all these and death itself seem to him only sly good natured hits and jolly punchesin the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker that odd sort of wayward mood i am speaking of comes over a manonly in some time of extreme tribulation it comes in the very midstof his earnestness so that what just before might have seemed to hima thing most momentous now seems but a part of the general joke there is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easysort of genial desperado philosophy and with it i now regarded thiswhole voyage of the pequod and the great white whale its object queequeg said i when they had dragged me the last man to the deck and i was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water queequeg my fine friend does this sort of thing often happen without much emotion though soaked through just like me he gave meto understand that such things did often happen mr stubb said i turning to that worthy who buttoned up in hisoil jacket was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain mr stubb ithink i have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met our chief mate mr starbuck is by far the most careful and prudent i suppose then that going plump on a flying whale with your sailset in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman s discretion certain i ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a galeoff cape horn mr flask said i turning to little king post who was standingclose by you are experienced in these things and i am not will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery mr flask for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himselfback foremost into death s jaws can t you twist that smaller said flask yes that s the law i should like to see a boat s crew backing water up to a whaleface foremost ha ha the whale would give them squintfor squint mind that here then from three impartial witnesses i had a deliberatestatement of the entire case considering therefore that squallsand capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life considering thatat the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale imust resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boat oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousnessupon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings considering that the particular disaster to our own particular boatwas chiefly to be imputed to starbuck s driving on to his whalealmost in the teeth of a squall and considering that starbuck notwithstanding was famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery considering that i belonged to this uncommonly prudent starbuck s boat and finally considering in what a devil s chase i was implicated touching the white whale taking all things together i say i thought i might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will queequeg said i come along you shall be my lawyer executor and legatee it may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkeringat their last wills and testaments but there are no peoplein the world more fond of that diversion this was the fourthtime in my nautical life that i had done the same thing after the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion i felt all the easier a stone was rolled away from my heart besides all the days i should now live would be as good as the daysthat lazarus lived after his resurrection a supplementaryclean gain of so many months or weeks as the case may be i survived myself my death and burial were locked up in my chest i looked round me tranquilly and contentedly like a quietghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of asnug family vault now then thought i unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock here goes for a cool collected dive at death and destruction and the devil fetch the hindmost chapter ahab s boat and crew fedallah who would have thought it flask cried stubb if i had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat unless maybe to stop the plug hole with my timber toe oh he s a wonderful old man i don t think it so strange after all on that account said flask if his leg were off at the hip now it would bea different thing that would disable him but he has one knee and good part of the other left you know i don t know that my little man i never yet saw him kneel among whale wise people it has often been argued whether considering the paramount importance of his life to thesuccess of the voyage it is right for a whaling captainto jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase so tamerlane s soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried intothe thickest of the fight but with ahab the question assumed a modified aspect considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wightin all times of danger considering that the pursuit of whalesis always under great and extraordinary difficulties that every individual moment indeed then comprises a peril under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to entera whale boat in the hunt as a general thing the joint ownersof the pequod must have plainly thought not ahab well knew that although his friends at home would thinklittle of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmlessvicissitudes of the chase for the sake of being near the sceneof action and giving his orders in person yet for captain ahabto have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regularheadsman in the hunt above all for captain ahab to be suppliedwith five extra men as that same boat s crew he well knewthat such generous conceits never entered the heads of the ownersof the pequod therefore he had not solicited a boat s crewfrom them nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touchingall that matter until cabaco s published discovery the sailors had little foreseen it though to be sure when after being a little while out of port all hands had concludedthe customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service when some time after this ahab was now and then found bestirringhimself in the matter of making thole pins with his own handsfor what was thought to be one of the spare boats and evensolicitously cutting the small wooden skewers which whenthe line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow when all this was observed in him and particularly his solicitudein having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of hisivory limb and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shapingthe thigh board or clumsy cleat as it is sometimes called the horizontal piece in the boat s bow for bracing the kneeagainst in darting or stabbing at the whale when it wasobserved how often he stood up in that boat with his solitaryknee fixed in the semi circular depression in the cleat and with the carpenter s chisel gouged out a little hereand straightened it a little there all these things i say had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time but almost everybody supposed that this particular preparativeheedfulness in ahab must only be with a view to the ultimatechase of moby dick for he had already revealed his intentionto hunt that mortal monster in person but such a suppositiondid by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat screw being assigned to that boat now with the subordinate phantoms what wonder remained soonwaned away for in a whaler wonders soon wane besides now and thensuch unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up fromthe unknown nooks and ash holes of the earth to man these floatingoutlaws of whalers and the ships themselves often pick up such queercastaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks bits of wreck oars whaleboats canoes blown off japanese junks and what not that beelzebub himself might climb up the side and stepdown into the cabin to chat with the captain and it would not createany unsubduable excitement in the forecastle but be all this as it may certain it is that while the subordinatephantoms soon found their place among the crew though still as itwere somehow distinct from them yet that hair turbaned fedallahremained a muffled mystery to the last whence he came in a mannerlyworld like this by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evincedhimself to be linked with ahab s peculiar fortunes nay so faras to have some sort of a half hinted influence heaven knows but it might have been even authority over him all this none knew but one cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning fedallah he wassuch a creature as civilized domestic people in the temperate zoneonly see in their dreams and that but dimly but the like of whomnow and then glide among the unchanging asiatic communities especially the oriental isles to the east of the continent those insulated immemorial unalterable countries which even inthese modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalnessof earth s primal generations when the memory of the firstman was a distinct recollection and all men his descendants unknowing whence he came eyed each other as real phantoms and askedof the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end when though according to genesis the angels indeed consorted withthe daughters of men the devils also add the uncanonical robbins indulged in mundane amours chapter the spirit spoutdays weeks passed and under easy sail the ivory pequodhad slowly swept across four several cruising grounds that off the azores off the cape de verdes on the plate so called being off the mouth of the rio de la plata and the carrol ground an unstaked watery locality southerly from st helena it was while gliding through these latter waters that oneserene and moonlight night when all the waves rolled by likescrolls of silver and by their soft suffusing seethings made what seemed a silvery silence not a solitude on such asilent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the whitebubbles at the bow lit up by the moon it looked celestial seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea fedallah first descried this jet for of these moonlight nights it was his wont to mount to the main mast head and standa look out there with the same precision as if it had been day and yet though herds of whales were seen by night not onewhaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them you may think with what emotions then the seamen beheldthis old oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours his turban and the moon companions in one sky but when after spending his uniform interval there for several successivenights without uttering a single sound when after all this silence his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery moon lit jet every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some wingedspirit had lighted in the rigging and hailed the mortal crew there she blows had the trump of judgment blown they could not have quivered more yet still they felt no terror rather pleasure for though it was a most unwonted hour yet so impressive was the cry and so deliriously exciting that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering walking the deck with quick side lunging strides ahab commandedthe t gallant sails and royals to be set and every stunsail spread the best man in the ship must take the helm then with everymast head manned the piled up craft rolled down before the wind the strange upheaving lifting tendency of the taffrail breezefilling the hollows of so many sails made the buoyant hovering deckto feel like air beneath the feet while still she rushed along as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in her one to mountdirect to heaven the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal and had you watched ahab s face that night you would have thoughtthat in him also two different things were warring while his one liveleg made lively echoes along the deck every stroke of his dead limbsounded like a coffin tap on life and death this old man walked but though the ship so swiftly sped and though from every eye like arrows the eager glances shot yet the silvery jet was nomore seen that night every sailor swore he saw it once but nota second time this midnight spout had almost grown a forgotten thing when some days after lo at the same silent hour it was again announced again it was descried by all but upon making sail to overtake it once more it disappeared as if it had never been and so it servedus night after night till no one heeded it but to wonder at it mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight or starlight as the case might be disappearing again for one whole day or two days or three and somehow seeming at every distinctrepetition to be advancing still further and further in our van this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on nor with the immemorial superstition of their race and in accordance with the preternaturalness as it seemed which in many things invested the pequod were there wantingsome of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried at however remote times or in however far apart latitudesand longitudes that unnearable spout was cast by one selfsame whale and that whale moby dick for a time there reigned too a senseof peculiar dread at this flitting apparition as if it weretreacherously beckoning us on and on in order that the monstermight turn round upon us and rend us at last in the remotestand most savage seas these temporary apprehensions so vague but so awful derived awondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather in which beneath all its blue blandness some thought therelurked a devilish charm as for days and days we voyaged along through seas so wearily lonesomely mild that all space in repugnance to our vengeful errand seemed vacating itselfof life before our urn like prow but at last when turning to the eastward the cape windsbegan howling around us and we rose and fell upon the long troubled seas that are there when the ivory tusked pequod sharplybowed to the blast and gored the dark waves in her madness till like showers of silver chips the foamflakes flew over her bulwarks then all this desolate vacuity of life went away but gave placeto sights more dismal than before close to our bows strange forms in the water darted hither and thitherbefore us while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea ravens andevery morning perched on our stays rows of these birds were seen and spite of our hootings for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp as though they deemed our ship some drifting uninhabited craft a thing appointed to desolation and therefore fit roosting placefor their homeless selves and heaved and heaved still unrestinglyheaved the black sea as if its vast tides were a conscience and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the longsin and suffering it had bred cape of good hope do they call ye rather cape tormentoto as called of yore for long allured by the perfidious silencesthat before had attended us we found ourselves launched into thistormented sea where guilty beings transformed into those fowlsand these fish seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly withoutany haven in store or beat that black air without any horizon but calm snow white and unvarying still directing its fountainof feathers to the sky still beckoning us on from before the solitary jet would at times be descried during all this blackness of the elements ahab though assumingfor the time the almost continual command of the drenched anddangerous deck manifested the gloomiest reserve and more seldomthan ever addressed his mates in tempestuous times like these after everything above and aloft has been secured nothing morecan be done but passively to await the issue of the gale then captain and crew become practical fatalists so with hisivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole and with one handfirmly grasping a shroud ahab for hours and hours would standgazing dead to windward while an occasional squall of sleetor snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together meantime the crew driven from the forward part of the shipby the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist and the betterto guard against the leaping waves each man had slippedhimself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail in whichhe swung as in a loosened belt few or no words were spoken and the silent ship as if manned by painted sailors in wax day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladnessof the demoniac waves by night the same muteness of humanitybefore the shrieks of the ocean prevailed still in silence the menswung in the bowlines still wordless ahab stood up to the blast even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seekthat repose in his hammock never could starbuck forget the oldman s aspect when one night going down into the cabin to markhow the barometer stood he saw him with closed eyes sittingstraight in his floor screwed chair the rain and half meltedsleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat on the table beside him lay unrolled one of those chartsof tides and currents which have previously been spoken of his lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand though the body was erect the head was thrown back so thatthe closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell talethat swung from a beam in the ceiling the cabin compass is called the tell tale because withoutgoing to the compass at the helm the captain while below can inform himself of the course of the ship terrible old man thought starbuck with a shudder sleeping in this gale still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose chapter the albatrosssouth eastward from the cape off the distant crozetts a good cruising ground for right whalemen a sail loomed ahead the goney albatross by name as she slowly drew nigh from my lofty perch at the fore mast head i had a good viewof that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries a whaler at sea and long absent from home as if the waves had been fullers this craft was bleachedlike the skeleton of a stranded walrus all down her sides this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branchesof trees furred over with hoar frost only her lower sails were set a wild sight it was to see her long bearded look outs at those threemast heads they seemed clad in the skins of beasts so torn andbepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast they swayed and swungover a fathomless sea and though when the ship slowly glidedclose under our stern we six men in the air came so nigh to eachother that we might almost have leaped from the mast heads of oneship to those of the other yet those forlorn looking fishermen mildly eyeing us as they passed said not one word to our ownlook outs while the quarter deck hail was being heard from below ship ahoy have ye seen the white whale but as the strange captain leaning over the pallid bulwarks was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth it somehowfell from his hand into the sea and the wind now rising amain he in vain strove to make himself heard without it meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between us while in various silent ways the seamen of the pequod were evincingtheir observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mentionof the white whale s name to another ship ahab for a moment paused it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boatto board the stranger had not the threatening wind forbade but taking advantage of his windward position he again seizedhis trumpet and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel wasa nantucketer and shortly bound home he loudly hailed ahoy there this is the pequod bound round the world tell them to addressall future letters to the pacific ocean and this time three years if i am not at home tell them to address them to at that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed and instantly then in accordance with their singular ways shoals of smallharmless fish that for some days before had been placidly swimmingby our side darted away with what seemed shuddering fins and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger s flanks though in the course of his continual voyagings ahab must oftenbefore have noticed a similar sight yet to any monomaniac man the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings swim away from me do ye murmured ahab gazing over into the water there seemed but little in the words but the tone conveyed more of deephelpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced but turning to the steersman who thus far had been holding the shipin the wind to diminish her headway he cried out in his old lionvoice up helm keep her off round the world round the world there is much in that sound to inspireproud feelings but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started where those that we left behind secure were all the time before us were this world an endless plain and by sailing eastward we couldfor ever reach new distances and discover sights more sweet and strangethan any cyclades or islands of king solomon then there were promisein the voyage but in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that some time or other swims before all human hearts while chasing such over this round globe they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed chapter the gamthe ostensible reason why ahab did not go on board of the whalerwe had spoken was this the wind and sea betokened storms but even had this not been the case he would not after all perhaps have boarded her judging by his subsequent conduct onsimilar occasions if so it had been that by the process of hailing he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put for as it eventually turned out he cared not to consort even for five minutes with any stranger captain except he couldcontribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought but all this might remain inadequately estimated were notsomething said here of the peculiar usages of whaling vesselswhen meeting each other in foreign seas and especially ona common cruising ground if two strangers crossing the pine barrens in new york state or the equally desolate salisbury plain in england if casuallyencountering each other in such inhospitable wilds these twain for the life of them cannot well avoid a mutual salutation and stopping for a moment to interchange the news and perhaps sitting down for a while and resting in concert then how much more natural that upon the illimitable pine barrensand salisbury plains of the sea two whaling vessels descryingeach other at the ends of the earth off lone fanning s island or the far away king s mills how much more natural i say that undersuch circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails but come into still closer more friendly and sociable contact and especially would this seem to be a matter of course in the caseof vessels owned in one seaport and whose captains officers and not a few of the men are personally known to each other and consequently have all sorts of dear domestic thingsto talk about for the long absent ship the outward bounder perhaps has letters on board at any rate she will be sure to let herhave some papers of a date a year or two later than the lastone on her blurred and thumb worn files and in return forthat courtesy the outward bound ship would receive the latestwhaling intelligence from the cruising ground to which shemay be destined a thing of the utmost importance to her and in degree all this will hold true concerning whaling vesselscrossing each other s track on the cruising ground itself even though they are equally long absent from home for oneof them may have received a transfer of letters from some third and now far remote vessel and some of those letters may befor the people of the ship she now meets besides they wouldexchange the whaling news and have an agreeable chat for not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising froma common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils nor would difference of country make any very essential difference that is so long as both parties speak one language as is the casewith americans and english though to be sure from the small numberof english whalers such meetings do not very often occur and when theydo occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them for your englishman is rather reserved and your yankee he does notfancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself besides the englishwhalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiorityover the american whalers regarding the long lean nantucketer with his nondescript provincialisms as a sort of sea peasant butwhere this superiority in the english whaleman does really consist it would be hard to say seeing that the yankees in one day collectively kill more whales than all the english collectively in ten years but this is a harmless little foible in the english whale hunters whichthe nantucketer does not take much to heart probably because he knowsthat he has a few foibles himself so then we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea the whalers have most reason to be sociable and they are so whereas some merchant ships crossing each other s wake in themid atlantic will oftentimes pass on without so much as a singleword of recognition mutually cutting each other on the high seas like a brace of dandies in broadway and all the time indulging perhaps in finical criticism upon each other s rig as for men of war when they chance to meet at sea they firstgo through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings such a ducking of ensigns that there does not seem to be muchright down hearty good will and brotherly love about it at all as touching slave ships meeting why they are in such aprodigious hurry they run away from each other as soon as possible and as for pirates when they chance to cross each other scross bones the first hail is how many skulls the same way that whalers hail how many barrels and that question once answered pirates straightway steer apart for they are infernal villains on both sides and don t liketo see overmuch of each other s villanous likenesses but look at the godly honest unostentatious hospitable sociable free and easy whaler what does the whaler do when she meetsanother whaler in any sort of decent weather she has a gam a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they neverheard of the name even and if by chance they should hear of it they only grin at it and repeat gamesome stuff about spouters and blubber boilers and such like pretty exclamations why it is that all merchant seamen and also all pirates andman of war s men and slave ship sailors cherish such a scornfulfeeling towards whale ships this is a question it would be hardto answer because in the case of pirates say i should like to knowwhether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it it sometimes ends in uncommon elevation indeed but only at the gallows and besides when a man is elevated in that odd fashion he hasno proper foundation for his superior altitude hence i conclude that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on but what is a gam you might wear out your index finger runningup and down the columns of dictionaries and never find the word dr johnson never attained to that erudition noah webster sark does not hold it nevertheless this same expressive wordhas now for many years been in constant use among some fifteenthousand true born yankees certainly it needs a definition and should be incorporated into the lexicon with that view let me learnedly define it gam noun a social meeting of two or more whaleships generally ona cruising ground when after exchanging hails they exchangevisits by boats crews the two captains remaining for the time on board of one ship and the two chief mates on the other there is another little item about gamming which must notbe forgotten here all professions have their own littlepeculiarities of detail so has the whale fishery in a pirate man of war or slave ship when the captain is rowed anywherein his boat he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable sometimes cushioned seat there and often steers himself with a prettylittle milliner s tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons but the whale boat has no seat astern no sofa of that sort whatever and no tiller at all high times indeed if whaling captains were wheeledabout the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs and as for a tiller the whale boat never admits of any such effeminacy and therefore as in gamming a complete boat s crew must leave the ship and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion and the captain having no place to sit in is pulled off to his visit all standinglike a pine tree and often you will notice that being consciousof the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him fromthe sides of the two ships this standing captain is all aliveto the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs nor is this any very easy matter for in his rear is the immenseprojecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small ofhis back the after oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front he is thus completely wedged before and behind and can onlyexpand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs but a sudden violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth merely make a spread angle of two poles and you cannot stand them up then again it would never do in plain sight of the world s riveted eyes it would never do i say for this straddling captain to be seensteadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anythingwith his hands indeed as token of his entire buoyant self command he generally carries his hands in his trowsers pockets but perhaps beinggenerally very large heavy hands he carries them there for ballast nevertheless there have occurred instances well authenticated ones too where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two in a sudden squall say to seize hold of the nearest oarsman s hair and hold on there like grim death chapter the town ho s story as told at the golden inn the cape of good hope and all the watery region round about there is much like some noted four corners of a great highway where youmeet more travellers than in any other part it was not very long after speaking the goney that anotherhomeward bound whaleman the town ho was encountered she was manned almost wholly by polynesians in the short gam thatensued she gave us strong news of moby dick to some the generalinterest in the white whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstanceof the town ho s story which seemed obscurely to involve with the whalea certain wondrous inverted visitation of one of those so calledjudgments of god which at times are said to overtake some men this latter circumstance with its own particular accompaniments forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about tobe narrated never reached the ears of captain ahab or his mates for that secret part of the story was unknown to the captainof the town ho himself it was the private property of threeconfederate white seamen of that ship one of whom it seems communicated it to tashtego with romish injunctions of secrecy but the following night tashtego rambled in his sleep and revealedso much of it in that way that when he was wakened he could notwell withhold the rest nevertheless so potent an influence didthis thing have on those seamen in the pequod who came to the fullknowledge of it and by such a strange delicacy to call it so were they governed in this matter that they kept the secret amongthemselves so that it never transpired abaft the pequod s main mast interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the storyas publicly narrated on the ship the whole of this strange affairi now proceed to put on lasting record the ancient whale cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast head still used by whalemen in hunting the famous gallipagos terrapin for my humor s sake i shall preserve the style in which i once narratedit at lima to a lounging circle of my spanish friends one saint s eve smoking upon the thick gilt tiled piazza of the golden inn of thosefine cavaliers the young dons pedro and sebastian were on the closerterms with me and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put and which are duly answered at the time some two years prior to my first learning the events which i am aboutrehearsing to you gentlemen the town ho sperm whaler of nantucket was cruising in your pacific here not very many days sail eastward fromthe eaves of this good golden inn she was somewhere to the northward ofthe line one morning upon handling the pumps according to daily usage it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common they supposed a sword fish had stabbed her gentlemen but the captain having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaitedhim in those latitudes and therefore being very averse to quit them and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous though indeed they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as waspossible in rather heavy weather the ship still continued her cruisings the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals but no goodluck came more days went by and not only was the leak yet undiscovered but it sensibly increased so much so that now taking some alarm the captain making all sail stood away for the nearest harbor amongthe islands there to have his hull hove out and repaired though no small passage was before her yet if the commonestchance favoured he did not at all fear that his ship would founderby the way because his pumps were of the best and being periodicallyrelieved at them those six and thirty men of his could easilykeep the ship free never mind if the leak should double on her in truth well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by veryprosperous breezes the town ho had all but certainly arrived in perfectsafety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality had it not been for the brutal overbearing of radney the mate a vineyarder and the bitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt a lakeman and desperado from buffalo lakeman buffalo pray what is a lakeman and where is buffalo said don sebastian rising in his swinging mat of grass on the eastern shore of our lake erie don but i craveyour courtesy may be you shall soon hear further of all that now gentlemen in square sail brigs and three masted ships well nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of yourold callao to far manilla this lakeman in the land locked heartof our america had yet been nurtured by all those agrarianfreebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean for in their interflowing aggregate those grand fresh water seasof ours erie and ontario and huron and superior and michigan possess an ocean like expansiveness with many of the ocean snoblest traits with many of its rimmed varieties of races andof climes they contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles even as the polynesian waters do in large part are shored by twogreat contrasting nations as the atlantic is they furnish longmaritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the east dotted all round their banks here and there are frowned uponby batteries and by the goat like craggy guns of lofty mackinaw they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories at intervals they yield their beaches to wild barbarians whose red paintedfaces flash from out their peltry wigwams for leagues and leaguesare flanked by ancient and unentered forests where the gauntpines stand like serried lines of kings in gothic genealogies those same woods harboring wild afric beasts of prey and silkencreatures whose exported furs give robes to tartar emperors they mirror the paved capitals of buffalo and cleveland as well aswinnebago villages they float alike the full rigged merchant ship the armed cruiser of the state the steamer and the beech canoe they are swept by borean and dismasting blasts as direfulas any that lash the salted wave they know what shipwrecks are for out of sight of land however inland they have drownedfull many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew thus gentlemen though an inlander steelkilt was wild ocean born and wild ocean nurtured as much of an audacious mariner as any and for radney though in his infancy he may have laid himdown on the lone nantucket beach to nurse at his maternal sea though in after life he had long followed our austereatlantic and your contemplative pacific yet was he quiteas vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman fresh from the latitudes of buckhorn handled bowie knives yetwas this nantucketer a man with some good hearted traits and this lakeman a mariner who though a sort of devil indeed might yet by inflexible firmness only tempered by that commondecency of human recognition which is the meanest slave s right thus treated this steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile at all events he had proved so thus far but radney was doomedand made mad and steelkilt but gentlemen you shall hear it was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prowfor her island haven that the town ho s leak seemed again increasing but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day you must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our atlantic for example some skippers think little of pumping their whole wayacross it though of a still sleepy night should the officer of the deckhappen to forget his duty in that respect the probability would be thathe and his shipmates would never again remember it on account of allhands gently subsiding to the bottom nor in the solitary and savageseas far from you to the westward gentlemen is it altogether unusualfor ships to keep clanging at their pump handles in full chorus evenfor a voyage of considerable length that is if it lie along a tolerablyaccessible coast or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them it is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way partof those waters some really landless latitude that her captain beginsto feel a little anxious much this way had it been with the town ho so when her leakwas found gaining once more there was in truth some small concernmanifested by several of her company especially by radney the mate he commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted sheeted home anew and every way expanded to the breeze now this radney i suppose was as little of a coward and as little inclined to any sortof nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can convenientlyimagine gentlemen therefore when he betrayed this imagine solicitude about the safety of the ship some of the seamen declaredthat it was only on account of his being a part owner in her so when they were working that evening at the pumps there was on thishead no small gamesomeness slily going on among them as they stoodwith their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water clear as any mountain spring gentlemen that bubbling from the pumpsran across the deck and poured itself out in steady spouts atthe lee scupper holes now as you well know it is not seldom the case in thisconventional world of ours watery or otherwise that when a personplaced in command over his fellow men finds one of them to bevery significantly his superior in general pride of manhood straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislikeand bitterness and if he had a chance he will pull down and pulverizethat subaltern s tower and make a little heap of dust of it be this conceit of mine as it may gentlemen at all eventssteelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a roman and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of yourlast viceroy s snorting charger and a brain and a heart and a soul in him gentlemen which had made steelkilt charlemagne had he been born son to charlemagne s father but radney the mate was ugly as a mule yet as hardy as stubborn as malicious he did not love steelkilt and steelkilt knew it espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pumpwith the rest the lakeman affected not to notice him but unawed went on with his gay banterings aye aye my merry lads it s a lively leak this hold a cannikin one of ye and let s have a taste by the lord it s worth bottling i tell ye what men old rad s investment must go for it he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home the fact is boys that sword fish only began the job he s comeback again with a gang of ship carpenters saw fish and file fish and what not and the whole posse of em are now hard at workcutting and slashing at the bottom making improvements i suppose if old rad were here now i d tell him to jump overboard and scatter em they re playing the devil with his estate i can tell him but he s a simple old soul rad and a beauty too boys they saythe rest of his property is invested in looking glasses i wonderif he d give a poor devil like me the model of his nose damn your eyes what s that pump stopping for roared radney pretending not to have heard the sailors talk thunder away at it aye aye sir said steelkilt merry as a cricket lively boys lively now and with that the pump clangedlike fifty fire engines the men tossed their hats off to it and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heardwhich denotes the fullest tension of life s utmost energies quitting the pump at last with the rest of his band the lakemanwent forward all panting and sat himself down on the windlass his face fiery red his eyes bloodshot and wiping the profuse sweatfrom his brow now what cozening fiend it was gentlemen that possessedradney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state i know not but so it happened intolerably striding along the deck the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks and also a shovel and remove some offensive matters consequent uponallowing a pig to run at large now gentlemen sweeping a ship s deck at sea is a piece of householdwork which in all times but raging gales is regularly attendedto every evening it has been known to be done in the case of shipsactually foundering at the time such gentlemen is the inflexibilityof sea usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces but in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive provinceof the boys if boys there be aboard besides it was the strongermen in the town ho that had been divided into gangs taking turnsat the pumps and being the most athletic seaman of them all steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs consequently he should have been freed from any trivial businessnot connected with truly nautical duties such being the casewith his comrades i mention all these particulars so that youmay understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men but there was more than this the order about the shovel was almostas plainly meant to sting and insult steelkilt as though radneyhad spat in his face any man who has gone sailor in a whale shipwill understand this and all this and doubtless much more the lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command but as he sat still for a moment and as he steadfastlylooked into the mate s malignant eye and perceived the stacksof powder casks heaped up in him and the slow match silentlyburning along towards them as he instinctively saw all this that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeperpassionateness in any already ireful being a repugnance most felt when felt at all by really valiant men even when aggrieved this nameless phantom feeling gentlemen stole over steelkilt therefore in his ordinary tone only a little broken by the bodilyexhaustion he was temporarily in he answered him saying thatsweeping the deck was not his business and he would not do it and then without at all alluding to the shovel he pointedto three lads as the customary sweepers who not beingbilleted at the pumps had done little or nothing all day to this radney replied with an oath in a most domineeringand outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lakeman with an upliftedcooper s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweatingsteelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat till at last the incensed radney shook the hammer within a fewinches of his face furiously commanding him to do his bidding steelkilt rose and slowly retreating round the windlass steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer deliberately repeated his intention not to obey seeing however that his forbearance had not the slightest effect by an awfuland unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned offthe foolish and infatuated man but it was to no purpose and in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass when resolved at last no longer to retreat bethinking himthat he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor the lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer mr radney i will not obey you take that hammer away or lookto yourself but the predestinated mate coming still closer to him where the lakeman stood fixed now shook the heavy hammer within an inchof his teeth meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions retreating not the thousandth part of an inch stabbing him in the eyewith the unflinching poniard of his glance steelkilt clenching hisright hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back told his persecutorthat if the hammer but grazed his cheek he steelkilt would murder him but gentlemen the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods immediately the hammer touched the cheek the next instant the lowerjaw of the mate was stove in his head he fell on the hatch spoutingblood like a whale ere the cry could go aft steelkilt was shaking one of the backstaysleading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standingtheir mastheads they were both canallers canallers cried don pedro we have seen many whaleshipsin our harbors but never heard of your canallers pardon who andwhat are they canallers don are the boatmen belonging to our granderie canal you must have heard of it nay senor hereabouts in this dull warm most lazy and hereditary land we know but little of your vigorous north aye well then don refill my cup your chicha s very fine and ere proceeding further i will tell ye what our canallers are for such information may throw side light upon my story for three hundred and sixty miles gentlemen through the entire breadthof the state of new york through numerous populous cities and mostthriving villages through long dismal uninhabited swamps and affluent cultivated fields unrivalled for fertility by billiard roomand bar room through the holy of holies of great forests on roman archesover indian rivers through sun and shade by happy hearts or broken through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble mohawk counties and especially by rows of snow white chapels whose spires standalmost like milestones flows one continual stream of venetianlycorrupt and often lawless life there s your true ashantee gentlemen there howl your pagans where you ever find them next door to you under the long flung shadow and the snug patronizing lee of churches for by some curious fatality as it is often noted of your metropolitanfreebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice so sinners gentlemen most abound in holiest vicinities is that a friar passing said don pedro looking downwardsinto the crowded plazza with humorous concern well for our northern friend dame isabella s inquisition wanesin lima laughed don sebastian proceed senor a moment pardon cried another of the company in the nameof all us limeese i but desire to express to you sir sailor that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substitutingpresent lima for distant venice in your corrupt comparison oh do not bow and look surprised you know the proverb all alongthis coast corrupt as lima it but bears out your saying too churches more plentiful than billiard tables and for ever open and corrupt as lima so too venice i have been there the holycity of the blessed evangelist st mark st dominic purge it your cup thanks here i refill now you pour out again freely depicted in his own vocation gentlemen the canallerwould make a fine dramatic hero so abundantly and picturesquelywicked is he like mark antony for days and days along hisgreen turfed flowery nile he indolently floats openly toyingwith his red cheeked cleopatra ripening his apricot thigh uponthe sunny deck but ashore all this effeminacy is dashed the brigandish guise which the canaller so proudly sports his slouched and gaily ribboned hat betoken his grand features a terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities once a vagabond on his own canal i have received good turnsfrom one of these canallers i thank him heartily would fain benot ungrateful but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualitiesof your man of violence that at times he has as stiff an armto back a poor stranger in a strait as to plunder a wealthy one in sum gentlemen what the wildness of this canal life is is emphatically evinced by this that our wild whale fishery contains somany of its most finished graduates and that scarce any race of mankind except sydney men are so much distrusted by our whaling captains nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter that tomany thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line the probationary life of the grand canal furnishes the sole transitionbetween quietly reaping in a christian corn field and recklesslyploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas i see i see impetuously exclaimed don pedro spilling hischicha upon his silvery ruffles no need to travel the world s one lima i had thought now that at your temperatenorth the generations were cold and holy as the hills but the story i had left off gentlemen where the lakeman shook the backstay hardly had he done so when he was surrounded by the three juniormates and the four harpooneers who all crowded him to the deck but sliding down the ropes like baleful comets the two canallersrushed into the uproar and sought to drag their man out of it towardsthe forecastle others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt and a twisted turmoil ensued while standing out of harm s way the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale pike callingupon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel and smokehim along to the quarter deck at intervals he ran close up tothe revolving border of the confusion and prying into the heart of itwith his pike sought to prick out the object of his resentment but steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck where hastily slewingabout three or four large casks in a line with the windlass these sea parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade come out of that ye pirates roared the captain now menacingthem with a pistol in each hand just brought to him by the steward come out of that ye cut throats steelkilt leaped on the barricade and striding up and down there defied the worst the pistols could do but gave the captainto understand distinctly that his steelkilt s death wouldbe the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true the captain a little desisted but still commanded the insurgentsinstantly to return to their duty will you promise not to touch us if we do demanded their ringleader turn to turn to i make no promise to your duty do you want to sink the ship by knocking off at a time like this turn to and he once more raised a pistol sink the ship cried steelkilt aye let her sink not a man of us turns to unless you swear not to raise a rope yarnagainst us what say ye men turning to his comrades a fierce cheer was their response the lakeman now patrolled the barricade all the while keepinghis eye on the captain and jerking out such sentences as these it s not our fault we didn t want it i told him to takehis hammer away it was boy s business he might have knownme before this i told him not to prick the buffalo i believe i have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw ain t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there men look to those handspikes my hearties captain by god look to yourself say the word don t be a fool forget it all we are ready to turn to treat us decently and we re your men but we won t be flogged turn to i make no promises turn to i say look ye now cried the lakeman flinging out his arm towards him there are a few of us here and i am one of them who have shippedfor the cruise d ye see now as you well know sir we can claimour discharge as soon as the anchor is down so we don t want a row it s not our interest we want to be peaceable we are ready to work but we won t be flogged turn to roared the captain steelkilt glanced round him a moment and then said i tellyou what it is now captain rather than kill ye and be hungfor such a shabby rascal we won t lift a hand against ye unlessye attack us but till you say the word about not flogging us we don t do a hand s turn down into the forecastle then down with ye i ll keep ye theretill ye re sick of it down ye go shall we cried the ringleader to his men most of themwere against it but at length in obedience to steelkilt they preceded him down into their dark den growlingly disappearing like bears into a cave as the lakeman s bare head was just level with the planks the captain and his posse leaped the barricade and rapidly drawingover the slide of the scuttle planted their group of hands upon it and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlockbelonging to the companionway then opening the slide a little the captain whispered something downthe crack closed it and turned the key upon them ten in number leaving on deck some twenty or more who thus far had remained neutral all night a wide awake watch was kept by all the officers forward and aft especially about the forecastle scuttle andfore hatchway at which last place it was feared the insurgentsmight emerge after breaking through the bulkhead below but the hours of darkness passed in peace the men who stillremained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps whose clinkingand clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismallyresounded through the ship at sunrise the captain went forward and knocking on the deck summoned the prisoners to work but with a yell they refused water was then lowered down to them and a couple of handfulsof biscuit were tossed after it when again turning the key uponthem and pocketing it the captain returned to the quarter deck twice every day for three days this was repeated but on the fourthmorning a confused wrangling and then a scuffling was heard as the customary summons was delivered and suddenly four menburst up from the forecastle saying they were ready to turn to the fetid closeness of the air and a famishing diet united perhapsto some fears of ultimate retribution had constrained them tosurrender at discretion emboldened by this the captain reiteratedhis demand to the rest but steelkilt shouted up to him a terrifichint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged on the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up intothe air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them only three were left better turn to now said the captain with a heartless jeer shut us up again will ye cried steelkilt oh certainly said the captain and the key clicked it was at this point gentlemen that enraged by the defectionof seven of his former associates and stung by the mocking voicethat had last hailed him and maddened by his long entombment in a placeas black as the bowels of despair it was then that steelkilt proposedto the two canallers thus far apparently of one mind with him to burstout of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison and armedwith their keen mincing knives long crescentic heavy implementswith a handle at each end run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail and if by any devilishness of desperation possible seize the ship for himself he would do this he said whether they joined himor not that was the last night he should spend in that den but the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two they swore they were ready for that or for any other mad thing for anything in short but a surrender and what was more they eachinsisted upon being the first man on deck when the time to makethe rush should come but to this their leader as fiercely objected reserving that priority for himself particularly as his two comradeswould not yield the one to the other in the matter and both of themcould not be first for the ladder would but admit one man at a time and here gentlemen the foul play of these miscreants must come out upon hearing the frantic project of their leader each in his ownseparate soul had suddenly lighted it would seem upon the samepiece of treachery namely to be the foremost in breaking out in order to be the first of the three though the last of the ten to surrender and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardonsuch conduct might merit but when steelkilt made known hisdetermination still to lead them to the last they in some way by some subtle chemistry of villany mixed their before secrettreacheries together and when their leader fell into a doze verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences and bound the sleeper with cords and gagged him with cords and shrieked out for the captain at midnight thinking murder at hand and smelling in the dark for the blood he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle in a few minutes the scuttle was opened and bound hand and foot the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the airby his perfidious allies who at once claimed the honorof securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder but all these were collared and dragged along the deck likedead cattle and side by side were seized up into the mizzen rigging like three quarters of meat and there they hung till morning damn ye cried the captain pacing to and fro before them the vultures would not touch ye ye villains at sunrise he summoned all hands and separating those who had rebelledfrom those who had taken no part in the mutiny he told the formerthat he had a good mind to flog them all round thought upon the while he would do so he ought to justice demanded it but for the present considering their timely surrender he would let them go with a reprimand which he accordingly administered in the vernacular but as for you ye carrion rogues turning to the three menin the rigging for you i mean to mince ye up for the try pots and seizing a rope he applied it with all his might to the backsof the two traitors till they yelled no more but lifelessly hungtheir heads sideways as the two crucified thieves are drawn my wrist is sprained with ye he cried at last but there is stillrope enough left for you my fine bantam that wouldn t give up take that gag from his mouth and let us hear what he cansay for himself for a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motionof his cramped jaws and then painfully twisting round his head said in a sort of hiss what i say is this and mind it well if you flog me i murder you say ye so then see how ye frighten me and the captain drewoff with the rope to strike best not hissed the lakeman but i must and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke steelkilt here hissed out something inaudible to all butthe captain who to the amazement of all hands started back paced the deck rapidly two or three times and then suddenlythrowing down his rope said i won t do it let him go cut him down d ye hear but as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order a pale man with a bandaged head arrested them radney the chief mate ever since the blow he had lain in his berth but that morning hearing the tumult on the deck he had crept out and thus farhad watched the whole scene such was the state of his mouth that he could hardly speak but mumbling something about hisbeing willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe you are a coward hissed the lakeman so i am but take that the mate was in the very actof striking when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm he paused and then pausing no more made good his word spite of steelkilt s threat whatever that might have been the three men were then cut down all hands were turned to and sullenly worked by the moody seamen the iron pumpsclanged as before just after dark that day when one watch had retired below a clamor was heard in the forecastle and the two trembling traitorsrunning up besieged the cabin door saying they durst not consortwith the crew entreaties cuffs and kicks could not drive them back so at their own instance they were put down in the ship s runfor salvation still no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest on the contrary it seemed that mainly at steelkilt s instigation they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness obey all ordersto the last and when the ship reached port desert her in a body but in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage they allagreed to another thing namely not to sing out for whales in case any should be discovered for spite of her leak and spite of all her other perils the town ho still maintained hermast heads and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fishthat moment as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground and radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jawof the whale but though the lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt thissort of passiveness in their conduct he kept his own counsel at least till all was over concerning his own proper and privaterevenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart he was in radney the chief mate s watch and as if the infatuatedman sought to run more than half way to meet his doom after thescene at the rigging he insisted against the express counselof the captain upon resuming the head of his watch at night upon this and one or two other circumstances steelkilt systematicallybuilt the plan of his revenge during the night radney had an unseaman like way of sittingon the bulwarks of the quarterdeck and leaning his arm uponthe gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there a littleabove the ship s side in this attitude it was well known he sometimes dozed there was a considerable vacancy betweenthe boat and the ship and down between this was the sea steelkilt calculated his time and found that his next trickat the helm would come round at two o clock in the morningof the third day from that in which he had been betrayed at his leisure he employed the interval in braiding somethingvery carefully in his watches below what are you making there said a shipmate what do you think what does it look like like a lanyard for your bag but it s an odd one seems to me yes rather oddish said the lakeman holding it at arm s lengthbefore him but i think it will answer shipmate i haven tenough twine have you any but there was none in the forecastle then i must get some from old rad and he rose to go aft you don t mean to go a begging to him said a sailor why not do you think he won t do me a turn when it sto help himself in the end shipmate and going to the mate he looked at him quietly and asked him for some twine to mendhis hammock it was given him neither twine nor lanyard wereseen again but the next night an iron ball closely netted partly rolled from the pocket of the lakeman s monkey jacket as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow twenty four hours after his trick at the silent helm nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always readydug to the seaman s hand that fatal hour was then to come and in the fore ordaining soul of steelkilt the mate was alreadystark and stretched as a corpse with his forehead crushed in but gentlemen a fool saved the would be murderer fromthe bloody deed he had planned yet complete revenge he had and without being the avenger for by a mysterious fatality heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands intoits own the damning thing he would have done it was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morningof the second day when they were washing down the decks that a stupid teneriffe man drawing water in the main chains all at once shouted out there she rolls there she rolls jesu what a whale it was moby dick moby dick cried don sebastian st dominic sir sailor but do whales have christenings whom call you moby dick a very white and famous and most deadly immortal monster don but that would be too long a story how how cried all the young spaniards crowding nay dons dons nay nay i cannot rehearse that now let me get more into the air sirs the chicha the chicha cried don pedro our vigorous friendlooks faint fill up his empty glass no need gentlemen one moment and i proceed now gentlemen so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship forgetful of the compact among the crew in the excitement of the moment the teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voicefor the monster though for some little time past it had been plainlybeheld from the three sullen mast heads all was now a phrensy the white whale the white whale was the cry from captain mates and harpooneers who undeterred by fearful rumours were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish while the dogged crew eyed askance and with curses the appalling beautyof the vast milky mass that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea gentlemen a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted the mutineer was the bowsman of the mate and when fast to a fish it was his duty to sit next him while radney stood up with his lancein the prow and haul in or slacken the line at the word of command moreover when the four boats were lowered the mate s got the start and none howled more fiercely with delight than did steelkilt as he strained at his oar after a stiff pull their harpooneergot fast and spear in hand radney sprang to the bow he was always a furious man it seems in a boat and now hisbandaged cry was to beach him on the whale s topmost back nothing loath his bowsman hauled him up and up through a blindingfoam that blent two whitenesses together till of a sudden the boatstruck as against a sunken ledge and keeling over spilled out thestanding mate that instant as he fell on the whale s slippery back the boat righted and was dashed aside by the swell while radneywas tossed over into the sea on the other flank of the whale he struck out through the spray and for an instant was dimly seenthrough that veil wildly seeking to remove himself from the eyeof moby dick but the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom seized the swimmer between his jaws and rearing high up with him plunged headlong again and went down meantime at the first tap of the boat s bottom the lakemanhad slackened the line so as to drop astern from the whirlpool calmly looking on he thought his own thoughts but a sudden terrific downward jerking of the boat quickly brought his knife to the line he cut it and the whale was free but at some distance moby dick rose again with some tatters of radney s redwoollen shirt caught in the teeth that had destroyed him all four boats gave chase again but the whale eluded them and finally wholly disappeared in good time the town ho reached her port a savage solitary place where no civilized creature resided there headed by the lakeman all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted amongthe palms eventually as it turned out seizing a large doublewar canoe of the savages and setting sail for some other harbor the ship s company being reduced to but a handful the captain calledupon the islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heavingdown the ship to stop the leak but to such unresting vigilance overtheir dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated both by night and by day and so extreme was the hard work they underwent that upon the vessel being ready again for sea they were in sucha weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with themin so heavy a vessel after taking counsel with his officers he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible loaded and ranout his two cannon from the bows stacked his muskets on the poop and warning the islanders not to approach the ship at their peril took one man with him and setting the sail of his best whale boat steered straight before the wind for tahiti five hundred miles distant to procure a reinforcement to his crew on the fourth day of the sail a large canoe was descried which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals he steered away from it but the savage craft bore down on him and soon the voice of steelkilt hailed him to heave to or he would run him under water the captain presented a pistol with one foot on each prow of the yoked war canoes the lakemanlaughed him to scorn assuring him that if the pistol so muchas clicked in the lock he would bury him in bubbles and foam what do you want of me cried the captain where are you bound and for what are you bound demanded steelkilt no lies i am bound to tahiti for more men very good let me board you a moment i come in peace with that he leaped from the canoe swam to the boat and climbing the gunwale stood face to face with the captain cross your arms sir throw back your head now repeat after me as soon as steelkilt leaves me i swear to beach this boaton yonder island and remain there six days if i do not may lightning strike me a pretty scholar laughed the lakeman adios senor and leaping into the sea he swam back to his comrades watching the boat till it was fairly beached and drawn up to the rootsof the cocoa nut trees steelkilt made sail again and in due time arrivedat tahiti his own place of destination there luck befriended him two ships were about to sail for france and were providentiallyin want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed they embarked and so for ever got the start of their former captain had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution some ten days after the french ships sailed the whale boat arrived and the captain was forced to enlist some of the morecivilized tahitians who had been somewhat used to the sea chartering a small native schooner he returned with them to his vessel and finding all right there again resumed his cruisings where steelkilt now is gentlemen none know but upon the islandof nantucket the widow of radney still turns to the sea which refusesto give up its dead still in dreams sees the awful white whalethat destroyed him are you through said don sebastian quietly i am don then i entreat you tell me if to the best of your own convictions this your story is in substance really true it is so passing wonderful did you get it from an unquestionable source bear with me if iseem to press also bear with all of us sir sailor for we all join indon sebastian s suit cried the company with exceeding interest is there a copy of the holy evangelists in the golden inn gentlemen nay said don sebastian but i know a worthy priest near by who will quickly procure one for me i go for it but are youwell advised this may grow too serious will you be so good as to bring the priest also don though there are no auto da fe s in lima now said one of the companyto another i fear our sailor friend runs risks of the archiepiscopacy let us withdraw more out of the moonlight i see no need of this excuse me for running after you don sebastian but may ialso beg that you will be particular in procuring the largestsized evangelists you can this is the priest he brings you the evangelists said don sebastian gravely returning with a tall and solemn figure let me remove my hat now venerable priest further into the light and hold the holy book before me that i may touch it so help me heaven and on my honor the story i havetold ye gentlemen is in substance and its great items true i know it to be true it happened on this ball i trod the ship i knew the crew i have seen and talked with steelkilt sincethe death of radney chapter of the monstrous pictures of whalesi shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas something like the true form of the whale as he actually appearsto the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whaleis moored alongside the whaleship so that he can be fairly steppedupon there it may be worth while therefore previously to advertto those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down tothe present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman it is time to set the world right in this matter by proving suchpictures of the whale all wrong it may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions willbe found among the oldest hindoo egyptian and grecian sculptures for ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marblepanellings of temples the pedestals of statues and on shields medallions cups and coins the dolphin was drawn in scales ofchain armor like saladin s and a helmeted head like st george s ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed not only in most popular pictures of the whale but in many scientificpresentations of him now by all odds the most ancient extant portrait anywayspurporting to be the whale s is to be found in the famouscavern pagoda of elephants in india the brahmins maintainthat in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda all the trades and pursuits every conceivable avocation of man were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being no wonder then that in some sort our noble professionof whaling should have been there shadowed forth the hindoowhale referred to occurs in a separate department of the wall depicting the incarnation of vishnu in the form of leviathan learnedly known as the matse avatar but though this sculptureis half man and half whale so as only to give the tailof the latter yet that small section of him is all wrong it looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda than the broad palms of the true whale s majestic flukes but go to the old galleries and look now at a great christianpainter s portrait of this fish for he succeeds no betterthan the antediluvian hindoo it is guido s picture ofperseus rescuing andromeda from the sea monster or whale where did guido get the model of such a strange creature as that nor does hogarth in painting the same scene in his own perseus descending make out one whit better the hugecorpulence of that hogarthian monster undulates on the surface scarcely drawing one inch of water it has a sort of howdah onits back and its distended tusked mouth into which the billowsare rolling might be taken for the traitors gate leading fromthe thames by water into the tower then there are the prodromuswhales of the old scotch sibbald and jonah s whale as depictedin the prints of old bibles and the cuts of old primers what shall be said of these as for the book binder s whalewinding like a vine stalk round the stock of a descending anchor as stamped and gilded on the backs and titlepages of manybooks both old and new that is a very picturesque but purelyfabulous creature imitated i take it from the like figureson antique vases though universally denominated a dolphin i nevertheless call this book binder s fish an attempt at a whale because it was so intended when the device was first introduced it was introduced by an old italian publisher somewhereabout the th century during the revival of learning and in those days and even down to a comparatively late period dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the leviathan in the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient booksyou will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale where all manner of spouts jets d eau hot springs and cold saratoga and baden baden come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain in the title page of the original edition of the advancement of learning you will find some curious whales but quitting all these unprofessional attempts let us glance at thosepictures of leviathan purporting to be sober scientific delineations by those who know in old harris s collection of voyages thereare some plates of whales extracted from a dutch book of voyages a d entitled a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship jonasin the whale peter peterson of friesland master in one of thoseplates the whales like great rafts of logs are represented lyingamong ice isles with white bears running over their living backs in another plate the prodigious blunder is made of representingthe whale with perpendicular flukes then again there is an imposing quarto written by one captain colnett a post captain in the english navy entitled a voyage roundcape horn into the south seas for the purpose of extendingthe spermaceti whale fisheries in this book is an outlinepurporting to be a picture of a physeter or spermaceti whale drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of mexico august and hoisted on deck i doubt not the captain had this veraciouspicture taken for the benefit of his marines to mention but onething about it let me say that it has an eye which applied according to the accompanying scale to a full grown sperm whale would make the eye of that whale a bow window some five feet long ah my gallant captain why did ye not give us jonah lookingout of that eye nor are the most conscientious compilations of natural historyfor the benefit of the young and tender free from the sameheinousness of mistake look at that popular work goldsmith s animated nature in the abridged london editionof there are plates of an alleged whale and a narwhale i do not wish to seem inelegant but this unsightly whalelooks much like an amputated sow and as for the narwhale one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one that in this nineteenthcentury such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine uponany intelligent public of schoolboys then again in bernard germain count de lacepede a great naturalist published a scientific systemized whale book wherein are several pictures of the different species ofthe leviathan all these are not only incorrect but the pictureof the mysticetus or greenland whale that is to say the rightwhale even scoresby a long experienced man as touchingthat species declares not to have its counterpart in nature but the placing of the cap sheaf to all this blundering businesswas reserved for the scientific frederick cuvier brother to thefamous baron in he published a natural history of whales in which he gives what he calls a picture of the sperm whale before showing that picture to any nantucketer you had bestprovide for your summary retreat from nantucket in a word frederick cuvier s sperm whale is not a sperm whale but a squash of course he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage such menseldom have but whence he derived that picture who can tell perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field desmarest got one of his authentic abortions that is from achinese drawing and what sort of lively lads with the pencilthose chinese are many queer cups and saucers inform us as for the sign painters whales seen in the streets hangingover the shops of oil dealers what shall be said of them they are generally richard iii whales with dromedary humps and very savage breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts that is whaleboats full of mariners their deformitiesfloundering in seas of blood and blue paint but these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so verysurprising after all consider most of the scientific drawings havebeen taken from the stranded fish and these are about as correct as adrawing of a wrecked ship with broken back would correctly representthe noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars though elephants have stood for their full lengths the livingleviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait the living whale in his full majesty and significance is onlyto be seen at sea in unfathomable waters and afloat the vastbulk of him is out of sight like a launched line of battle ship and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortalman to hoist him bodily into the air so as to preserve all his mightyswells and undulations and not to speak of the highly presumabledifference of contour between a young suckling whale and a full grownplatonian leviathan yet even in the case of one of those youngsucking whales hoisted to a ship s deck such is then the outlandish eel like limbered varying shape of him that his precise expressionthe devil himself could not catch but it may be fancied that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale accurate hints may be derived touching his true form not at all for it is one of the more curious things about this leviathan that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape though jeremy bentham s skeleton which hangs for candelabrain the library of one of his executors correctly conveys the ideaof a burly browed utilitarian old gentleman with all jeremy sother leading personal characteristics yet nothing of thiskind could be inferred from any leviathan s articulated bones in fact as the great hunter says the mere skeleton of the whalebears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animalas the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it this peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head as in some partof this book will be incidentally shown it is also very curiouslydisplayed in the side fin the bones of which almost exactly answerto the bones of the human hand minus only the thumb this fin hasfour regular bone fingers the index middle ring and little finger but all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering as the human fingers in an artificial covering however recklesslythe whale may sometimes serve us said humorous stubb one day he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens for all these reasons then any way you may look at it you must needs conclude that the great leviathan is that onecreature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last true one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness so there is no earthly way of finding out precisely whatthe whale really looks like and the only mode in which youcan derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour is by going a whaling yourself but by so doing you runno small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him wherefore it seems to me you had best not be too fastidiousin your curiosity touching this leviathan chapter of the less erroneous pictures of whales and the true picturesof whaling scenesin connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales i am stronglytempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of themwhich are to be found in certain books both ancient and modern especially in pliny purchas hackluyt harris cuvier c but ipass that matter by i know of only four published outlines of the greatsperm whale colnett s huggins s frederick cuvier s and beale s inthe previous chapter colnett and cuvier have been referred to huggins s is far better than theirs but by great odds beale s is the best all beale s drawings of this whaleare good excepting the middle figure in the picture of threewhales in various attitudes capping his second chapter his frontispiece boats attacking sperm whales though no doubtcalculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men is admirably correct and life like in its general effect some of the sperm whale drawings in j ross browne are prettycorrect in contour but they are wretchedly engraved that is not his fault though of the right whale the best outline pictures are in scoresby but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression he has but one picture of whaling scenes and this is a sad deficiency because it is by such pictures only when at all well done that youcan derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seenby his living hunters but taken for all in all by far the finest though insome details not the most correct presentations of whalesand whaling scenes to be anywhere found are two largefrench engravings well executed and taken from paintings byone garnery respectively they represent attacks on the spermand right whale in the first engraving a noble sperm whaleis depicted in full majesty of might just risen beneath the boatfrom the profundities of the ocean and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks the prow of the boat is partially unbroken and is drawn justbalancing upon the monster s spine and standing in that prow for that one single incomputable flash of time you beholdan oarsman half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout ofthe whale and in the act of leaping as if from a precipice the action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true the half emptied line tub floats on the whitened sea the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whalein contrasting expressions of affright while in the blackstormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene serious fault might be found with the anatomical detailsof this whale but let that pass since for the life of me i could not draw so good a one in the second engraving the boat is in the act of drawing alongsidethe barnacled flank of a large running right whale that rollshis black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock slide fromthe patagonian cliffs his jets are erect full and black like soot so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney you would thinkthere must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs shell fish and other seacandies and maccaroni which the right whale sometimes carries onhis pestilent back and all the while the thick lipped leviathanis rushing through the deep leaving tons of tumultuous white curdsin his wake and causing the slight boat to rock in the swellslike a skiff caught nigh the paddle wheels of an ocean steamer thus the fore ground is all raging commotion but behind in admirable artistic contrast is the glassy level of a sea becalmed the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship and the inertmass of a dead whale a conquered fortress with the flag of capturelazily hanging from the whale pole inserted into his spout hole who garnery the painter is or was i know not but my lifefor it he was either practically conversant with his subject or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman the french are the lads for painting action go and gaze uponall the paintings in europe and where will you find such agallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas as in thattriumphal hall at versailles where the beholder fights his way pell mell through the consecutive great battles of france where every sword seems a flash of the northern lights and the successive armed kings and emperors dash by like acharge of crowned centaurs not wholly unworthy of a placein that gallery are these sea battle pieces of garnery the natural aptitude of the french for seizing the picturesquenessof things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintingsand engravings they have of their whaling scenes with not one tenth of england s experience in the fishery and not the thousandth part of that of the americans they havenevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketchesat all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt for the most part the english and american whale draughtsmenseem entirely content with presenting the mechanicaloutline of things such as the vacant profile of the whale which so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid even scoresby the justly renowned right whaleman after giving us a stiff full length of the greenland whale and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks chopping knives and grapnels and with the microscopic diligenceof a leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering worldninety six fac similes of magnified arctic snow crystals i mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager i honor himfor a veteran but in so important a matter it was certainlyan oversight not to have procured for every crystal a swornaffidavit taken before a greenland justice of the peace in addition to those fine engravings from garnery there are twoother french engravings worthy of note by some one who subscribeshimself h durand one of them though not precisely adapted to ourpresent purpose nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts it is a quiet noon scene among the isles of the pacific a frenchwhaler anchored inshore in a calm and lazily taking water on board the loosened sails of the ship and the long leaves of the palmsin the background both drooping together in the breezeless air the effect is very fine when considered with reference to itspresenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects oforiental repose the other engraving is quite a different affair the ship hove to upon the open sea and in the very heart ofthe leviathanic life with a right whale alongside the vessel in the act of cutting in hove over to the monster as if to a quay and a boat hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity is about giving chase to whales in the distance the harpoonsand lances lie levelled for use three oarsmen are just settingthe mast in its hole while from a sudden roll of the sea the littlecraft stands half erect out of the water like a rearing horse from the ship the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale isgoing up like the smoke over a village of smithies and to windward a black cloud rising up with earnest of squalls and rains seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen chapter of whales in paint in teeth in wood in sheet iron in

foremost whale any time these ten years they tell me has that man held upthat picture and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world but the time of his justification has now come his three whalesare as good whales as were ever published in wapping at any rate and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find inthe western clearings but though for ever mounted on that stump never a stump speech does the poor whaleman make but with downcast eyes stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation throughout the pacific and also in nantucket and new bedford and sag harbor you

whale hunter is as much a savage as an iroquois i myselfam a savage owning no allegiance but to the king of the cannibals and ready at any moment to rebel against him now one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage inhis domestic hours is his wonderful patience of industry an ancient hawaiian war club or spear paddle in its fullmultiplicity and elaboration of carving is as great a trophyof human perseverance as a latin lexicon for with but a bitof broken sea shell or a shark s tooth that miraculous intricacyof wooden net work has been achieved and it has cost steadyyears of

would be best but these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays on the spires of some old fashioned churches you will see sheet ironwhales placed there for weathercocks but they are so elevated and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelledwith hands off you cannot examine them closely enough to decideupon their merit in bony ribby regions of the earth where at the base of high brokencliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the leviathanpartly merged in grass which of a windy day breaks against themin a surf of green surges then again in mountainous countries where the traveller iscontinually girdled by amphitheatrical heights here and therefrom some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpsesof the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges but you must be a thorough whaleman to see these sights and not only that but if you wish to return to such a sight again you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitudeand longitude of your first stand point else so chance likeare such observations of the hills that your precise previous stand point would require a laborious re discovery like the solomon islands which still remain incognita though oncehigh ruffed mendanna trod them and old figuera chronicled them nor when expandingly

britsteering north eastward from the crozetts we fell in with vast meadowsof brit the minute yellow substance upon which the right whalelargely feeds for leagues and leagues it undulated round us so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripeand golden wheat on the second day numbers of right whales were seen who secure fromthe attack of a sperm whaler like the pequod with open jaws sluggishlyswam through the brit which adhering to the fringing fibres of thatwondrous venetian blind in their mouths was in that manner separatedfrom the water that escaped at the lips as morning mowers who side by side slowly and seethingly advancetheir scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads even so these monsters swam making a strange grassy cutting sound and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea that part of the sea known among whalemen as the brazil banks does not bear that name as the banks of newfoundland do because of there being shallows and soundings there but becauseof this remarkable meadow like appearance caused by the vastdrifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes where the right whale is often chased but it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which atall reminded one of mowers seen from the mast heads especiallywhen they paused and were stationary for a while their vast blackforms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else and as in the great hunting countries of india the strangerat a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbentelephants without knowing them to be such taking them for bare blackened elevations of the soil even so often with him who forthe first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea and even when recognized at last their immense magnitude rendersit very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowthcan possibly be instinct in all parts with the same sort of lifethat lives in a dog or a horse indeed in other respects you can hardly regard any creaturesof the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore for though some old naturalists have maintained that all creaturesof the land are of their kind in the sea and though taking a broadgeneral view of the thing this may very well be yet comingto specialties where for example does the ocean furnish any fishthat in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog the accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bearcomparative analogy to him but though to landsmen in general the native inhabitants of the seashave ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita so that columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discoverhis one superficial western one though by vast odds the mostterrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminatelybefallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone uponthe waters though but a moment s consideration will teach that however baby man may brag of his science and skill and however much in a flattering future that science and skill may augment yet for ever and for ever to the crack of doom the sea will insultand murder him and pulverize the stateliest stiffest frigatehe can make nevertheless by the continual repetition of thesevery impressions man has lost that sense of the full awfulnessof the sea which aboriginally belongs to it the first boat we read of floated on an ocean that with portuguesevengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow that same ocean rolls now that same ocean destroyed the wrecked shipsof last year yea foolish mortals noah s flood is not yet subsided two thirds of the fair world it yet covers wherein differ the sea and the land that a miracle uponone is not a miracle upon the other preternatural terrorsrested upon the hebrews when under the feet of korah and hiscompany the live ground

aliento it but it is also a fiend to its own off spring worse than the persian host who murdered his own guests sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays herown cubs so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales againstthe rocks and leaves them there side by side with the splitwrecks of ships no mercy no power but its own controls it panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lostits rider the masterless ocean overruns the globe consider the subtleness of the sea how its most dreadedcreatures glide under water unapparent for the most part and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many ofits most remorseless tribes as the dainty embellished shapeof many species of sharks consider once more the universalcannibalism of the sea all whose creatures prey upon each other carrying on eternal war since the world began consider all this and then turn to this green gentle and mostdocile earth consider them both the sea and the land and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself for as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land so in the soulof man there lies one insular tahiti full of peace and joy but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life god keep thee push not off from that isle thou canst never return chapter squidslowly wading through the meadows of brit the pequod stillheld on her way north eastward towards the island of java a gentle air impelling her keel so that in the surroundingserenity her three tall tapering masts mildly wavedto that languid breeze as three mild palms on a plain and still at wide intervals in the silvery night the lonely alluring jet would be seen but one transparent blue morning when a stillness almostpreternatural spread over the sea however unattended with anystagnant calm when the long burnished sun glade on the watersseemed a golden finger laid across them enjoining some secrecy when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectrewas seen by daggoo from the main mast head in the distance a great white mass lazily rose and rising higherand higher and disentangling itself from the azure at last gleamedbefore our prow like a snow slide new slid from the hills thus glistening for a moment as slowly it subsided and sank then once more arose and silently gleamed it seemed not a whale and yet is this moby dick thought daggoo again the phantomwent down but on re appearing once more with a stiletto likecry that startled every man from his nod the negro yelledout there there again there she breaches right ahead the white whale the white whale upon this the seamen rushed to the yard arms as in swarming timethe bees rush to the boughs bare headed in the sultry sun ahab stood on the bowsprit and with one hand pushed far behindin readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman cast his eagerglance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretchedmotionless arm of daggoo whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitaryjet had gradually worked upon ahab so that he was now preparedto connect the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sightof the particular whale he pursued however this was or whetherhis eagerness betrayed him whichever way it might have been no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass than witha quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering the four boats were soon on the water ahab s in advance and all swiftly pulling towards their prey soon it went down and while with oars suspended we were awaiting its reappearance lo in the same spot where it sank once more it slowly rose almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of moby dick we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secretseas have hitherto revealed to mankind a vast pulpy mass furlongs in length and breadth of a glancing cream color layfloating on the water innumerable long arms radiating fromits centre and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach no perceptible face or front did it have no conceivable tokenof either sensation or instinct but undulated there on the billows an unearthly formless chance like apparition of life as with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk with a wild voice exclaimed almost rather had i seen moby dickand fought him than to have seen thee thou white ghost what was it sir said flask the great live squid which they say few whale ships ever beheld and returned to their ports to tell of it but ahab said nothing turning his boat he sailed back to the vessel the rest as silently following whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connectedwith the sight of this object certain it is that a glimpse of itbeing so very unusual that circumstance has gone far to invest itwith portentousness so rarely is it beheld that though one and allof them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerningits true nature and form notwithstanding they believe it to furnishto the sperm whale his only food for though other species of whales findtheir food above water and may be seen by man in the act of feeding the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones belowthe surface and only by inference is it that any one can tellof what precisely that food consists at times when closely pursued he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length they fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarilyclings by them to the bed of the ocean and that the sperm whale unlike other species is supplied with teeth in order to attackand tear it there seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken ofbishop pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into squid the mannerin which the bishop describes it as alternately rising and sinking with some other particulars he narrates in all this the two correspond but much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulkhe assigns it by some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysteriouscreature here spoken of it is included among the class of cuttle fish to which indeed in certain external respects it would seem to belong but only as the anak of the tribe chapter the linewith reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described as well as for the better understanding of all similar sceneselsewhere presented i have here to speak of the magical sometimes horrible whale line the line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp slightly vapored with tar not impregnated with it as inthe case of ordinary ropes for while tar as ordinarily used makes the hemp more pliable to the rope maker and also rendersthe rope itself more convenient to the sailor for commonship use yet not only would the ordinary quantity too muchstiffen the whale line for the close coiling to which it mustbe subjected but as most seamen are beginning to learn tar ingeneral by no means adds to the rope s durability or strength however much it may give it compactness and gloss of late years the manilla rope has in the american fishery almostentirely superseded hemp as a material for whale lines for though notso durable as hemp it is stronger and far more soft and elastic and i will add since there is an aesthetics in all things is much more handsome and becoming to the boat than hemp hemp is a dusky dark fellow a sort of indian but manillais as a golden haired circassian to behold the whale line is only two thirds of an inch in thickness at first sight you would not think it so strong as it really is by experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weightof one hundred and twenty pounds so that the whole rope willbear a strain nearly equal to three tons in length the commonsperm whale line measures something over two hundred fathoms towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub not like the worm pipe of a still though but so as to form one round cheese shaped mass of densely bedded sheaves or layers ofconcentric spiralizations without any hollow but the heart or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese as the least tangle or kink in the coiling would in running out infallibly take somebody s arm leg or entire body off the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards througha block towards the tub so as in the act of coiling to free itfrom all possible wrinkles and twists in the english boats two tubs are used instead of one the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs there is some advantage in this because these twin tubsbeing so small they fit more readily into the boat and do not strain it so much whereas the american tub nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are butone half inch in thickness for the bottom of the whale boatis like critical ice which will bear up a considerabledistributed weight but not very much of a concentrated one when the painted canvas cover is clapped on the american line tub the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigiousgreat wedding cake to present to the whales both ends of the line are exposed the lower end terminatingin an eye splice or loop coming up from the bottom againstthe side of the tub and hanging over its edge completelydisengaged from everything this arrangement of the lower endis necessary on two accounts first in order to facilitatethe fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threatento carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon in these instances the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale as it were from the one boat to the other though the first boatalways hovers at hand to assist its consort second this arrangementis indispensable for common safety s sake for were the lowerend of the line in any way attached to the boat and werethe whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single smoking minute as he sometimes does he would not stop there for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after himinto the profundity of the sea and in that case no town crierwould ever find her again before lowering the boat for the chase the upper end of the lineis taken aft from the tub and passing round the loggerhead there is again carried forward the entire length of the boat resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man s oar so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing and also passingbetween the men as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow ofthe boat where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill prevents it from slipping out from the chocks it hangs in a slightfestoon over the bows and is then passed inside the boat again and some ten or twenty fathoms called box line being coiled uponthe box in the bows it continues its way to the gunwale stilla little further aft and is then attached to the short warp the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon but previous to that connexion the short warp goes through sundrymystifications too tedious to detail thus the whale line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction all the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions so that to the timid eye of the landsman they seem as indian jugglers with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs nor can any son of mortal woman for the first time seat himself amidthose hempen intricacies and while straining his utmost at the oar bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makesthe very marrow in his bones to

will hear over the half inchwhite cedar of the whaleboat when thus hung in hangman s nooses and like the six burghers of calais before king edward the sixmen composing the crew pull into the jaws of death with a halteraround every neck as you may say perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to accountfor those repeated whaling disasters some few of which arecasually chronicled of this man or that man being taken out ofthe boat by the line and lost for when the line is darting out to be seated then in the boat is like being seated in the midstof the manifold whizzings of a steam engine in full play when every flying beam and shaft and wheel is grazing you it is worse for you cannot sit motionless in the heart ofthese perils because the boat is rocking like a cradle and youare pitched one way and the other without the slightest warning and only by a certain self adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousnessof volition and action can you escape being made a mazeppa of and run away with where the all seeing sun himself could neverpierce you out again as the profound calm which only apparently precedes andprophesies of the storm is perhaps more awful than the storm itself for indeed the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm and contains it in itself as the seemingly harmless rifleholds the fatal powder and the ball and the explosion so the graceful repose of the line as it silently serpentinesabout the oarsmen before being brought into actual play this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any otheraspect of this dangerous affair but why say more all men liveenveloped in whale lines all are born with halters round their necks but it is only when caught in the swift sudden turn of death that mortals realize the silent subtle everpresent perils of life and if you be a philosopher though seated in the whale boat you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror than thoughseated before your evening fire with a poker and not a harpoon

noticed thatthe seamen at the main and mizzen mast heads were already drowsy so that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below fromthe slumbering helmsman the waves too nodded their indolent crests and across the wide trance of the sea east nodded to west and the sun over all suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes like vices my hands grasped the shrouds some invisible gracious agency preserved me with a shock i came back to life and lo close under our lee not forty fathoms off a giganticsperm whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hullof a frigate his broad glossy back of an ethiopian hue glistening in the sun s rays like a mirror but lazily undulatingin the trough of the sea and ever and anon tranquilly spouting hisvapory jet the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipeof a warm afternoon but that pipe poor whale was thy last as if struck by some enchanter s wand the sleepy shipand every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel simultaneously with the three notes from aloft shouted forththe accustomed cry as the great fish slowly and regularlyspouted the sparkling brine into the air clear away the boats luff cried ahab and obeying his own order he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes the sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale and erethe boats were down majestically turning he swam away to the leeward but with such a steady tranquillity and making so few ripples as he swam that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed ahab gave ordersthat not an oar should be used and no man must speak but in whispers so seated like ontario indians on the gunwales of the boats we swiftly but silently paddled along the calm not admitting ofthe noiseless sails being set presently as we thus glided in chase the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up there go flukes was the cry an announcement immediatelyfollowed by stubb s producing his match and igniting his pipe for now a respite was granted after the full interval of hissounding had elapsed the whale rose again and being now in advanceof the smoker s boat and much nearer to it than to any of the others stubb counted upon the honor of the capture it was obvious now that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers all silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use paddles were dropped and oars came loudly into play and still puffing at his pipe stubb cheered on his crewto the assault yes a mighty change had come over the fish all alive to his jeopardy he was going head out that part obliquely projecting from the madyeast which he brewed it will be seen in some other place of what a very light substancethe entire interior of the sperm whale s enormous head consists though apparently the most massive it is by far the most buoyantpart about him so that with ease he elevates it in the air and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed besides such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head and such the tapering cut water formation of the lower part that by obliquely elevating his head he thereby may be saidto transform himself from a bluff bowed sluggish galliot intoa sharppointed new york pilot boat start her start her my men don t hurry yourselves take plentyof time but start her start her like thunder claps that s all cried stubb spluttering out the smoke as he spoke start her now give em the long and strong stroke tashtego start her tash my boy start her all but keep cool keep cool cucumbers is the word easy easy only start her like grim death and grinning devils and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves boys that s all start her woo hoo wa hee screamed the gay header in reply raising someold war whoop to the skies as every oarsman in the strained boatinvoluntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading strokewhich the eager indian gave but his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild kee hee kee hee yelled daggoo straining forwards and backwardson his seat like a pacing tiger in his cage ka la koo loo howled queequeg as if smacking his lips over amouthful of grenadier s steak and thus with oars and yells the keelscut the sea meanwhile stubb retaining his place in the van still encouraged his men to the onset all the while puffing the smokefrom his mouth like desperadoes they tugged and they strained till the welcome cry was heard stand up tashtego give it to him the harpoon was hurled stern all the oarsmen backed water the samemoment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists it was the magical line an instant before stubb had swiftlycaught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead whence by reason of its increased rapid circlings a hempen blue smokenow jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe as the line passed round and round the loggerhead so also just beforereaching that point it blisteringly passed through and through bothof stubb s hands from which the hand cloths or squares of quiltedcanvas sometimes worn at these times had accidentally dropped it was like holding an enemy s sharp two edged sword by the blade and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch wet the line wet the line cried stubb to the tub oarsman him seatedby the tub who snatching off his hat dashed the sea water into it more turns were taken so that the line began holding its place the boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins stubb and tashtego here changed places stem for stern a staggeringbusiness truly in that rocking commotion partly to show the indispensableness of this act it may herebe stated that in the old dutch fishery a mop was usedto dash the running line with water in many other ships a wooden piggin or bailer is set apart for that purpose your hat however is the most convenient from the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper partof the boat and from its now being more tight than a harpstring you would have thought the craft had two keels one cleaving the water the other the air as the boat churned on through both opposingelements at once a continual cascade played at the bows a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake and at the slightest motionfrom within even but of a little finger the vibrating cracking craftcanted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea thus they rushed each man with might and main clinging to his seat to prevent beingtossed to the foam and the tall form of tashtego at the steering oarcrouching almost double in order to bring down his centre of gravity whole atlantics and pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight haul in haul in cried stubb to the bowsman and facing round towards the whale all hands began pullingthe boat up to him while yet the boat was being towed on soon ranging up by his flank stubb firmly planting his kneein the clumsy cleat darted dart after dart into the flying fish at the word of command the boat alternately sterning outof the way of the whale s horrible wallow and then ranging upfor another fling the red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooksdown a hill his tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake the slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea sent back its reflection into every face so that they all glowedto each other like red men and all the while jet after jetof white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman as at every dart hauling in upon his crooked lance by the lineattached to it stubb straightened it again and again by a fewrapid blows against the gunwale then again and again sent itinto the whale pull up pull up he now cried to the bowsman as the waningwhale relaxed in his wrath pull up close to and the boatranged along the fish s flank when reaching far over the bow stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish and keptit there carefully churning and churning as if cautiously seekingto feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out but that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish and now it is struck for starting from his trance into thatunspeakable thing called his flurry the monster horribly wallowedin his blood overwrapped himself in impenetrable mad boiling spray so that the imperilled craft instantly dropping astern had much adoblindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clearair of the day and now abating in his flurry the whale once more rolled out into view surging from side to side spasmodically dilating and contractinghis spout hole with sharp cracking agonized respirations at last gush after gush of clotted red gore as if it had beenthe purple lees of red wine shot into the frightened air and fallingback again ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea his heart had burst he s dead mr stubb said daggoo yes both pipes smoked out and withdrawing his own from his mouth stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water and for a moment stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made chapter the darta word concerning an incident in the last chapter according to the invariable usage of the fishery the whale boatpushes off from the ship with the headsman or whale killer astemporary steersman and the harpooneer or whale fastener pullingthe foremost oar the one known as the harpooneer oar now it needsa strong nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish for often in what is called a long dart the heavy implementhas to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet but however prolonged and exhausting the chase the harpooneer isexpected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost indeed he isexpected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest not onlyby incredible rowing but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one s compass while all the other muscles are strained and half started what that is none know but those who have tried it for one i cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklesslyat one and the same time in this straining bawling state then with his back to the fish all at once the exhaustedharpooneer hears the exciting cry stand up and give it to him he now has to drop and secure his oar turn round on his centrehalf way seize his harpoon from the crotch and with what littlestrength may remain he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale no wonder taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body that outof fifty fair chances for a dart not five are successful no wonderthat so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood vesselsin the boat no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent fouryears with four barrels no wonder that to many ship owners whaling is but a losing concern for it is the harpooneer that makesthe voyage and if you take the breath out of his body how canyou expect to find it there when most wanted again if the dart be successful then at the second critical instant that is when the whale starts to run the boatheader and harpooneerlikewise start to running fore and aft to the imminent jeopardyof themselves and every one else it is then they change places and the headsman the chief officer of the little craft takes hisproper station in the bows of the boat now i care not who maintains the contrary but all thisis both foolish and unnecessary the headsman should stayin the bows from first to last he should both dart the harpoonand the lance and no rowing whatever should be expectedof him except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman i know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speedin the chase but long experience in various whalemen of morethan one nation has convinced me that in the vast majorityof failures in the fishery it has not by any means been so muchthe speed of the whale as the before described exhaustionof the harpooneer that has caused them to insure the greatest efficiency in the dart the harpooneersof this world must start to their feet from out of idleness and not from out of toil chapter the crotchout of the trunk the branches grow out of them the twigs so in productive subjects grow the chapters the crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention it is a notched stick of a peculiar form some two feetin length which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboardgunwale near the bow for the purpose of furnishing a restfor the wooden extremity of the harpoons whose other naked barbed end slopingly projects from the prow thereby the weaponis instantly at hand to its hurler who snatches it up as readilyfrom its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall it is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch respectively called the first and second irons but these two harpoons each by its own cord are both connectedwith the line the object being this to dart them both if possible one instantly after the other into the same whale so that if in the coming drag one should draw out the othermay still retain a hold it is a doubling of the chances but it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous violent convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron it becomes impossible for the harpooneer however lightning likein his movements to pitch the second iron into him nevertheless as the second iron is already connected with the line and the line is running hence that weapon must at all events be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat somehow and somewhere else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands tumbled into the water it accordingly is in such cases the spare coils of box line mentioned in a preceding chapter making this feat in most instances prudently practicable but this critical act is not always unattended with the saddestand most fatal casualties furthermore you must know that when the second iron is thrownoverboard it thenceforth becomes a dangling sharp edged terror skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale entangling the lines or cutting them and making a prodigious sensation in all directions nor in general is it possible to secure it again until the whaleis fairly captured and a corpse consider now how it must be in the case of four boats all engagingone unusually strong active and knowing whale when owingto these qualities in him as well as to the thousand concurringaccidents of such an audacious enterprise eight or ten loose secondirons may be simultaneously dangling about him for of course each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the lineshould the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery all these particulars are faithfully narrated here as they will notfail to elucidate several most important however intricate passages in scenes hereafter to be painted chapter stubb s supperstubb s whale had been killed some distance from the ship it was a calm so forming a tandem of three boats we commencedthe slow business of towing the trophy to the pequod and now as we eighteen men with our thirty six arms and one hundredand eighty thumbs and fingers slowly toiled hour after hourupon that inert sluggish corpse in the sea and it seemedhardly to budge at all except at long intervals good evidencewas hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved for upon the great canal of hang ho or whatever they call it in china four or five laborers on the foot path will drawa bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along as if ladenwith piglead in bulk darkness came on but three lights up and down in the pequod smain rigging dimly guided our way till drawing nearer we sawahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment he issuedthe usual orders for securing it for the night and thenhanding his lantern to a seaman went his way into the cabin and did not come forward again until morning though in overseeing the pursuit of this whale captain ahabhad evinced his customary activity to call it so yet now that the creature was dead some vague dissatisfaction or impatience or despair seemed working in him as if the sightof that dead body reminded him that moby dick was yet to be slain and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship all that would not one jot advance his grand monomaniac object very soon you would have thought from the sound on the pequod s decks that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck and thrustrattling out of the port holes but by those clanking links the vast corpse itself not the ship is to be moored tied by the head to the stern and by the tail to the bows the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel s and seen through the darkness of the night which obscuredthe spars and rigging aloft the two ship and whale seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks whereof one reclineswhile the other remains standing a little item may as well be related here the strongest and mostreliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside is by the flukes or tail and as from its greater density that partis relatively heavier than any other excepting the side fins itsflexibility even in death causes it to sink low beneath the surface so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat in order to putthe chain round it but this difficulty is ingeniously overcome a small strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end and a weight in its middle while the other end is secured to the ship by adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the otherside of the mass so that now having girdled the whale the chainis readily made to follow suit and being slipped along the body is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail at the pointof junction with its broad flukes or lobes if moody ahab was now all quiescence at least so far as couldbe known on deck stubb his second mate flushed with conquest betrayed an unusual but still good natured excitement such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid starbuck his official superior quietly resigned to him for the timethe sole management of affairs one small helping cause of allthis liveliness in stubb was soon made strangely manifest stubb was a high liver he was somewhat intemperately fondof the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate a steak a steak ere i sleep you daggoo overboard you go and cut me one from his small here be it known that though these wild fishermen do not as a general thing and according to the great military maxim make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war at leastbefore realizing the proceeds of the voyage yet now and thenyou find some of these nantucketers who have a genuine relishfor that particular part of the sperm whale designated by stubb comprising the tapering extremity of the body about midnight that steak was cut and cooked and lighted by twolanterns of sperm oil stubb stoutly stood up to his spermacetisupper at the capstan head as if that capstan were a sideboard nor was stubb the only banqueter on whale s flesh that night mingling their mumblings with his own mastications thousands on thousandsof sharks swarming round the dead leviathan smackingly feastedon its fatness the few sleepers below in their bunks were oftenstartled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull within a few inches of the sleepers hearts peering over the side youcould just see them as before you heard them wallowing in the sullen black waters and turning over on their backs as they scooped outhuge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head this particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous how at such an apparently unassailable surface they contrive to gougeout such symmetrical mouthfuls remains a part of the universalproblem of all things the mark they thus leave on the whale may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinkingfor a screw though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea fight sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship s decks like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them and though while the valiant butchers over the deck table are thus canniballycarving each other s live meat with carving knives all gildedand tasselled the sharks also with their jewel hilted mouths are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat and though were you to turn the whole affair upside down it would still be pretty much the same thing that is to say a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties and thoughsharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave shipscrossing the atlantic systematically trotting alongside to behandy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere or a dead slaveto be decently buried and though one or two other like instancesmight be set down touching the set terms places and occasions when sharks do most socially congregate and most hilariously feast yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find themin such countless numbers and in gayer or more jovial spirits than around a dead sperm whale moored by night to a whaleship at sea if you have never seen that sight then suspend your decisionabout the propriety of devil worship and the expediency ofconciliating the devil but as yet stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquetthat was going on so nigh him no more than the sharks heededthe smacking of his own epicurean lips cook cook where s that old fleece he cried at length widening his legs still further as if to form a more securebase for his supper and at the same time darting his forkinto the dish as if stabbing with his lance cook you cook sail this way cook the old black not in any very high glee at having been previouslyrouted from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour came shambling along from his galley for like many old blacks there was something the matter with his knee pans which he didnot keep well scoured like his other pans this old fleece as they called him came shuffling and limping along assisting hisstep with his tongs which after a clumsy fashion were madeof straightened iron hoops this old ebony floundered along and in obedience to the word of command came to a dead stopon the opposite side of stubb s sideboard when with both handsfolded before him and resting on his two legged cane he bowedhis arched back still further over at the same time sidewaysinclining his head so as to bring his best ear into play cook said stubb rapidly lifting a rather reddish morselto his mouth don t you think this steak is rather overdone you ve been beating this steak too much cook it s too tender don t i always say that to be good a whale steak must be tough there are those sharks now over the side don t you see theyprefer

voice away cook and delivermy message here take this lantern snatching one from his sideboard now then go and preach to them sullenly taking the offered lantern old fleece limped acrossthe deck to the bulwarks and then with one hand drooping his lightlow over the sea so as to get a good view of his congregation with the other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs and leaningfar over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks while stubb softly crawling behind overheard all that was said fellow critters i se ordered here to say dat you must stop datdam noise dare you hear stop dat

den die now cook said stubb resuming his supper at the capstan stand just where you stood before there over against me and pay particular attention all dention said fleece again stooping over upon his tongsin the desired position well said stubb helping himself freely meanwhile i shall now go back to the subject of this steak in the first place how old are you cook what dat do wid de teak said the old black testily silence how old are you cook bout ninety dey say he gloomily muttered and have you have lived in this world hard upon one hundredyears cook and don t know yet how to cook a whale steak rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word so that that morsel seemed a continuation of the question where were you born cook hind de hatchway in ferry boat goin ober de roanoke born in a ferry boat that s queer too but i want to knowwhat country you were born in cook didn t i say de roanoke country he cried sharply no you didn t cook but i ll tell you what i m coming to cook you must

take that bit ofsteak there and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be take it i say holding the tongs towards him take it and taste it faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment the oldnegro muttered best cooked teak i eber taste joosy berry joosy cook said stubb squaring himself once more do you belongto the church passed one once in cape down said the old man sullenly and you have once in your life passed a holy church in cape town where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing hishearers as his beloved fellow creatures have you cook and yet you come here and tell me such a dreadful lie as you didjust now eh said stubb where do you expect to go to cook go to bed berry soon he mumbled half turning as he spoke avast heave to i mean when you die cook it s an awful question now what s your answer when dis old brack man dies said the negro slowly changing his whole air and demeanor he hisself won t go nowhere but some bressed angel will come and fetch him fetch him how in a coach and four as they fetched elijah and fetch him where up dere said fleece holding his tongs straight over his head and keeping it there very solemnly so then you expect to go up into our main top do you cook when you are dead but don t you know the higher you climb the colder it gets main top eh didn t say dat t all said fleece again in the sulks you said up there didn t you and now look yourself and seewhere your tongs are pointing but perhaps you expect to getinto heaven by crawling through the lubber s hole cook but no no cook you don t get there

attention all dention said the old black with both hands placed as desired vainly wriggling his grizzled head as if to get both ears in frontat one and the same time well then cook you see this whale steak of yours was so very bad that i have put it out of sight as soon as possible you see that don t you well for the future when you cook another whale steakfor my private table here the capstan i ll tell you what to doso as not to spoil it by overdoing hold the steak in one hand and show a live coal to it with the other that done dish it d ye hear and now to morrow cook when we are cutting in the fish be sureyou stand by to get the tips of his fins have them put in pickle as for the ends of the flukes have them soused cook there nowye may go but fleece had hardly got three paces off when he was recalled cook give me cutlets for supper to morrow night in the mid watch d yehear away you sail then halloa stop make a bow before you go avast heaving again whale balls for breakfast don t forget wish by gor whale eat him stead of him eat whale i m bressed if he ain t more of shark dan massa shark hisself muttered the old man limping away with which sage ejaculationhe went to his hammock chapter the whale as a dishthat mortal man should feed upon the creature that feedshis lamp and like stubb eat him by his own light as you may say this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a littleinto the history and philosophy of it it is upon record that three centuries ago the tongue of the right whalewas esteemed a great delicacy in france and commanded largeprices there also that in henry viiith s time a certain cook ofthe court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauceto be eaten with barbacued porpoises which you remember are a speciesof whale porpoises indeed are to this day considered fine eating the meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle ballsor veal balls the old monks of dunfermline were very fond of them they had a great porpoise grant from the crown the fact is that among his hunters at least the whale wouldby all hands be considered a noble dish were there not so muchof him but when you come to sit down before a meat pienearly one hundred feet long it takes away your appetite only the most unprejudiced of men like stubb nowadays partakeof cooked whales but the esquimaux are not so fastidious we all know how they live upon whales and have rare old vintagesof prime old train oil zogranda one of their most famous doctors recommends strips of blubber for infants as being exceedinglyjuicy and nourishing and this reminds me that certain englishmen who long ago were accidentally left in greenland by a whaling vessel that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldyscraps of whales which had been left ashore after tryingout the blubber among the dutch whalemen these scrapsare called fritters which indeed they greatly resemble being brown and crisp and smelling something like oldamsterdam housewives dough nuts or oly cooks when fresh they have such an eatable look that the most self denyingstranger can hardly keep his hands off but what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish is his exceeding richness he is the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be delicately good look at his hump which wouldbe as fine eating as the buffalo s which is esteemeda rare dish were it not such a solid pyramid of fat but the spermaceti itself how bland and creamy that is like the transparent half jellied white meat of a cocoanutin the third month of its growth yet far too rich to supplya substitute for butter nevertheless many whalemenhave a method of absorbing it into some other substance and then partaking of it in the long try watches of the nightit is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship biscuitinto the huge oil pots and let them fry there awhile many a good supper have i thus made in the case of a small sperm whale the brains are accounted a fine dish the casket of the skull is broken into with an axe and the two plump whitish lobes being withdrawn precisely resembling two large puddings they are then mixed with flour and cooked into a most delectable mess in flavor somewhat resembling calves head which is quite a dishamong some epicures and every one knows that some young bucks amongthe epicures by continually dining upon calves brains by and by get tohave a little brains of their own so as to be able to tell a calf s headfrom their own heads which indeed requires uncommon discrimination and that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf shead before him is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see the head looks a sort of reproachfully at him with an ettu brute expression it is not perhaps entirely because the whale is so excessivelyunctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of himwith abhorrence that appears to result in some way from the consideration before mentioned i e that a manshould eat a newly murdered thing of the sea and eat ittoo by its own light but no doubt the first man that evermurdered an ox was regarded as a murderer perhaps he was hung and if he had been put on his trial by oxen he certainly wouldhave been and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does go to the meat market of a saturday night and see the crowdsof live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal s jaw cannibals who is not a cannibal i tell you it will be moretolerable for the fejee that salted down a lean missionaryin his cellar against a coming famine it will be more tolerablefor that provident fejee i say in the day of judgment than for thee civilized and enlightened gourmand who nailestgeese to the ground and feastest on their bloated liversin thy pate de foie gras but stubb he eats the whale by its own light does he and that isadding insult to injury is it look at your knife handle there my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef what is that handle made of what but the bones of the brotherof the very ox you are eating and what do you pick your teeth with after devouring that fat goose with a feather of the same fowl and with what quill did the secretary of the society for thesuppression of cruelty to ganders formally indite his circulars it is only within the last month or two that that society passeda resolution to patronize nothing but steel pens chapter the shark massacrewhen in the southern fishery a captured sperm whale after longand weary toil is brought alongside late at night it is not as a general thing at least customary to proceed at once to the businessof cutting him in for that business is an exceedingly laborious one is not very soon completed and requires all hands to set about it therefore the common usage is to take in all sail lash the helm a lee and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight with the reservation that until that time anchor watches shall be kept that is two and two for an hour each couple the crew in rotationshall mount the deck to see that all goes well but sometimes especially upon the line in the pacific this plan will not answer at all because such incalculablehosts of sharks gather round the moored carcase that werehe left so for six hours say on a stretch little more thanthe skeleton would be visible by morning in most other partsof the ocean however where these fish do not so largely abound their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling spades a procedure notwithstanding which in some instances only seems to tickle them into still greater activity but it was not thus in the present case with the pequod s sharks though to be sure any man unaccustomed to such sights to have looked over her side that night would have almostthought the whole round sea was one huge cheese and those sharksthe maggots in it nevertheless upon stubb setting the anchor watch afterhis supper was concluded and when accordingly queequegand a forecastle seaman came on deck no small excitementwas created among the sharks for immediately suspendingthe cutting stages over the side and lowering three lanterns so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea these two mariners darting their long whaling spades keptup an incessant murdering of the sharks by striking the keensteel deep into their skulls seemingly their only vital part but in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts the marksmen could not always hit their mark and this broughtabout new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe they viciously snapped not only at each other s disembowelments but like flexible bows bent round and bit their own till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again bythe same mouth to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound nor was this all it was unsafe to meddle with the corpsesand ghosts of these creatures a sort of generic or pantheisticvitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones after what might be called the individual life had departed killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin one of these sharks almost took poor queequeg s hand off when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw the whaling spade used for cutting in is made of the very best steel is about the bigness of a man s spread hand and in general shape corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named only itssides are perfectly flat and its upper end considerably narrowerthan the lower this weapon is always kept as sharp as possible and when being used is occasionally honed just like a razor in its socket a stiff pole from twenty to thirty feet long is inserted for a handle queequeg no care what god made him shark said the savage agonizingly lifting his hand up and down wedder fejee god ornantucket god but de god wat made shark must be one dam ingin chapter cutting init was a saturday night and such a sabbath as followed ex officio professors of sabbath breaking are all whalemen the ivory pequod was turned into what seemed a shamble every sailor a butcher you would have thought we were offeringup ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods in the first place the enormous cutting tackles among other ponderousthings comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green and which no single man can possibly lift this vast bunch of grapeswas swayed up to the main top and firmly lashed to the lowermast head the strongest point anywhere above a ship s deck the end of the hawser like rope winding through these intricacies was then conducted to the windlass and the huge lower blockof the tackles was swung over the whale to this block the greatblubber hook weighing some one hundred pounds was attached and now suspended in stages over the side starbuck and stubb the mates armed with their long spades began cuttinga hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just abovethe nearest of the two side fins this done a broad semicircular line is cut round the hole the hook is inserted and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass when instantly the entire ship careens over on her side every boltin her starts like the nailheads of an old house in frosty weather she trembles quivers and nods her frighted mast heads to the sky more and more she leans over to the whale while every gasping heaveof the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows till at last a swift startling snap is heard with a greatswash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after itthe disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rinddoes an orange so is it stripped off from the body preciselyas an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it for the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continuallykeeps the whale rolling over and over in the water and asthe blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the linecalled the scarf simultaneously cut by the spades of starbuckand stubb the mates and just as fast as it is thus peeled off and indeed by that very act itself it is all the time being hoistedhigher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main top the men at the windlass then cease heaving and for a momentor two the prodigious blood dripping mass sways to and froas if let down from the sky and every one present must takegood heed to dodge it when it swings else it may box his earsand pitch him headlong overboard one of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long keen weaponcalled a boarding sword and watching his chance he dexterously slicesout a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass into this hole the end of the second alternating great tackle is thenhooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber in order to prepare forwhat follows whereupon this accomplished swordsman warning all handsto stand off once more makes a scientific dash at the mass and with afew sidelong desperate lunging slicings severs it completely in twain so that while the short lower part is still fast the long upper strip called a blanket piece swings clear and is all ready for lowering the heavers forward now resume their song and while the one tackle ispeeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale the other is slowlyslackened away and down goes the first strip through the main hatchwayright beneath into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber room intothis twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the longblanket piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents and thus the work proceeds the two tackles hoisting and loweringsimultaneously both whale and windlass heaving the heavers singing the blubber room gentlemen coiling the mates scarfing the shipstraining and all hands swearing occasionally by way of assuagingthe general friction chapter the blanketi have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject the skin of the whale i have had controversies about it withexperienced whalemen afloat and learned naturalists ashore my original opinion remains unchanged but it is only an opinion the question is what and where is the skin of the whale already you know what his blubber is that blubber is somethingof the consistence of firm close grained beef but tougher more elastic and compact and ranges from eight or ten to twelveand fifteen inches in thickness now however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature sskin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness yet in pointof fact these are no arguments against such a presumption because youcannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale s bodybut that same blubber and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal if reasonably dense what can that be but the skin true from theunmarred dead body of the whale you may scrape off with your hand aninfinitely thin transparent substance somewhat resembling the thinnestshreds of isinglass only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin that is previous to being dried when it not only contracts and thickens but becomes rather hard and brittle i have several such dried bits which i use for marks in my whale books it is transparent as isaid before and being laid upon the printed page i have sometimespleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence at any rate it is pleasant to read about whales through theirown spectacles as you may say but what i am driving at here is this that same infinitely thin isinglass substance which i admit invests the entire body of the whale is not so much to be regardedas the skin of the creature as the skin of the skin so to speak for itwere simply ridiculous to say that the proper skin of the tremendouswhale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new born child but no more of this assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale then when this skin as in the case of a very large sperm whale will yield the bulkof one hundred barrels of oil and when it is considered that in quantity or rather weight that oil in its expressed state is only three fourths and not the entire substance of the coat some ideamay hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass a merepart of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that reckoning ten barrels to the ton you have ten tons for the net weightof only three quarters of the stuff of the whale s skin in life the visible surface of the sperm whale is not the least amongthe many marvels he presents almost invariably it is all over obliquelycrossed and re crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array something like those in the finest italian line engravings but these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglasssubstance above mentioned but seem to be seen through it as if they were engraved upon the body itself nor is this all in some instances to the quick observant eye those linear marks as in a veritable engraving but afford the ground for farother delineations these are hieroglyphical that is if you callthose mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion by my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one sperm whalein particular i was much struck with a plate representingthe old indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphicpalisades on the banks of the upper mississippi like thosemystic rocks too the mystic marked whale remains undecipherable this allusion to the indian rocks reminds me of another thing besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the sperm whalepresents he not seldom displays the back and more especially his flanks effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance by reasonof numerous rude scratches altogether of an irregular random aspect i should say that those new england rocks on the seacoast which agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scrapingcontact with vast floating icebergs i should say that those rocksmust not a little resemble the sperm whale in this particular it also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probablymade by hostile contact with other whales for i have most remarkedthem in the large full grown bulls of the species a word or two more concerning this matter of the skinor blubber of the whale it has already been said that itis stript from him in long pieces called blanket pieces like most sea terms this one is very happy and significant for the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a realblanket or counterpane or still better an indian poncho sliptover his head and skirting his extremity it is by reason of thiscosy blanketing of his body that the whale is enabled to keephimself comfortable in all weathers in all seas times and tides what would become of a greenland whale say in those shuddering icy seas of the north if unsupplied with his cosy surtout true other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those hyperborean waters but these be it observed are your cold blooded lungless fish whose very bellies are refrigerators creatures that warmthemselves under the lee of an iceberg as a traveller in winterwould bask before an inn fire whereas like man the whale haslungs and warm blood freeze his blood and he dies how wonderfulis it then except after explanation that this great monster to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man how wonderful that he should be found at home immersed to his lipsfor life in those arctic waters where when seamen fall overboard they are sometimes found months afterwards perpendicularly frozeninto the hearts of fields of ice as a fly is found glued in amber but more surprising is it to know as has been proved by experiment that the blood of a polar whale is warmer than that of a borneonegro in summer it does seem to me that herein we see the rare virtue of a strongindividual vitality and the rare virtue of thick walls and the rarevirtue of interior spaciousness oh man admire and modelthyself after the whale do thou too remain warm among ice do thou too live in this world without being of it be cool at the equator keep thy blood fluid at the pole like thegreat dome of st peter s and like the great whale retain o man in all seasons a temperature of thine own but how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things of erections how few are domed like st peter s of creatures how few vast as the whale chapter the funeralhaul in the chains let the carcase go astern the vast tackles have now done their duty the peeled whitebody of the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre though changed in hue it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk it is still colossal slowly it floats more and more away the water round it torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks and the air above vexed with rapacious flights of screaming fowls whose beaks are like so many insulting poniards in the whale the vastwhite headless phantom floats further and further from the ship and every rod that it so floats what seem square roods of sharksand cubic roods of fowls augment the murderous din for hoursand hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky upon the fair faceof the pleasant sea wafted by the joyous breezes that great massof death floats on and on till lost in infinite perspectives there s a most doleful and most mocking funeral the sea vultures all in pious mourning the air sharks allpunctiliously in black or speckled in life but few of them wouldhave helped the whale i ween if peradventure he had needed it but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce oh horrible vulturism of earth from which not the mightiestwhale is free nor is this the end desecrated as the body is a vengefulghost survives and hovers over it to scare espied by sometimid man of war or blundering discovery vessel from afar when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls nevertheless stillshows the white mass floating in the sun and the white sprayheaving high against it straightway the whale s unharming corpse with trembling fingers is set down in the log shoals rocks and breakers hereabouts beware and for years afterwards perhaps ships shun the place leaping over it as silly sheepleap over a vacuum because their leader originally leapedthere when a stick was held there s your law of precedents there s your utility of traditions there s the story of yourobstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on the earth and now not even hovering in the air there s orthodoxy thus while in the life the great whale s body may have been a realterror to his foes in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panicto a world are you a believer in ghosts my friend there are other ghoststhan the cock lane one and far deeper men than doctor johnsonwho believe in them chapter the sphynxit should not have been omitted that previous to completelystripping the body of the leviathan he was beheaded now the beheading of the sperm whale is a scientific anatomical feat upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves and not without reason consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck on the contrary where his head and body seem to join there in thatvery place is the thickest part of him remember also that the surgeonmust operate from above some eight or ten feet intervening between himand his subject and that subject almost hidden in a discolored rolling and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea bear in mind too that underthese untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh and in that subterraneous manner without so much as getting one singlepeep into the ever contracting gash thus made he must skilfullysteer clear of all adjacent interdicted parts and exactly dividethe spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull do you not marvel then at stubb s boast that he demanded but tenminutes to behead a sperm whale when first severed the head is dropped astern and held thereby a cable till the body is stripped that done if it belongto a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberatelydisposed of but with a full grown leviathan this is impossible for the sperm whale s head embraces nearly one third of hisentire bulk and completely to suspend such a burden as that even by the immense tackles of a whaler this were as vain a thingas to attempt weighing a dutch barn in jewellers scales the pequod s whale being decapitated and the body stripped the headwas hoisted against the ship s side about half way out of the sea so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element and there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast head and every yard arm on that side projecting like a crane overthe waves there that blood dripping head hung to the pequod swaist like the giant holofernes s from the girdle of judith when this last task was accomplished it was noon and the seamenwent below to their dinner silence reigned over the beforetumultuous but now deserted deck an intense copper calm like a universal yellow lotus was more and more unfoldingits noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea a short space elapsed and up into this noiselessness came ahab alonefrom his cabin taking a few turns on the quarter deck he pausedto gaze over the side then slowly getting into the main chains he tookstubb s long spade still remaining there after the whale s decapitationand striking it into the lower part of the half suspended mass placed its other end crutchwise under one arm and so stood leaningover with eyes attentively fixed on this head it was a black and hooded head and hanging there in the midstof so intense a calm it seemed the sphynx s in the desert speak thou vast and venerable head muttered ahab which though ungarnished with a beard yet here and therelookest hoary with mosses speak mighty head and tell usthe secret thing that is in

ahab suddenly erectinghimself while whole thunder clouds swept aside from his brow that lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost converta better man where away three points on the starboard bow sir and bringing down herbreeze to us better and better man would now st paul would comealong that way and to my breezelessness bring his breeze o nature and o soul of man how far beyond all utterance are yourlinked analogies not the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter but has its cunning duplicate in mind chapter the jeroboam s storyhand in hand ship and breeze blew on but the breeze came fasterthan the ship and soon the pequod began to rock by and by through the glass the stranger s boats and mannedmast heads proved her a whale ship but as she was so farto windward and shooting by apparently making a passageto some other ground the pequod could not hope to reach her so the signal was set to see what response would be made here be it said that like the vessels of military marines the ships of the american whale fleet have each a private signal all which signals being collected in a book with the namesof the respective vessels attached every captain is providedwith it thereby the whale commanders are enabled to recogniseeach other upon the ocean even at considerable distance and with no small facility the pequod s signal was at last responded to by the stranger ssetting her own which proved the ship to be the jeroboamof nantucket squaring her yards she bore down ranged abeam under the pequod s lee and lowered a boat it soon drew nigh but as the side ladder was being riggedby starbuck s order to accommodate the visiting captain the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat s sternin token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary it turned out that the jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board and that mayhew her captain was fearful of infectingthe pequod s company for though himself and the boat s crewremained untainted and though his ship was half a rifle shot off and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the pequod but this did by no means prevent all communications preserving an interval of some few yards between itself andthe ship the jeroboam s boat by the occasional use of its oarscontrived to keep parallel to the pequod as she heavily forgedthrough the sea for by this time it blew very fresh with hermain topsail aback though indeed at times by the sudden onsetof a large rolling wave the boat would be pushed some way ahead but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again subject to this and other the like interruptions now and then a conversation was sustained between the two parties but at intervals not without still another interruption of avery different sort pulling an oar in the jeroboam s boat was a man of a singular appearance even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make upall totalities he was a small short youngish man sprinkled allover his face with freckles and wearing redundant yellow hair a long skirted cabalistically cut coat of a faded walnut tinge envelopedhim the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists a deep settled fanatic delirium was in his eyes so soon as this figure had been first descried stubb had exclaimed that s he that s he the long togged scaramouch the town ho s companytold us of stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the jeroboam and a certain man among her crew some time previous when the pequod spokethe town ho according to this account and what was subsequently learned it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderfulascendency over almost everybody in the jeroboam his story was this he had been originally nurtured among the crazy society ofneskyeuna shakers where he had been a great prophet in their cracked secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the wayof a trapdoor announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial which he carried in his vest pocket but which instead ofcontaining gunpowder was supposed to be charged with laudanum a strange apostolic whim having seized him he had left neskyeunafor nantucket where with that cunning peculiar to craziness he assumed a steady common sense exterior and offered himselfas a green hand candidate for the jeroboam s whaling voyage they engaged him but straightway upon the ship s gettingout of sight of land his insanity broke out in a freshet he announced himself as the archangel gabriel and commandedthe captain to jump overboard he published his manifesto whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of the islesof the sea and vicar general of all oceanica the unflinchingearnestness with which he declared these things the dark daring play of his sleepless excited imagination and allthe preternatural terrors of real delirium united to investthis gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew with an atmosphere of sacredness moreover they were afraid of him as such a man however was not of much practical use in the ship especially as he refused to work except when he pleased the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him but apprised that that individual s intention was to land himin the first convenient port the archangel forthwith openedall his seals and vials devoting the ship and all hands tounconditional perdition in case this intention was carried out so strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew that at last in a body they went to the captain and told himif gabriel was sent from the ship not a man of them would remain he was therefore forced to relinquish his plan nor would theypermit gabriel to be any way maltreated say or do what he would so that it came to pass that gabriel had the complete freedomof the ship the consequence of all this was that the archangelcared little or nothing for the captain and mates and sincethe epidemic had broken out he carried a higher hand than ever declaring that the plague as he called it was at his sole command nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure the sailors mostly poor devils cringed and some of themfawned before him in obedience to his instructions sometimes rendering him personal homage as to a god such things may seem incredible but however wondrous they are true nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respectto the measureless self deception of the fanatic himself as hismeasureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others but it is time to return to the pequod i fear not thy epidemic man said ahab from the bulwarks to captain mayhew who stood in the boat s stern come on board but now gabriel started to his feet think think of the fevers yellow and bilious beware of the horrible plague gabriel gabriel cried captain mayhew thou must either but that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead and its seethings drowned all speech hast thou seen the white whale demanded ahab when theboat drifted back think think of thy whale boat stoven and sunk beware of the horrible tail i tell thee again gabriel that but again the boat tore aheadas if dragged by fiends nothing was said for some moments while a succession of riotous waves rolled by which by one of thoseoccasional caprices of the seas were tumbling not heaving it meantime the hoisted sperm whale s head jogged about very violently and gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensivenessthan his archangel nature seemed to warrant when this interlude was over captain mayhew began a darkstory concerning moby dick not however without frequentinterruptions from gabriel whenever his name was mentioned and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him it seemed that the jeroboam had not long left home when uponspeaking a whale ship her people were reliably apprisedof the existence of moby dick and the havoc he had made greedily sucking in this intelligence gabriel solemnly warnedthe captain against attacking the white whale in case the monstershould be seen in his gibbering insanity pronouncing the white whaleto be no less a being than the shaker god incarnated the shakersreceiving the bible but when some year or two afterwards moby dick was fairly sighted from the mast heads macey the chief mate burned with ardor to encounter him and the captainhimself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity despite all the archangel s denunciations and forewarnings macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat with them he pushed off and after much weary pulling and many perilous unsuccessful onsets he at last succeededin getting one iron fast meantime gabriel ascending to themain royal mast head was tossing one arm in frantic gestures and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegiousassailants of his divinity now while macey the mate was standing up in his boat s bow and with all the reckless energyof his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance lo a broadwhite shadow rose from the sea by its quick fanning motion temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen next instant the luckless mate so full of furious life was smitten bodily into the air and making a long arc in his descent fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards not a chip of the boat was harmed nor a hair of any oarsman s head but the mate for ever sank it is well to parenthesize here that of the fatal accidents in thesperm whale fishery this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any sometimes nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated oftener the boat s bow is knocked off or the thigh board on whichthe headsman stands is torn from its place and accompanies the body but strangest of all is the circumstance that in more instances than one when the body has been recovered not a single mark of violence isdiscernible the man being stark dead the whole calamity with the falling form of macey was plainly descriedfrom the ship raising a piercing shriek the vial the vial gabriel called off the terror stricken crew from the furtherhunting of the whale this terrible event clothed the archangelwith added influence because his credulous disciples believedthat he had specifically fore announced it instead of only makinga general prophecy which any one might have done and so havechanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed he became a nameless terror to the ship mayhew having concluded his narration ahab put such questions to him that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whetherhe intended to hunt the white whale if opportunity should offer to which ahab answered aye straightway then gabriel once morestarted to his feet glaring upon the old man and vehemently exclaimed with downward pointed finger think think of the blasphemer dead and down there beware of the blasphemer s end ahab stolidly turned aside then said to mayhew captain i have justbethought me of my letter bag there is a letter for one of thy officers if i mistake not starbuck look over the bag every whale ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans thus most letters never reach their mark and many are only receivedafter attaining an age of two or three years or more soon starbuck returned with a letter in his hand it wassorely tumbled damp and covered with a dull spotted green mould in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin of such a letter death himself might well have been the post boy can st not read it cried ahab give it me man aye aye aye it sbut a dim scrawl what s this as he was studying it out starbuck tooka long cutting spade pole and with his knife slightly split the end to insert the letter there and in that way hand it to the boat without its coming any closer to the ship meantime ahab holding the letter muttered mr har yes mr harry a woman s pinny hand the man s wife i ll wager aye mr harry macey ship jeroboam why it s macey and he s dead poor fellow poor fellow and from his wife sighed mayhew but let me have it nay keep it thyself cried gabriel to ahab thou art soongoing that way curses throttle thee yelled ahab captain mayhew stand by now to receive it and taking the fatal missivefrom starbuck s hands he caught it in the slit of the pole and reached it over towards the boat but as he did so the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing the boat drifteda little towards the ship s stern so that as if by magic the letter suddenly ranged along with gabriel s eager hand he clutched it in an instant seized the boat knife and impalingthe letter on it sent it thus loaded back into the ship it fell at ahab s feet then gabriel shrieked out to his comradesto give way with their oars and in that manner the mutinousboat rapidly shot away from the pequod as after this interlude the seamen resumed their work uponthe jacket of the whale many strange things were hintedin reference to this wild affair chapter the monkey ropein the tumultuous business of cutting in and attending to a whale there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew now hands are wanted here and then again hands are wanted there there is no staying in any one place for at one and the sametime everything has to be done everywhere it is muchthe same with him who endeavors the description of the scene we must now retrace our way a little it was mentioned that uponfirst breaking ground in the whale s back the blubber hook wasinserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook getfixed in that hole it was inserted there by my particularfriend queequeg whose duty it was as harpooneer to descendupon the monster s back for the special purpose referred to but in very many cases circumstances require that the harpooneershall remain on the whale till the whole tensing or strippingoperation is concluded the whale be it observed lies almostentirely submerged excepting the immediate parts operated upon so down there some ten feet below the level of the deck the poorharpooneer flounders about half on the whale and half in the water as the vast mass revolves like a tread mill beneath him on the occasion in question queequeg figured in the highland costume a shirt and socks in which to my eyes at least he appeared touncommon advantage and no one had a better chance to observe him as will presently be seen being the savage s bowsman that is the person who pulledthe bow oar in his boat the second one from forward it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while takingthat hard scrabble scramble upon the dead whale s back you have seen italian organ boys holding a dancing ape by a long cord just so from the ship s steep side did i hold queequeg downthere in the sea by what is technically called in the fisherya monkey rope attached to a strong strip of canvas beltedround his waist it was a humorously perilous business for both of us for before weproceed further it must be said that the monkey rope was fast atboth ends fast to queequeg s broad canvas belt and fast to my narrowleather one so that for better or for worse we two for the time were wedded and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more then bothusage and honor demanded that instead of cutting the cord it should dragme down in his wake so then an elongated siamese ligature united us queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother nor could i any way getrid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed so strongly and metaphysically did i conceive of my situation then that while earnestly watching his motions i seemed distinctlyto perceive that my own individuality was now merged in ajoint stock company of two that my free will had receiveda mortal wound and that another s mistake or misfortunemight plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death therefore i saw that here was a sort of interregnum in providence for its even handed equity never could have so gross an injustice and yet still further pondering while i jerked him now andthen from between the whale and ship which would threatento jam him still further pondering i say i saw that thissituation of mine was the precise situation of every mortalthat breathes only in most cases he one way or other has this siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals if your banker breaks you snap if your apothecary by mistakesends you poison in your pills you die true you maysay that by exceeding caution you may possibly escapethese and the multitudinous other evil chances of life but handle queequeg s monkey rope heedfully as i would sometimes he jerked it so that i came very near sliding overboard nor could i possibly forget that do what i would i only hadthe management of one end of it the monkey rope is found in all whalers but it was only inthe pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together this improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no lessa man than stubb in order to afford to the imperilled harpooneerthe strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilanceof his monkey rope holder i have hinted that i would often jerk poor queequeg from betweenthe whale and the ship where he would occasionally fall from the incessant rolling and swaying of both but this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pentblood which began to flow from the carcass the rabid creaturesswarmed round it like bees in a beehive and right in among those sharks was queequeg who often pushedthem aside with his floundering feet a thing altogetherincredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldomtouch a man nevertheless it may well be believed that since they havesuch a ravenous finger in the pie it is deemed but wiseto look sharp to them accordingly besides the monkey rope with which i now and then jerked the poor fellow from tooclose a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarlyferocious shark he was provided with still another protection suspended over the side in one of the stages tashtego and daggoocontinually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale spades wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach this procedure of theirs to be sure was very disinterestedand benevolent of them they meant queequeg s best happiness i admit but in their hasty zeal to befriend him and fromthe circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times halfhidden by the blood muddled water those indiscreet spadesof theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall but poor queequeg i suppose straining and gasping therewith that great iron hook poor queequeg i suppose only prayedto his yojo and gave up his life into the hands of his gods well well my dear comrade and twin brother thought i as idrew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea what matters it after all are you not the preciousimage of each and all of us men in this whaling world that unsounded ocean you gasp in is life those sharks your foes those spades your friends and what between sharks and spadesyou are in a sad pickle and peril poor lad but courage there is good cheer in store for you queequeg for now as with blue lips and blood shot eyes the exhausted savage at lastclimbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarilytrembling over the side the steward advances and with a benevolent consolatory glance hands him what some hot cognac no hands him ye gods hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water ginger do i smell ginger suspiciously asked stubb coming near yes this must be ginger peering into the as yet untasted cup then standing as if incredulous for a while he calmly walked towardsthe astonished steward slowly saying ginger ginger and will you havethe goodness to tell me mr dough boy where lies the virtue of ginger ginger is ginger the sort of fuel you use dough boy to kindle a firein this shivering cannibal ginger what the devil is ginger sea coal firewood lucifer matches tinder gunpowder what the devilis ginger i say that you offer this cup to our poor queequeg here there is some sneaking temperance society movement about this business he suddenly added now approaching starbuck who had just comefrom forward will you look at that kannakin sir smell of it if you please then watching the mate s countenance he added the steward mr starbuck had the face to offer that calomeland jalap to queequeg there this instant off the whale is the steward an apothecary sir and may i ask whether thisis the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life intoa half drowned man i trust not said starbuck it is poor stuff enough aye aye steward cried stubb we ll teach you to drug it harpooneer none of your apothecary s medicine here you want to poison us do ye you have got out insurances on our lives and want to give way withtheir oars and pocket the proceeds do ye it was not me cried dough boy it was aunt charity that broughtthe ginger on board and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits but only this ginger jub so she called it ginger jub you gingerly rascal take that and runalong with ye to the lockers and get something better i hope i do no wrong mr starbuck it is the captain s orders grog for the harpooneer on a whale enough replied starbuck only don t hit him again but oh i never hurt when i hit except when i hit a whaleor something of that sort and this fellow s a weazel what were you about saying sir only this go down with him and get what thou wantest thyself when stubb reappeared he came with a dark flask in one hand and asort of tea caddy in the other the first contained strong spirits and was handed to queequeg the second was aunt charity s gift and that was freely given to the waves chapter stubb and flask kill a right whale and then have a talk over himit must be borne in mind that all this time we have a sperm whale sprodigious head hanging to the pequod s side but we must let itcontinue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it for the present other matters press and the best we can do now forthe head is to pray heaven the tackles may hold now during the past night and forenoon the pequod had graduallydrifted into a sea which by its occasional patches of yellow brit gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of right whales a speciesof the leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular timelurking anywhere near and though all hands commonly disdainedthe capture of those inferior creatures and though the pequodwas not commissioned to cruise for them at all and though she hadpassed numbers of them near the crozetts without lowering a boat yet now that a sperm whale had been brought alongside and beheaded to the surprise of all the announcement was made that a right whaleshould be captured that day if opportunity offered nor was this long wanting tall spouts were seen to leeward and two boats stubb s and flask s were detached in pursuit pulling further and further away they at last became almostinvisible to the men at the masthead but suddenly in the distance they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water and soon afternews came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast an interval passed and the boats were in plain sight in the actof being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale so close did the monster come to the hull that at first it seemedas if he meant it malice but suddenly going down in a maelstrom within three rods of the planks he wholly disappeared from view as if diving under the keel cut cut was the cry fromthe ship to the boats which for one instant seemed on the pointof being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel s side but having plenty of line yet in the tubs and the whale not soundingvery rapidly they paid out abundance of rope and at the sametime pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship for a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction and still plied their oars in another the contending strainthreatened to take them under but it was only a few feet advancethey sought to gain and they stuck to it till they did gain it when instantly a swift tremor was felt running like lightningalong the keel as the strained line scraping beneath the ship suddenly rose to view under her bows snapping and quivering and so flinging off its drippings that the drops fell likebits of broken glass on the water while the whale beyondalso rose to sight and once more the boats were free to fly but the fagged whale abated his speed and blindly altering his course went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him so that they performed a complete circuit meantime they hauled more and more upon their lines till closeflanking him on both sides stubb answered flask with lance for lance and thus round and round the pequod the battle went while the multitudesof sharks that had before swum round the sperm whale s body rushed tothe fresh blood that was spilled thirstily drinking at every new gash as the eager israelites did at the new bursting fountains that pouredfrom the smitten rock at last his spout grew thick and with a frightful roll and vomit he turned upon his back a corpse while the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing some conversation ensued between them i wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard said stubb not without some disgust at the thought of havingto do with so ignoble a leviathan wants with it said flask coiling some spare line in the boat s bow did you never hear that the ship which but once has a sperm whale shead hoisted on her starboard side and at the same time a right whale son the larboard did you never hear stubb that that ship cannever afterwards capsize why not i don t know but i heard that gamboge ghost of a fedallahsaying so and he seems to know all about ships charms but isometimes think he ll charm the ship to no good at last i don t half like that chap stubb did you ever notice how thattusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake s head stubb sink him i never look at him at all but if ever i get a chanceof a dark night and he standing hard by the bulwarks and no one by look down there flask pointing into the sea with a peculiar motionof both hands aye will i flask i take that fedallah to bethe devil in disguise do you believe that cock and bull story abouthis having been stowed away on board ship he s the devil i say the reason why you don t see his tail is because he tucks it upout of sight he carries it coiled away in his pocket i guess blast him now that i think of it he s always wanting oakum to stuffinto the toes of his boots he sleeps in his boots don t he he hasn t got any hammock but i ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging no doubt and it s because of his cursed tail he coils it down do ye see in the eye of the rigging what s the old man have so much to do with him for striking up a swap or a bargain i suppose bargain about what why do ye see the old man is hard bent after that white whale and the devil there is trying to come round him and get him to swapaway his silver watch or his soul or something of that sort and then he ll surrender moby dick pooh stubb you are skylarking how can fedallah do that i don t know flask but the devil is a curious chap and awicked one i tell ye why they say as how he went a saunteringinto the old flag ship once switching his tail about devilish easyand gentlemanlike and inquiring if the old governor was at home well he was at home and asked the devil what he wanted the devil switching his hoofs up and says i want john what for says the old governor what business is that of yours says the devil getting mad i want to use him take him says the governor and by the lord flask if the devil didn t give john the asiatic cholerabefore he got through with him i ll eat this whale in one mouthful but look sharp ain t you all ready there well then pull ahead and let s get the whale alongside i think i remember some such story as you were telling said flask when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burdentowards the ship but i can t remember where three spaniards adventures of those three bloody minded soldadoes did ye read it there flask i guess ye did no never saw such a book heard of it though but now tell me stubb do you suppose that that devil you was speakingof just now was the same you say is now on board the pequod am i the same man that helped kill this whale doesn t the devillive for ever who ever heard that the devil was dead did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil and if the devil has a latch key to get into the admiral scabin don t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole tell me that mr flask how old do you suppose fedallah is stubb do you see that mainmast there pointing to the ship well that sthe figure one now take all the hoops in the pequod s hold and string em along in a row with that mast for oughts do you see well that wouldn t begin to be fedallah s age nor all the coopers in creation couldn t show hoops enoughto make oughts enough but see here stubb i thought you a little boasted just now that you meant to give fedallah a sea toss if you got a good chance now if he s so old as all those hoops of yours come to and if he isgoing to live for ever what good will it do to pitch him overboard tell me that give him a good ducking anyhow but he d crawl back duck him again and keep ducking him suppose he should take it into his head to duck you though yes and drown you what then i should like to see him try it i d give him such a pair of black eyesthat he wouldn t dare to show his face in the admiral s cabin againfor a long while let alone down in the orlop there where he lives and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much damn the devil flask do you suppose i m afraid of the devil who s afraid of him except the old governor who daresn t catchhim and put him in double darbies as he deserves but lets himgo about kidnapping people aye and signed a bond with him that all the people the devil kidnapped he d roast for him there s a governor do you suppose fedallah wants to kidnap captain ahab do i suppose it you ll know it before long flask but i amgoing now to keep a sharp look out on him and if i see anythingvery suspicious going on i ll just take him by the nape of his neck and say look here beelzebub you don t do it and if he makesany fuss by the lord i ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail take it to the capstan and give him such a wrenching and heaving that his tail will come short off at the stump do you see and then i rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion he ll sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tailbetween his legs and what will you do with the tail stubb do with it sell it for an ox whip when we get home what else now do you mean what you say and have been saying all along stubb mean or not mean here we are at the ship the boats were here hailed to tow the whale on the larboard side where fluke chains and other necessaries were already preparedfor securing him didn t i tell you so said flask yes you ll soon see thisright whale s head hoisted up opposite that parmacety s in good time flask s saying proved true as before the pequod steeplyleaned over towards the sperm whale s head now by the counterpoiseof both heads she regained her even keel though sorely strained you may well believe so when on one side you hoist in locke s head you go over that way but now on the other side hoist in kant s and youcome back again but in very poor plight thus some minds for ever keeptrimming boat oh ye foolish throw all these thunder heads overboard and then you will float light and right in disposing of the body of a right whale when brought alongsidethe ship the same preliminary proceedings commonly take placeas in the case of a sperm whale only in the latter instance the head is cut off whole but in the former the lipsand tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck with all the well known black bone attached to what is calledthe crown piece but nothing like this in the present case had been done the carcases of both whales had dropped astern and the head laden ship not a little resembled a mule carryinga pair of overburdening panniers meantime fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale s head and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the linesin his own hand and ahab chanced so to stand that the parseeoccupied his shadow while if the parsee s shadow was there atall it seemed only to blend with and lengthen ahab s as the crewtoiled on laplandish speculations were bandied among them concerning all these passing things chapter the sperm whale s head contrasted viewhere now are two great whales laying their heads together let us join them and lay together our own of the grand order of folio leviathans the sperm whale andthe right whale are by far the most noteworthy they are the onlywhales regularly hunted by man to the nantucketer they presentthe two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale as the external difference between them is mainly observablein their heads and as a head of each is this moment hanging fromthe pequod s side and as we may freely go from one to the other by merely stepping across the deck where i should like to know will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here in the first place you are struck by the general contrast betweenthese heads both are massive enough in all conscience but there is acertain mathematical symmetry in the sperm whale s which the right whale ssadly lacks there is more character in the sperm whale s head as you behold it you involuntarily yield the immense superiorityto him in point of pervading dignity in the present instance too this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt color of his headat the summit giving token of advanced age and large experience in short he is what the fishermen technically call a grey headed whale let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads namely the two most important organs the eye and the ear far back on the side of the head and low down near the angleof either whale s jaw if you narrowly search you will at last seea lashless eye which you would fancy to be a young colt s eye so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head now from this peculiar sideway position of the whale s eyes it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead no more than he can one exactly astern in a word the positionof the whale s eyes corresponds to that of a man s ears and you may fancy for yourself how it would fare with you did you sideways survey objects through your ears you would find that you could only command some thirty degreesof vision in advance of the straight side line of sight and about thirty more behind it if your bitterest foe werewalking straight towards you with dagger uplifted in broad day you would not be able to see him any more than if he werestealing upon you from behind in a word you would havetwo backs so to speak but at the same time also two fronts side fronts for what is it that makes the front of a man what indeed but his eyes moreover while in most other animals that i can now think of the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend theirvisual power so as to produce one picture and not twoto the brain the peculiar position of the whale s eyes effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head which towers between them like a great mountain separatingtwo lakes in valleys this of course must wholly separatethe impressions which each independent organ imparts the whale therefore must see one distinct picture on this side and another distinct picture on that side while allbetween must be profound darkness and nothingness to him man may in effect be said to look out on the worldfrom a sentry box with two joined sashes for his window but with the whale these two sashes are separately inserted making two distinct windows but sadly impairing the view this peculiarity of the whale s eyes is a thing always to beborne in mind in the fishery and to be remembered by the readerin some subsequent scenes a curious and most puzzling question might be started concerningthis visual matter as touching the leviathan but i must be contentwith a hint so long as a man s eyes are open in the light the act of seeing is involuntary that is he cannot thenhelp mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him nevertheless any one s experience will teach him that thoughhe can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance it is quite impossible for him attentively and completely to examine any two things however large or however small at one and the same instant of time never mind if they lieside by side and touch each other but if you now cometo separate these two objects and surround each by a circleof profound darkness then in order to see one of them in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it the otherwill be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness how is it then with the whale true both his eyes in themselves must simultaneously act but is his brain so much more comprehensive combining and subtle than man s that he can at the same momentof time attentively examine two distinct prospects one on oneside of him and the other in an exactly opposite direction if he can then is it as marvellous a thing in him as if a manwere able simultaneously to go through the demonstrationsof two distinct problems in euclid nor strictly investigated is there any incongruity in this comparison it may be but an idle whim but it has always seemed to me that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayedby some whales when beset by three or four boats the timidityand liability to queer frights so common to such whales i think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helplessperplexity of volition in which their divided and diametricallyopposite powers of vision must involve them but the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye if you are an entire stranger to their race you might huntover these two heads for hours and never discover that organ the ear has no external leaf whatever and into the hole itselfyou can hardly insert a quill so wondrously minute is it it is lodged a little behind the eye with respect to their ears this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whaleand the right while the ears of the former has an external opening that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane so as to be quite imperceptible from without is it not curious that so vast a being as the whale shouldsee the world through so small an eye and hear the thunderthrough an ear which is smaller than a hare s but if hiseyes were broad as the lens of herschel s great telescope and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals would that make him any longer of sight or sharper of hearing not at all why then do you try to enlarge your mind subtilize it let us now with whatever levers and steam engines we have at hand cant over the sperm whale s head so that it may lie bottom up then ascending by a ladder to the summit have a peep down the mouth and wereit not that the body is now completely separated from it with a lanternwe might descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of his stomach but let us hold on here by this tooth and look about us where we are what a really beautiful and chaste looking mouth from floorto ceiling lined or rather papered with a glistening white membrane glossy as bridal satins but come out now and look at this portentous lower jaw which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff box with the hinge at one end instead of one side if you pry it up so as to get it overhead and expose its rows of teeth it seemsa terrific portcullis and such alas it proves to many a poor wightin the fishery upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force but far more terrible is it to behold when fathoms down inthe sea you see some sulky whale floating there suspended with his prodigious jaw some fifteen feet long hanging straightdown at right angles with his body for all the world like aship s jibboom this whale is not dead he is only dispirited out of sorts perhaps hypochondriac and so supine that the hingesof his jaw have relaxed leaving him there in that ungainly sortof plight a reproach to all his tribe who must no doubt imprecate lock jaws upon him in most cases this lower jaw being easily unhinged by a practised artist is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extractingthe ivory teeth and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebonewith which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articlesincluding canes umbrella stocks and handles to riding whips with a long weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board as if it were an anchor and when the proper time comes some few days after the other work queequeg daggoo and tashtego being all accomplished dentists are set to drawing teeth with a keen cutting spade queequeg lances the gums then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts and a tackle beingrigged from aloft they drag out these teeth as michigan oxendrag stumps of old oaks out of wild woodlands there aregenerally forty two teeth in all in old whales much worn down but undecayed nor filled after our artificial fashion the jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs and piled away like joistsfor building houses chapter the right whale s head contrasted viewcrossing the deck let us now have a good long look at the theright whale s head as in general shape the noble sperm whale s head may be comparedto a roman war chariot especially in front where it is sobroadly rounded so at a broad view the right whale s head bearsa rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot toed shoe two hundred years ago an old dutch voyager likened its shapeto that of a shoemaker s last and in this same last or shoe that old woman of the nursery tale with the swarming brood might very comfortably be lodged she and all her progeny but as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assumedifferent aspects according to your point of view if you stand on its summit and look at these two f shapedspout holes you would take the whole head for an enormous bass viol and these spiracles the apertures in its soundingboard then again if you fix your eye upon this strange crested comblike incrustation on the top of the mass this green barnacled thing which the greenlanders call the crown and the southern fishers the bonnet of the right whale fixing your eyes solely on this you would take the head forthe trunk of some huge oak with a bird s nest in its crotch at any rate when you watch those live crabs that nestle here onthis bonnet such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you unless indeed your fancy has been fixed by the technical term crown also bestowed upon it in which case you will takegreat interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actuallya diademed king of the sea whose green crown has been puttogether for him in this marvellous manner but if this whalebe a king he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem look at that hanging lower lip what a huge sulk and pout isthere a sulk and pout by carpenter s measurement about twentyfeet long and five feet deep a sulk and pout that will yieldyou some gallons of oil and more a great pity now that this unfortunate whale should be hare lipped the fissure is about a foot across probably the mother duringan important interval was sailing down the peruvian coast when earthquakes caused the beach to gape over this lip as over a slippery threshold we now slide into the mouth upon my word were i at mackinaw i should take this to be the insideof an indian wigwam good lord is this the road that jonah went the roof is about twelve feet high and runs to a pretty sharp angle as if there were a regular ridge pole there while these ribbed arched hairy sides present us with those wondrous half vertical scimitar shaped slats of whalebone say three hundred on a side which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone form those venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned the edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres through which the right whale strains the water and in whoseintricacies he retains the small fish when openmouthed he goesthrough the seas of brit in feeding time in the central blindsof bone as they stand in their natural order there are certaincurious marks curves hollows and ridges whereby some whalemencalculate the creature s age as the age of an oak by its circular rings though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable yet it has the savor of analogical probability at any rate if we yield to it we must grant a far greater age to the right whalethan at first glance will seem reasonable in old times there seem to have prevailed the most curious fanciesconcerning these blinds one voyager in purchas calls them the wondrous whiskers inside of the whale s mouth another hogs bristles a third old gentleman in hackluyt uses the following elegant language there are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of hisupper chop which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth this reminds us that the right whale really has a sort of whisker or rather a moustache consisting of a few scattered whitehairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish expressionto his otherwise solemn countenance as every one knows these same hogs bristles fins whiskers blinds or whatever you please furnish tothe ladies their busks and other stiffening contrivances but in this particular the demand has long been on the decline it was in queen anne s time that the bone was in its glory the farthingale being then all the fashion and as those ancientdames moved about gaily though in the jaws of the whale as youmay say even so in a shower with the like thoughtlessness do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone but now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment and standing in the right whale s mouth look around you afresh seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about would you not think you were inside of the great haarlem organ and gazing upon its thousand pipes for a carpet to the organwe have a rug of the softest turkey the tongue which is glued as it were to the floor of the mouth it is very fatand tender and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck this particular tongue now before us at a passing glance ishould say it was a six barreler that is it will yield youabout that amount of oil ere this you must have plainly seen the truth of what i started with that the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirelydifferent heads to sum up then in the right whale s thereis no great well of sperm no ivory teeth at all no long slender mandible of a lower jaw like the sperm whale s norin the sperm whale are there any of those blinds of bone no huge lower lip and scarcely anything of a tongue again the right whale has two external spout holes the sperm whale only one look your last now on these venerable hooded heads while theyyet lie together for one will soon sink unrecorded in the sea the other will not be very long in following can you catch the expression of the sperm whale s there it is the same he died with only some of the longer wrinklesin the forehead seem now faded away i think his broad browto be full of a prairie like placidity born of a speculativeindifference as to death but mark the other head s expression see that amazing lower lip pressed by accident against the vessel s side so as firmly to embrace the jaw does not this whole head seemto speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death this right whale i take to have been a stoic the sperm whale a platonian who might have taken up spinoza in his latter years chapter the battering ramere quitting for the nonce the sperm whale s head i would have you as a sensible physiologist simply particularly remark its front aspect in all its compacted collectedness i would have you investigate itnow with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated intelligent estimate of whatever battering ram power may be lodged there here is a vital point for you must either satisfactorily settlethis matter with yourself or for ever remain an infidel as to oneof the most appalling but not the less true events perhaps anywhereto be found in all recorded history you observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whale the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical planeto the water you observe that the lower part of that frontslopes considerably backwards so as to furnish more of a retreatfor the long socket which receives the boom like lower jaw you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head much in the same way indeed as though your own mouth wereentirely under your chin moreover you observe that the whalehas no external nose and that what nose he has his spout hole is on the top of his head you observe that his eyes and earsare at the sides of his head nearly one third of his entirelength from the front wherefore you must now have perceivedthat the front of the sperm whale s head is a dead blind wall without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever furthermore you are now to consider that only in the extreme lower backward sloping part of the front of the head is therethe slightest vestige of bone and not till you get near twenty feetfrom the forehead do you come to the full cranial development so that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad finally though as will soon be revealed its contents partlycomprise the most delicate oil yet you are now to be apprisedof the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests allthat apparent effeminacy in some previous place i have describedto you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale as the rindwraps an orange just so with the head but with this difference about the head this envelope though not so thick is of aboneless toughness inestimable by any man who has not handled it the severest pointed harpoon the sharpest lance dartedby the strongest human arm impotently rebounds from it it is as though the forehead of the sperm whale were pavedwith horses hoofs i do not think that any sensation lurks in it bethink yourself also of another thing when two large loaded indian men chance to crowd and crush towards each otherin the docks what do the sailors do they do not suspendbetween them at the point of coming contact any merelyhard substance like iron or wood no they hold there a large round wad of tow and cork enveloped in the thickest and toughestof ox hide that bravely and uninjured takes the jam which wouldhave snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow bars byitself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact i drive at but supplementary to this it has hypothetically occurred to me that as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladderin them capable at will of distension or contraction and as the sperm whale as far as i know has no such provisionin him considering too the otherwise inexplicable mannerin which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope considering the unique interior of his head it hashypothetically occurred to me i say that those mysticallung celled honeycombs there may possibly have some hithertounknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer air so asto be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction if this be so fancy the irresistibleness of that might to whichthe most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes now mark unerringly impelling this dead impregnable uninjurable wall and this most buoyant thing within there swims behind it all a massof tremendous life only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is by the cord and all obedient to one volition as the smallest insect so that when i shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities andconcentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster when i shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats i trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity and be readyto abide by this that though the sperm whale stove a passage throughthe isthmus of darien and mixed the atlantic with the pacific you wouldnot elevate one hair of your eye brow for unless you own the whale you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in truth but cleartruth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter how smallthe chances for the provincials then what befell the weakling youthlifting the dread goddess s veil at lais chapter the great heidelburgh tunnow comes the baling of the case but to comprehend it aright you must know something of the curious internal structureof the thing operated upon regarding the sperm whale s head as a solid oblong you may on an inclined plane sideways divide it into two quoins whereofthe lower is the bony structure forming the cranium and jaws and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones its broad forwardend forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale at the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin and then you have two almost equal parts which before were naturallydivided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance quoin is not a euclidean term it belongs to the purenautical mathematics i know not that it has been defined before a quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in havingits sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side instead of the mutual tapering of both sides the lower subdivided part called the junk is one immensehoneycomb of oil formed by the crossing and recrossing into ten thousand infiltrated cells of tough elastic white fibresthroughout its whole extent the upper part known as the case may be regarded as the great heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale and as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front so the whale s vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strangedevices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun moreover as that of heidelburgh was always replenishedwith the most excellent of the wines of the rhenish valleys so the tun of the whale contains by far the most preciousof all his oily vintages namely the highly prized spermaceti in its absolutely pure limpid and odoriferous state nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other partof the creature though in life it remains perfectly fluid yet upon exposure to the air after death it soon beginsto concrete sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water a large whale s case generally yields about five hundredgallons of sperm though from unavoidable circumstances considerable of it is spilled leaks and dribbles away or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish businessof securing what you can i know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tunwas coated within but in superlative richness that coating couldnot possibly have compared with the silken pearl colored membrane like the lining of a fine pelisse forming the inner surfaceof the sperm whale s case it will have been seen that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whaleembraces the entire length of the entire top of the head and since as has been elsewhere set forth the head embracesone third of the whole length of the creature then settingthat length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale you have more than twenty six feet for the depth of the tun when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship s side as in decapitating the whale the operator s instrument isbrought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequentlyforced into the spermaceti magazine he has therefore to beuncommonly heedful lest a careless untimely stroke should invadethe sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents it is this decapitated end of the head also which is atlast elevated out of the water and retained in that positionby the enormous cutting tackles whose hempen combinations on one side make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter thus much being said attend now i pray you to that marvellous and in this particular instance almost fatal operation wherebythe sperm whale s great heidelburgh tun is tapped chapter cistern and bucketsnimble as a cat tashtego mounts aloft and without altering hiserect posture runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard arm to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted tun he hascarried with him a light tackle called a whip consisting ofonly two parts travelling through a single sheaved block securing this block so that it hangs down from the yard arm he swings one end of the rope till it is caught and firmly heldby a hand on the deck then hand over hand down the other part the indian drops through the air till dexterously he landson the summit of the head there still high elevated abovethe rest of the company to whom he vivaciously cries he seems some turkish muezzin calling the good people to prayersfrom the top of a tower a short handled sharp spade beingsent up to him he diligently searches for the proper placeto begin breaking into the tun in this business he proceedsvery heedfully like a treasure hunter in some old house sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in by the time this cautious search is over a stout ironbound bucket precisely like a well bucket has been attached to one endof the whip while the other end being stretched acrossthe deck is there held by two or three alert hands these last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the indian to whom another person has reached up a very long pole inserting this pole into the bucket tashtego downwardguides the bucket into the tun till it entirely disappears then giving the word to the seamen at the whip up comes thebucket again all bubbling like a dairy maid s pail of new milk carefully lowered from its height the full freighted vessel iscaught by an appointed hand and quickly emptied into a large tub then remounting aloft it again goes through the same rounduntil the deep cistern will yield no more towards the end tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder and deeperand deeper into the tun until some twenty feet of the polehave gone down now the people of the pequod had been baling some time in this way several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm when all atonce a queer accident happened whether it was that tashtego that wild indian was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a momenthis one handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy or whether the evil one himself would have it to fall out so without stating his particular reasons how it was exactly there is no telling now but on a sudden as the eightiethor ninetieth bucket came suckingly up my god poor tashtego like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well dropped head foremost down into this great tun of heidelburgh and with a horrible oily gurgling went clean out of sight man overboard cried daggoo who amid the general consternationfirst came to his senses swing the bucket this way and putting one foot into it so as the better to secure hisslippery hand hold on the whip itself the hoisters ran him high upto the top of the head almost before tashtego could have reachedits interior bottom meantime there was a terrible tumult looking over the side they saw the before lifeless head throbbingand heaving just below the surface of the sea as if that momentseized with some momentous idea whereas it was only the poorindian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilousdepth to which he had sunk at this instant while daggoo on the summit of the head was clearingthe whip which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles a sharp cracking noise was heard and to the unspeakable horrorof all one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg the one remaining hook upon which the entire strain now depended seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way an eventstill more likely from the violent motions of the head come down come down yelled the seamen to daggoo but with one handholding on to the heavy tackles so that if the head should drop he would still remain suspended the negro having cleared the foul line rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well meaning thatthe buried harpooneer should grasp it and so be hoisted out in heaven s name man cried stubb are you ramminghome a cartridge there avast how will that help him jamming that iron bound bucket on top of his head avast will ye stand clear of the tackle cried a voice like the burstingof a rocket almost in the same instant with a thunder boom the enormousmass dropped into the sea like niagara s table rock intothe whirlpool the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it to far down her glittering copper and all caught their breath as half swinging now over the sailors heads and nowover the water daggoo through a thick mist of spray was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles while poor buried alive tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottomof the sea but hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away when a naked figure with a boardingsword in his hand was for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks the next a loud splash announced that my brave queequeg haddived to the rescue one packed rush was made to the side and every eye counted every ripple as moment followed moment and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen some hands now jumped into a boat alongside and pushed a littleoff from the ship ha ha cried daggoo all at once from his now quiet swinging perch overhead and looking further off from the side we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves a sight strangeto see as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave both both it is both cried daggoo again with a joyful shout and soon after queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand and with the other clutching the long hair of the indian drawn intothe waiting boat they were quickly brought to the deck but tashtegowas long in coming to and queequeg did not look very brisk now how had this noble rescue been accomplished why diving afterthe slowly descending head queequeg with his keen sword had madeside lunges near its bottom so as to scuttle a large hole there then dropping his sword had thrust his long arm far inwardsand upwards and so hauled out our poor tash by the head he averred that upon first thrusting in for him a leg was presented but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be and mightoccasion great trouble he had thrust back the leg and by adexterous heave and toss had wrought a somerset upon the indian so that with the next trial he came forth in the good old way head foremost as for the great head itself that was doingas well as could be expected and thus through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of queequeg the deliverance or rather delivery of tashtego was successfullyaccomplished in the teeth too of the most untoward and apparentlyhopeless impediments which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing riding and rowing i know that this queer adventure of the gay header s will be sureto seem incredible to some landsmen though they themselves may haveeither seen or heard of some one s falling into a cistern ashore an accident which not seldom happens and with much less reason toothan the indian s considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curbof the sperm whale s well but peradventure it may be sagaciously urged how is this we thought the tissued infiltrated head of the sperm whale was the lightest and most corky part about him and yet thou makestit sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself we have thee there not at all but i have ye for at the time poortash fell in the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well a double welded hammered substance as i have before said much heavier thanthe sea water and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost but the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the presentinstance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head remainingundetached from it so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed affording queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetricson the run as you may say yes it was a running delivery so it was now had tashtego perished in that head it had been a veryprecious perishing smothered in the very whitest and daintiestof fragrant spermaceti coffined hearsed and tombed inthe secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale only one sweeter end can readily be recalled the deliciousdeath of an ohio honey hunter who seeking honey in the crotchof a hollow tree found such exceeding store of it that leaningtoo far over it sucked him in so that he died embalmed how many think ye have likewise fallen into plato s honey head and sweetly perished there chapter the prairieto scan the lines of his face or feel the bumps on the head ofthis leviathan this is a thing which no physiognomist or phrenologisthas as yet undertaken such an enterprise would seem almost ashopeful as for lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the rockof gibraltar or for gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulatedthe dome of the pantheon still in that famous work of his lavater not only treats of the various faces of men but also attentivelystudies the faces of horses birds serpents and fish and dwellsin detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein nor have gall and his disciple spurzheim failed to throw out some hintstouching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man therefore though i am but ill qualified for a pioneer in the applicationof these two semi sciences to the whale i will do my endeavor i try all things i achieve what i can physiognomically regarded the sperm whale is an anomalous creature he has no proper nose and since the nose is the centraland most conspicuous of the features and since it perhapsmost modifies and finally controls their combined expression hence it would seem that its entire absence as an external appendage must very largely affect the countenance of the whale for as in landscape gardening a spire cupola monument or tower of some sort is deemed almost indispensable tothe completion of the scene so no face can be physiognomicallyin keeping without the elevated open work belfry of the nose dash the nose from phidias s marble jove and what asorry remainder nevertheless leviathan is of so mightya magnitude all his proportions are so stately that the samedeficiency which in the sculptured jove were hideous in him is no blemish at all nay it is an added grandeur a nose to the whale would have been impertinent as on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast headin your jollyboat your noble conceptions of him are neverinsulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled a pestilent conceit which so often will insist upon obtrudingeven when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne in some particulars perhaps the most imposing physiognomical viewto be had of the sperm whale is that of the full front of his head this aspect is sublime in thought a fine human brow is like the east when troubled withthe morning in the repose of the pasture the curled brow of the bullhas a touch of the grand in it pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles the elephant s brow is majestic human or animal the mysticalbrow is as that great golden seal affixed by the german emperorsto their decrees it signifies god done this day by my hand but in most creatures nay in man himself very often the browis but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line few are the foreheads which like shakespeare s or melancthon s riseso high and descend so low that the eyes themselves seem clear eternal tideless mountain lakes and all above them in the forehead s wrinkles you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to drink as the highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer but in the great sperm whale this high and mighty god like dignityinherent in the brow is so immensely amplified that gazing on it in that full front view you feel the deity and the dread powersmore forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature for you see no one point precisely not one distinct feature is revealed no nose eyes ears or mouth no face he has none proper nothing butthat one broad firmament of a forehead pleated with riddles dumbly lowering with the doom of boats and ships and men nor in profile does this wondrous brow diminish though that wayviewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so in profile you plainly perceive that horizontal semi crescentic depressionin the forehead s middle which in a man is lavater s mark of genius but how genius in the sperm whale has the sperm whaleever written a book spoken a speech no his great geniusis declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it it is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence and this remindsme that had the great sperm whale been known to the young orient world he would have been deified by their child magian thoughts they deified the crocodile of the nile because the crocodileis tongueless and the sperm whale has no tongue or at leastit is so exceedingly small as to be incapable of protrusion if hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shall lureback to their birth right the merry may day gods of old and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky in the now unhaunted hill then be sure exalted to jove shigh seat the great sperm whale shall lord it champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics but there is no champollion to decipher the egypt of everyman s and every being s face physiognomy like every other human science is but a passing fable if then sir william jones who read in thirty languages could not read the simplestpeasant s face in its profounder and more subtle meanings how may unlettered ishmael hope to read the awful chaldeeof the sperm whale s brow i but put that brow before you read if it if you can chapter the nutif the sperm whale be physiognomically a sphinx to the phrenologist hisbrain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square in the full grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feetin length unhinge the lower jaw and the side view of this skullis as the side view of a moderately inclined plane resting throughouton a level base but in life as we have elsewhere seen this inclinedplane is angularly filled up and almost squared by the enormoussuperincumbent mass of the junk and sperm at the high end the skullforms a crater to bed that part of the mass while under the long floorof this crater in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in lengthand as many in depth reposes the mere handful of this monster s brain the brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life it is hidden away behind its vast outworks like the innermost citadelwithin the amplified fortifications of quebec so like a choice casketis it secreted in him that i have known some whalemen who peremptorilydeny that the sperm whale has any other brain than that palpablesemblance of one formed by the cubic yards of his sperm magazine lying in strange folds courses and convolutions to their apprehensions it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regardthat mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence it is plain then that phrenologically the head of this leviathan in the creature s living intact state is an entire delusion as for his true brain you can then see no indications of it nor feel any the whale like all things that are mighty wears a false brow to the common world if you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rearview of its rear end which is the high end you will be struckby its resemblance to the human skull beheld in the same situation and from the same point of view indeed place this reversed skull scaled down to the human magnitude among a plate of men s skulls and you would involuntarily confound it with them and remarkingthe depressions on one part of its summit in phrenological phraseyou would say this man had no self esteem and no veneration and by those negations considered along with the affirmative factof his prodigious bulk and power you can best form to yourselfthe truest though not the most exhilarating conception of whatthe most exalted potency is but if from the comparative dimensions of the whale s proper brain you deem it incapable of being adequately charted then ihave another idea for you if you attentively regard almostany quadruped s spine you will be struck with the resemblanceof its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper it is a german conceit that the vertebrae are absolutelyundeveloped skulls but the curious external resemblance i take it the germans were not the first men to perceive a foreign friend once pointed it out to me in the skeleton of a foehe had slain and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying in a sort of basso relieve the beaked prow of his canoe now i consider that the phrenologists have omitted an importantthing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellumthrough the spinal canal for i believe that much of aman s character will be found betokened in his backbone i would rather feel your spine than your skull whoever you are a thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul i rejoice in my spine as in the firm audacious staff of that flagwhich i fling half out to the world apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm whale his cranialcavity is continuous with the first neck vertebra and in that vertebrathe bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across being eightin height and of a triangular figure with the base downwards as it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity now of course this canal is filled with much the same strangelyfibrous substance the spinal cord as the brain and directlycommunicates with the brain and what is still more for many feetafter emerging from the brain s cavity the spinal cord remainsof an undecreasing girth almost equal to that of the brain under all these circumstances would it be unreasonable to survey and mapout the whale s spine phrenologically for viewed in this light the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more thancompensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord but leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists i would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment in referenceto the sperm whale s hump this august hump if i mistake not rises over one of the larger vertebrae and is therefore in some sort the outer convex mould of it from its relative situation then i should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitablenessin the sperm whale and that the great monster is indomitable you will yet have reason to know chapter the pequod meets the virginthe predestinated day arrived and we duly met the shipjungfrau derick de deer master of bremen at one time the greatest whaling people in the world the dutchand germans are now among the least but here and there at very wideintervals of latitude and longitude you still occasionally meetwith their flag in the pacific for some reason the jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects while yet some distance from the pequod she rounded to and droppinga boat her captain was impelled towards us impatiently standingin the bows instead of the stern what has he in his hand there cried starbuck pointing to somethingwavingly held by the german impossible a lamp feeder not that said stubb no no it s a coffee pot mr starbuck he s coming off to make us our coffee is the yarman don t you seethat big tin can there alongside of him that s his boiling water oh he s all right is the yarman go along with you cried flask it s a lamp feeder and an oil can he s out of oil and has come a begging however curious it may seem for an oil ship to be borrowingoil on the whale ground and however much it may invertedlycontradict the old proverb about carrying coals to newcastle yet sometimes such a thing really happens and in the presentcase captain derick de deer did indubitably conduct a lamp feederas flask did declare as he mounted the deck ahab abruptly accosted him without atall heeding what he had in his hand but in his broken lingo the german soon evinced his complete ignorance of the white whale immediately turning the conversation to his lamp feeder and oil can with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock atnight in profound darkness his last drop of bremen oil being gone and not a single flying fish yet captured to supply the deficiency concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the fisheryis technically called a clean one that is an empty one welldeserving the name of jungfrau or the virgin his necessities supplied derick departed but he had not gainedhis ship s side when whales were almost simultaneously raised fromthe mast heads of both vessels and so eager for the chase was derick that without pausing to put his oil can and lamp feeder aboard he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp feeders now the game having risen to leeward he and the other three german boatsthat soon followed him had considerably the start of the pequod s keels there were eight whales an average pod aware of their danger they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness they left a great wide wake as though continually unrolling a greatwide parchment upon the sea full in this rapid wake and many fathoms in the rear swam a huge humped old bull which by his comparatively slow progress as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations over growing him seemed afflicted with the jaundice or some other infirmity whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance seemed questionable for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be atall social nevertheless he stuck to their wake though indeed theirback water must have retarded him because the white bone or swellat his broad muzzle was a dashed one like the swell formed when twohostile currents meet his spout was short slow and laborious coming forth with a choking sort of gush and spending itselfin torn shreds followed by strange subterranean commotions in him which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity causing the waters behind him to upbubble who s got some paregoric said stubb he has the stomach ache i m afraid lord think of having half an acre of stomach ache adverse winds are holding mad christmas in him boys it s the first foul wind i ever knew to blow from astern but look did ever whale yaw so before it must be he s lost his tiller as an overladen indiaman bearing down the hindostan coast with a deckload of frightened horses careens buries rolls and wallows onher way so did this old whale heave his aged bulk and now and thenpartly turning over on his cumbrous rib ends expose the causeof his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin whether he had lost that fin in battle or had been born without it it were hard to say only wait a bit old chap and i ll give ye a sling for thatwounded arm cried cruel flask pointing to the whale line near him mind he don t sling thee with it cried starbuck give way or the german will have him with one intent all the combined rival boats were pointedfor this one fish because not only was he the largest and therefore the most valuable whale but he was nearest to them and the other whales were going with such great velocity moreover as almost to defy pursuit for the time at this juncture the pequod s keels had shot by the three german boats last lowered but from the great start he had had derick s boat still ledthe chase though every moment neared by his foreign rivals the only thing they feared was that from being alreadyso nigh to his mark he would be enabled to dart his ironbefore they could completely overtake and pass him as for derick he seemed quite confident that this would be the case and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp feederat the other boats the ungracious and ungrateful dog cried starbuck he mocks and daresme with the very poor box i filled for him not five minutes ago then in his old intense whisper give way greyhounds dog to it i tell ye what it is men cried stubb to his crew it s against myreligion to get mad but i d like to eat that villainous yarman pull won t ye are ye going to let that rascal beat ye do ye love brandy a hogshead of brandy then to the best man come why don t some of yeburst a blood vessel who s that been dropping an anchor overboard we don t budge an inch we re becalmed halloo here s grass growingin the boat s bottom and by the lord the mast there s budding this won t do boys look at that yarman the short and long ofit is men will ye spit fire or not oh see the suds he makes cried flask dancing up and down whata hump oh do pile on the beef lays like a log oh my lads do spring slap jacks and quahogs for supper you know my lads baked clams and muffins oh do do spring he s a hundred barreler don t lose him now don t oh don t see that yarman oh won t ye pullfor your duff my lads such a sog such a sogger don t ye love sperm there goes three thousand dollars men a bank a whole bank the bank of england oh do do do what s that yarman about now at this moment derick was in the act of pitching his lamp feederat the advancing boats and also his oil can perhaps with the doubleview of retarding his rivals way and at the same time economicallyaccelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss the unmannerly dutch dogger cried stubb pull now men like fifty thousand line of battle ship loads of red haired devils what d ye say tashtego are you the man to snap your spine intwo and twenty pieces for the honor of old gayhead what d ye say i say pull like god dam cried the indian fiercely but evenly incited by the taunts of the german the pequod sthree boats now began ranging almost abreast and so disposed momentarily neared him in that fine loose chivalrous attitudeof the headsman when drawing near to his prey the three mates stoodup proudly occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilaratingcry of there she slides now hurrah for the white ash breeze down with the yarman sail over him but so decided an original start had derick had that spiteof all their gallantry he would have proved the victorin this race had not a righteous judgment descended upon himin a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman while this clumsy lubber was striving to free his white ash and while in consequence derick s boat was nigh to capsizing and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage that wasa good time for starbuck stubb and flask with a shout they took a mortal start forwards and slantingly ranged upon the german s quarter an instant more and all four boatswere diagonically in the whale s immediate wake while stretchingfrom them on both sides was the foaming swell that he made it was a terrific most pitiable and maddening sight the whale was now going head out and sending his spoutbefore him in a continual tormented jet while his one poorfin beat his side in an agony of fright now to this hand now to that he yawed in his faltering flight and still atevery billow that he broke he spasmodically sank in the sea or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin so have i seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted brokencircles in the air vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks but the bird has a voice and with plaintive cries will makeknown her fear but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea was chained up and enchanted in him he had no voice save that choking respiration through his spiracle and thismade the sight of him unspeakably pitiable while still in his amazing bulk portcullis jaw and omnipotent tail there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the pequod sboats the advantage and rather than be thus foiled of his game derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusuallylong dart ere the last chance would for ever escape but no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke than allthree tigers queequeg tashtego daggoo instinctively sprangto their feet and standing in a diagonal row simultaneously pointedtheir barbs and darted over the head of the german harpooneer their three nantucket irons entered the whale blinding vaporsof foam and white fire the three boats in the first fury of thewhale s headlong rush bumped the german s aside with such force that both derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out and sailed over by the three flying keels don t be afraid my butter boxes cried stubb casting a passingglance upon them as he shot by ye ll be picked up presently all right i saw some sharks astern st bernard s dogs you know relieve distressed travellers hurrah this is the way to sail now every keel a sunbeam hurrah here we go like three tinkettles at the tail of a mad cougar this puts me in mindof fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain makes the wheelspokes fly boys when you fasten to him that way and there s danger of being pitched out too when you strike a hill hurrah this is the way a fellow feels when he s goingto davy jones all a rush down an endless inclined plane hurrah this whale carries the everlasting mail but the monster s run was a brief one giving a sudden gasp he tumultuously sounded with a grating rush the three lines flew roundthe loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid soundingwould soon exhaust the lines that using all their dexterous might they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on till at last owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead linedchocks of the boats whence the three ropes went straightdown into the blue the gunwales of the bows were almost evenwith the water while the three sterns tilted high in the air and the whale soon ceasing to sound for some time theyremained in that attitude fearful of expending more line though the position was a little ticklish but though boats havebeen taken down and lost in this way yet it is this holding on as it is called this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his liveflesh from the back this it is that often torments the leviathaninto soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes yet not to speak of the peril of the thing it is to be doubtedwhether this course is always the best for it is but reasonableto presume that the longer the stricken whale stays under water the more he is exhausted because owing to the enormous surface of him in a full grown sperm whale something less than square feet the pressure of the water is immense we all know what an astonishingatmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under even here above ground in the air how vast then the burden of a whale bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean it must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres one whalemanhas estimated it at the weight of twenty line of battle ships with all their guns and stores and men on board as the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea gazing down into its eternal blue noon and as not a single groanor cry of any sort nay not so much as a ripple or a bubblecame up from its depths what landsman would have thought that beneath all that silence and placidity the utmostmonster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows seems it credible that by three such thin threads the greatleviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock suspended and to what to three bits of board is thisthe creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said canst thoufill his skin with barbed irons or his head with fish spears the sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon he esteemeth iron as straw the arrow cannot make him flee darts are counted as stubble he laugheth at the shaking of a spear this the creature this he oh that unfulfilments should follow the prophets for with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea to hide him from the pequod s fishspears in that sloping afternoon sunlight the shadows that the three boats sentdown beneath the surface must have been long enough and broad enoughto shade half xerxes army who can tell how appalling to the woundedwhale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head stand by men he stirs cried starbuck as the three lines suddenlyvibrated in the water distinctly conducting upwards to them as by magnetic wires the life and death throbs of the whale so that every oarsman felt them in his seat the next moment relieved in a great part from the downward strain at the bows the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards as a small icefield will when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea haul in haul in cried starbuck again he s rising the lines of which hardly an instant before not one hand sbreadth could have been gained were now in long quick coilsflung back all dripping into the boats and soon the whalebroke water within two ship s length of the hunters his motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion in most land animals there are certain valves or flood gatesin many of their veins whereby when wounded the blood is insome degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions not so with the whale one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non valvular structure of the blood vessels so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressureof water at a great distance below the surface his lifemay be said to pour from him in incessant streams yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him and so distantand numerous its interior fountains that he will keepthus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period even as in a drought a river will flow whose source isin the well springs of far off and indiscernible hills even now when the boats pulled upon this whale and perilouslydrew over his swaying flukes and the lances were darted into him they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound which kept continually playing while the natural spout holein his head was only at intervals however rapid sending itsaffrighted moisture into the air from this last vent no bloodyet came because no vital part of him had thus far been struck his life as they significantly call it was untouched as the boats now more closely surrounded him the whole upper part of hisform with much of it that is ordinarily submerged was plainly revealed his eyes or rather the places where his eyes had been were beheld as strange misgrown masses gather in the knot holes of the noblestoaks when prostrate so from the points which the whale s eyes hadonce occupied now protruded blind bulbs horribly pitiable to see but pity there was none for all his old age and his one arm and his blind eyes he must die the death and be murdered in order to light the gay bridals and other merry makings of men and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditionalinoffensiveness by all to all still rolling in his blood at lasthe partially disclosed a strangely discolored bunch or protuberance the size of a bushel low down on the flank a nice spot cried flask just let me prick him there once avast cried starbuck there s no need of that but humane starbuck was too late at the instant of the dartan ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound and goaded by itinto more than sufferable anguish the whale now spoutingthick blood with swift fury blindly darted at the craft bespattering them and their glorying crews all over withshowers of gore capsizing flask s boat and marring the bows it was his death stroke for by this time so spent was he by lossof blood that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made lay panting on his side impotently flapped with his stumped fin then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world turned up the white secrets of his belly lay like a log and died it was most piteous that last expiring spout as when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn offfrom some mighty fountain and with half stifled melancholygurglings the spray column lowers and lowers to the ground so the last long dying spout of the whale soon while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled immediately by starbuck s orders lines were secured to it atdifferent points so that ere long every boat was a buoy the sunkenwhale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords by very heedful management when the ship drew nigh the whale wastransferred to her side and was strongly secured there by the stiffestfluke chains for it was plain that unless artificially upheld the body would at once sink to the bottom it so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbeddedin his flesh on the lower part of the bunch before described but as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the deadbodies of captured whales with the flesh perfectly healedaround them and no prominence of any kind to denote their place therefore there must needs have been some other unknown reasonin the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to but still more curious was the fact of a lance head of stone beingfound in him not far from the buried iron the flesh perfectlyfirm about it who had darted that stone lance and when it might have been darted by some nor west indian long beforeamerica was discovered what other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinetthere is no telling but a sudden stop was put to further discoveries by the ship s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea owing to the body s immensely increasing tendency to sink however starbuck who had the ordering of affairs hung on to itto the last hung on to it so resolutely indeed that when at lengththe ship would have been capsized if still persisting in lockingarms with the body then when the command was given to break clearfrom it such was the immovable strain upon the timber heads to whichthe fluke chains and cables were fastened that it was impossibleto cast them off meantime everything in the pequod was aslant to cross to the other side of the deck was like walking upthe steep gabled roof of a house the ship groaned and gasped many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were startedfrom their places by the unnatural dislocation in vain handspikesand crows were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke chains to prythem adrift from the timberheads and so low had the whale now settledthat the submerged ends could not be at all approached while everymoment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk and the ship seemed on the point of going over hold on hold on won t ye cried stubb to the body don t be in such a devil of a hurry to sink by thunder men we must do something or go for it no use prying there avast i say with your handspikes and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen knife and cutthe big chains knife aye aye cried queequeg and seizing the carpenter sheavy hatchet he leaned out of a porthole and steel to iron began slashing at the largest fluke chains but a few strokes full of sparks were given when the exceeding strain effected the rest with a terrific snap every fastening went adrift the ship righted the carcase sank now this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killedsperm whale is a very curious thing nor has any fisherman yetadequately accounted for it usually the dead sperm whalefloats with great buoyancy with its side or belly considerablyelevated above the surface if the only whales that thus sankwere old meagre and broken hearted creatures their padsof lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic then you might with some reason assert that this sinking iscaused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him but it is not so for young whales in the highest health and swelling with noble aspirations prematurely cut offin the warm flush and may of life with all their panting lardabout them even these brawny buoyant heroes do sometimes sink be it said however that the sperm whale is far lessliable to this accident than any other species where one of that sort go down twenty right whales do this difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no smalldegree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale his venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton from this incumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free but thereare instances where after the lapse of many hours or several days the sunken whale again rises more buoyant than in life but the reason of this is obvious gases are generated in him he swells to a prodigious magnitude becomes a sort of animal balloon a line of battle ship could hardly keep him under then in the shore whaling on soundings among the bays of new zealand when a right whale gives token of sinking they fasten buoysto him with plenty of rope so that when the body has gone down they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again it was not long after the sinking of the body that a crywas heard from the pequod s mast heads announcing that thejungfrau was again lowering her boats though the only spoutin sight was that of a fin back belonging to the species ofuncapturable whales because of its incredible power of swimming nevertheless the fin back s spout is so similar to the sperm whale s that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it and consequently derick and all his host were now in valiantchase of this unnearable brute the virgin crowding all sail made after her four young keels and thus they all disappearedfar to leeward still in bold hopeful chase oh many are the fin backs and many are the dericks my friend chapter the honor and glory of whalingthere are some enterprises in which a careful disorderlinessis the true method the more i dive into this matter of whaling and push my researchesup to the very spring head of it so much the more am i impressedwith its great honorableness and antiquity and especially when ifind so many great demi gods and heroes prophets of all sorts who one way or other have shed distinction upon it i am transportedwith the reflection that i myself belong though but subordinately to so emblazoned a fraternity the gallant perseus a son of jupiter was the first whaleman and to the eternal honor of our calling be it said that the firstwhale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with anysordid intent those were the knightly days of our profession when we only bore arms to succor the distressed and not to fillmen s lamp feeders every one knows the fine story of perseusand andromeda how the lovely andromeda the daughter of a king was tied to a rock on the sea coast and as leviathan was inthe very act of carrying her off perseus the prince of whalemen intrepidly advancing harpooned the monster and deliveredand married the maid it was an admirable artistic exploit rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day inasmuch as this leviathan was slain at the very first dart and let no man doubt this arkite story for in the ancient joppa now jaffa on the syrian coast in one of the pagan temples there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale which the city s legends and all the inhabitants assertedto be the identical bones of the monster that perseus slew when the romans took joppa the same skeleton was carried to italyin triumph what seems most singular and suggestively importantin this story is this it was from joppa that jonah set sail akin to the adventure of perseus and andromeda indeed by somesupposed to be indirectly derived from it is that famous storyof st george and the dragon which dragon i maintain to havebeen a whale for in many old chronicles whales and dragonsare strangely jumbled together and often stand for each other thou art as a lion of the waters and as a dragon ofthe sea said ezekiel hereby plainly meaning a whale in truth some versions of the bible use that word itself besides it would much subtract from the glory of the exploithad st george but encountered a crawling reptile of the land instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep any man may kill a snake but only a perseus a st george a coffin have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us for though the creature encountered by that valiant whalemanof old is vaguely represented of a griffin like shape and though the battle is depicted on land and the sainton horseback yet considering the great ignorance of those times when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists and considering that as in perseus case st george swhale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach and considering that the animal ridden by st george might havebeen only a large seal or sea horse bearing all this in mind it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacredlegend and the ancientest draughts of the scene to hold thisso called dragon no other than the great leviathan himself in fact placed before the strict and piercing truth this whole story will fare like that fish flesh and fowlidol of the philistines dagon by name who being plantedbefore the ark of israel his horse s head and both the palmsof his hands fell off from him and only the stump or fishypart of him remained thus then one of our own noble stamp even a whaleman is the tutelary guardian of england and by good rights we harpooneers of nantucket should beenrolled in the most noble order of st george and therefore let not the knights of that honorable company none of whom i venture to say have ever had to do with a whale like theirgreat patron let them never eye a nantucketer with disdain since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are muchbetter entitled to st george s decoration than they whether to admit hercules among us or not concerning this i longremained dubious for though according to the greek mythologies that antique crockett and kit carson that brawny doerof rejoicing good deeds was swallowed down and thrown upby a whale still whether that strictly makes a whalemanof him that might be mooted it nowhere appears that he everactually harpooned his fish unless indeed from the inside nevertheless he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman at any rate the whale caught him if he did not the whale i claim him for one of our clan but by the best contradictory authorities this grecian storyof hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the stillmore ancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale and vice versa certainly they are very similar if i claim the demigod then why not the prophet nor do heroes saints demigods and prophets alone comprisethe whole roll of our order our grand master is still to be named for like royal kings of old times we find the head watersof our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves that wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the shaster which gives us the dread vishnoo one of the three personsin the godhead of the hindoos gives us this divine vishnoohimself for our lord vishnoo who by the first of his tenearthly incarnations has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale when brahma or the god of gods saith the shaster resolved torecreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions he gave birth to vishnoo to preside over the work but the vedas or mystical books whose perusal would seem to have been indispensableto vishnoo before beginning the creation and which thereforemust have contained something in the shape of practical hintsto young architects these vedas were lying at the bottom ofthe waters so vishnoo became incarnate in a whale and soundingdown in him to the uttermost depths rescued the sacred volumes was not this vishnoo a whaleman then even as a man who ridesa horse is called a horseman perseus st george hercules jonah and vishnoo there sa member roll for you what club but the whaleman s can headoff like that chapter jonah historically regardedreference was made to the historical story of jonah and the whalein the preceding chapter now some nantucketers rather distrust thishistorical story of jonah and the whale but then there were somesceptical greeks and romans who standing out from the orthodox pagansof their times equally doubted the story of hercules and the whale and arion and the dolphin and yet their doubting those traditionsdid not make those traditions one whit the less facts for all that one old sag harbor whaleman s chief reason for questioning the hebrewstory was this he had one of those quaint old fashioned bibles embellished with curious unscientific plates one of which representedjonah s whale with two spouts in his head a peculiarity only truewith respect to a species of the leviathan the right whale and the varieties of that order concerning which the fishermenhave this saying a penny roll would choke him his swallow is sovery small but to this bishop jebb s anticipative answer is ready it is not necessary hints the bishop that we consider jonah as tombed inthe whale s belly but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth and this seems reasonable enough in the good bishop for truly the right whale s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist tables and comfortably seat all the players possibly too jonah mighthave ensconced himself in a hollow tooth but on second thoughts the right whale is toothless another reason which sag harbor he went by that name urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated bodyand the whale s gastric juices but this objection likewise fallsto the ground because a german exegetist supposes that jonahmust have taken refuge in the floating body of a dead whale even as the french soldiers in the russian campaign turnedtheir dead horses into tents and crawled into them besides it has been divined by other continental commentators that when jonah was thrown overboard from the joppa ship he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by some vessel with a whale for a figure head and i would add possibly called the whale as some craft are nowadayschristened the shark the gull the eagle nor havethere been wanting learned exegetists who have opinedthat the whale mentioned in the book of jonah merely meanta life preserver an inflated bag of wind which the endangeredprophet swam to and so was saved from a watery doom poor sag harbor therefore seems worsted all round but he had still another reason for his want of faith it was this if i remember right jonah was swallowedby the whale in the mediterranean sea and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days journey of nineveh a city on the tigris very much more than three days journey across from the nearest point of the mediterranean coast how is that but was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet withinthat short distance of nineveh yes he might have carried himround by the way of the cape of good hope but not to speakof the passage through the whole length of the mediterranean and another passage up the persian gulf and red sea such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigationof all africa in three days not to speak of the tigris waters near the site of nineveh being too shallow for any whale to swim in besides this idea of jonah s weathering the cape of good hopeat so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of thatgreat headland from bartholomew diaz its reputed discoverer and so make modern history a liar but all these foolish arguments of old sag harbor only evinced hisfoolish pride of reason a thing still more reprehensible in him seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up fromthe sun and the sea i say it only shows his foolish impious pride and abominable devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy for by a portuguese catholic priest this very idea of jonah s going tonineveh via the cape of good hope was advanced as a signal magnificationof the general miracle and so it was besides to this day the highly enlightened turks devoutly believe in the historical storyof jonah and some three centuries ago an english traveller in oldharris s voyages speaks of a turkish mosque built in honor of jonah in which mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil chapter pitchpolingto make them run easily and swiftly the axles of carriagesare anointed and for much the same purpose some whalers performan analogous operation upon their boat they grease the bottom nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage considering thatoil and water are hostile that oil is a sliding thing and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat and one morningnot long after the german ship jungfrau disappeared took more thancustomary pains in that occupation crawling under its bottom where it hung over the side and rubbing in the unctuousness as thoughdiligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft s bald keel he seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment nor did it remain unwarranted by the event towards noon whales were raised but so soon as the ship saileddown to them they turned and fled with swift precipitancy a disordered flight as of cleopatra s barges from actium nevertheless the boats pursued and stubb s was foremost by great exertion tashtego at last succeeded in plantingone iron but the stricken whale without at all sounding still continued his horizontal flight with added fleetness such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooneror later inevitably extract it it became imperative to lancethe flying whale or be content to lose him but to haul the boatup to his flank was impossible he swam so fast and furious what then remained of all the wondrous devices and dexterities the sleights of hand andcountless subtleties to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called pitchpoling small sword or broad sword in all its exercises boasts nothing like it it is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the longlance is accurately darted from a violently rocking jerking boat under extreme headway steel and wood included the entire spearis some ten or twelve feet in length the staff is much slighterthan that of the harpoon and also of a lighter material pine it isfurnished with a small rope called a warp of considerable length by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting but before going further it is important to mention here that thoughthe harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance yet itis seldom done and when done is still less frequently successful on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoonas compared with the lance which in effect become serious drawbacks as a general thing therefore you must first get fast to a whale before any pitchpoling comes into play look now at stubb a man who from his humorous deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies was specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling look at him he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat wrapt in fleecy foam the towing whale is forty feet ahead handling the long lance lightly glancing twice or thrice alongits length to see if it be exactly straight stubb whistlinglygathers up the coil of the warp in one hand so as to secureits free end in his grasp leaving the rest unobstructed then holding the lance full before his waistband s middle he levels it at the whale when covering him with it he steadily depresses the butt end in his hand thereby elevatingthe point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm fifteen feet in the air he minds you somewhat of a juggler balancing a long staff on his chin next moment with a rapid nameless impulse in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spansthe foaming distance and quivers in the life spot of the whale instead of sparkling water he now spouts red blood that drove the spigot out of him cried stubb tis july simmortal fourth all fountains must run wine today would now it were old orleans whiskey or old ohio or unspeakableold monongahela then tashtego lad i d have ye hold a canakinto the jet and we d drink round it yea verily hearts alive we d brew choice punch in the spread of his spout hole there and from that live punch bowl quaff the living stuff again and again to such gamesome talk the dexterous dart is repeated the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash the agonized whale goes into his flurry the tow line is slackened and the pitchpoler dropping astern folds his hands and mutely watchesthe monster die chapter the fountainthat for six thousand years and no one knows how many millionsof ages before the great whales should have been spouting all overthe sea and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep as with so many sprinkling or mistifying pots and that for somecenturies back thousands of hunters should have been close bythe fountain of the whale watching these sprinklings and spoutings that all this should be and yet that down to this blessed minute fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o clock p m of thissixteenth day of december a d it should still remaina problem whether these spoutings are after all really water or nothing but vapor this is surely a noteworthy thing let us then look at this matter along with some interestingitems contingent every one knows that by the peculiarcunning of their gills the finny tribes in general breathethe air which at all times is combined with the elementin which they swim hence a herring or a cod might livea century and never once raise its head above the surface but owing to his marked internal structure which gives himregular lungs like a human being s the whale can only liveby inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world but he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth for in his ordinary attitude the sperm whale s mouth is buriedat least eight feet beneath the surface and what is still more his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth no he breathesthrough his spiracle alone and this is on the top of his head if i say that in any creature breathing is only a functionindispensable to vitality inasmuch as it withdrawsfrom the air a certain element which being subsequentlybrought into contact with the blood imparts to the bloodits vivifying principle i do not think i shall err though i may possibly use some superfluous scientific words assume it and it follows that if all the blood in a man couldbe aerated with one breath he might then seal up his nostrilsand not fetch another for a considerable time that is to say he would then live without breathing anomalous as it may seem this is precisely the case with the whale who systematically lives by intervals his full hour and more when at the bottom without drawing a single breath or so much as in any wayinhaling a particle of air for remember he has no gills how is this between his ribs and on each side of his spinehe is supplied with a remarkable involved cretan labyrinthof vermicelli like vessels which vessels when he quitsthe surface are completely distended with oxygenated blood so that for an hour or more a thousand fathoms in the sea he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him just as the camelcrossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supplyof drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs the anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true seems the more cogent to me when i consider the otherwiseinexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having hisspoutings out as the fishermen phrase it this is what i mean if unmolested upon rising to the surface the sperm whale willcontinue there for a period of time exactly uniform with allhis other unmolested risings say he stays eleven minutes and jets seventy times that is respires seventy breaths then whenever he rises again he will be sure to have his seventybreaths over again to a minute now if after he fetches a fewbreaths you alarm him so that he sounds he will be alwaysdodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air and not till those seventy breaths are told will he finallygo down to stay out his full term below remark however that in different individuals these rates are different but in any one they are alike now why should the whalethus insist upon having his spoutings out unless it beto replenish his reservoir of air ere descending for good how obvious it is it too that this necessity for the whale srising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase for not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight not so much thy skill then o hunter as the great necessitiesthat strike the victory to thee in man breathing is incessantly going on one breath only servingfor two or three pulsations so that whatever other business he hasto attend to waking or sleeping breathe he must or die he will but the sperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sundayof his time it has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout hole if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water then i opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smellseems obliterated in him for the only thing about him that at all answersto his nose is that identical spout hole and being so clogged withtwo elements it could not be expected to have the power of smelling but owing to the mystery of the spout whether it be water or whether itbe vapor no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head sure it is nevertheless that the sperm whale has no proper olfactories but what does he want of them no roses no violets no cologne waterin the sea furthermore as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of hisspouting canal and as that long canal like the grand erie canal is furnished with a sort of locks that open and shut for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water therefore the whale has no voice unless you insult him by saying that when he so strangely rumbles he talks through his nose but then again what has the whale to say seldom have i knownany profound being that had anything to say to this world unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living oh happy that the world is such an excellent listener now the spouting canal of the sperm whale chiefly intended as itis for the conveyance of air and for several feet laid along horizontally just beneath the upper surface of his head and a little to one side this curious canal is very muchlike a gas pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street but the question returns whether this gas pipe is also a water pipe in other words whether the spout of the sperm whale is the merevapor of the exhaled breath or whether that exhaled breath ismixed with water taken in at the mouth and discharged throughthe spiracle it is certain that the mouth indirectly communicateswith the spouting canal but it cannot be proved that thisis for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be when in feeding he accidentally takes in water but the sperm whale sfood is far beneath the surface and there he cannot spouteven if he would besides if you regard him very closely and time him with your watch you will find that when unmolested there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jetsand the ordinary periods of respiration but why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject speak out you have seen him spout then declare whatthe spout is can you not tell water from air my dear sir in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things i have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all and as for this whale spout you might almost stand in it and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely the central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mistenveloping it and how can you certainly tell whether any waterfalls from it when always when you are close enough to a whaleto get a close view of his spout he is in a prodigious commotion the water cascading all around him and if at such timesyou should think that you really perceived drops of moisturein the spout how do you know that they are not merely condensedfrom its vapor or how do you know that they are not thoseidentical drops superficially lodged in the spout hole fissure which is countersunk into the summit of the whale s head for even when tranquilly swimming through the mid day sea in a calm with his elevated hump sun dried as a dromedary s in the desert even then the whale always carries a small basin of water onhis head as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavityin a rock filled up with rain nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touchingthe precise nature of the whale spout it will not do for himto be peering into it and putting his face in it you cannot gowith your pitcher to this fountain and fill it and bring it away for even when coming into slight contact with the outer vapory shreds of the jet which will often happen your skin willfeverishly smart from the acridness of the thing so touching it and i know one who coming into still closer contact with the spout whether with some scientific object in view or otherwise i cannot say the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm wherefore among whalemen the spout is deemed poisonous they try to evade it another thing i have heard it said and i do not much doubt it that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes it will blind you the wisest thing the investigator can do then it seems to me is to let this deadly spout alone still we can hypothesize even if we cannot prove and establish my hypothesis is this that the spout is nothing but mist and besides other reasons to this conclusion i am impelled by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimityof the sperm whale i account him no common shallow being inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never foundon soundings or near shores all other whales sometimes are he is both ponderous and profound and i am convinced that fromthe heads of all ponderous profound beings such as plato pyrrho the devil jupiter dante and so on there always goes up a certainsemi visible steam while in the act of thinking deep thoughts while composing a little treatise on eternity i had the curiosityto place a mirror before me and ere long saw reflected there a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head the invariable moisture of my hair while plunged in deep thought after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic of an august noon this seems an additional argument for the above supposition and how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty misty monster to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea his vast mild head overhung by a canopy of vapor engendered by his incommunicable contemplations and that vapor as you will sometimes see it glorified by a rainbow as if heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts for d ye see rainbows do not visit the clear air they only irradiate vapor and so through all the thickmists of the dim doubts in my mind divine intuitions nowand then shoot enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray and for this i thank god for all have doubts many deny but doubts or denials few along with them have intuitions doubts of all things earthly and intuitions of some things heavenly this combination makes neither believer nor infidel but makesa man who regards them both with equal eye chapter the tailother poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights less celestial i celebrate a tail reckoning the largest sized sperm whale s tail to begin atthat point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girthof a man it comprises upon its upper surface alone an areaof at least fifty square feet the compact round body of itsroot expands into two broad firm flat palms or flukes gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness at the crotch or junction these flukes slightly overlap then sidewaysrecede from each other like wings leaving a wide vacancy between in no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitelydefined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes at its utmost expansion in the full grown whale the tailwill considerably exceed twenty feet across the entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews but cut into it and you find that three distinct stratacompose it upper middle and lower the fibres in the upperand lower layers are long and horizontal those of the middle one very short and running crosswise between the outside layers this triune structure as much as anything else imparts powerto the tail to the student of old roman walls the middle layerwill furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles alwaysalternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strengthof the masonry but as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woofof muscular fibres and filaments which passing on either sidethe loins and running down into the flukes insensibly blend with them and largely contribute to their might so that in the tail the confluentmeasureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point could annihilation occur to matter this were the thing to do it nor does this its amazing strength at all tend to cripplethe graceful flexion of its motions where infantileness of easeundulates through a titanism of power on the contrary those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it real strength never impairs beauty or harmony but it often bestows it and in everything imposingly beautiful strength has much to do withthe magic take away the tied tendons that all over seem burstingfrom the marble in the carved hercules and its charm would be gone as devout eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpseof goethe he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man that seemed as a roman triumphal arch when angelo paints evengod the father in human form mark what robustness is there and whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the son the soft curled hermaphroditical italian pictures in whichhis idea has been most successfully embodied these pictures so destitute as they are of all brawniness hint nothing of any power but the mere negative feminine one of submission and endurance which on all hands it is conceded form the peculiar practicalvirtues of his teachings such is the subtle elasticity of the organ i treat of that whetherwielded in sport or in earnest or in anger whatever be the moodit be in its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace therein no fairy s arm can transcend it five great motions are peculiar to it first when used as afin for progression second when used as a mace in battle third in sweeping fourth in lobtailing fifth in peaking flukes first being horizontal in its position the leviathan s tail actsin a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures it never wriggles in man or fish wriggling is a sign of inferiority to the whale his tail is the sole means of propulsion scroll wise coiled forwards beneath the body and then rapidlysprung backwards it is this which gives that singular darting leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming his side fins only serve to steer by second it is a little significant that while one sperm whale onlyfights another sperm whale with his head and jaw nevertheless in hisconflicts with man he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail in striking at a boat he swiftly curves away his flukes from it and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil if it be madein the unobstructed air especially if it descend to its mark the stroke is then simply irresistible no ribs of man or boatcan withstand it your only salvation lies in eluding it but if it comes sideways through the opposing water then partlyowing to the light buoyancy of the whale boat and the elasticityof its materials a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two a sortof stitch in the side is generally the most serious result these submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery that they are accounted mere child s play some one strips offa frock and the hole is stopped third i cannot demonstrate it but it seems to me that inthe whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled bythe daintiness of the elephant s trunk this delicacy is chieflyevinced in the action of sweeping when in maidenly gentlenessthe whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukesfrom side to side upon the surface of the sea and if he feelbut a sailor s whisker woe to that sailor whiskers and all what tenderness there is in that preliminary touch had this tail any prehensile power i should straightway bethinkme of darmonodes elephant that so frequented the flower market and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels and then caressed their zones on more accounts than one a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensilevirtue in his tail for i have heard of yet another elephant that when wounded in the fight curved round his trunk andextracted the dart fourth stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied securityof the middle of solitary seas you find him unbent from the vastcorpulence of his dignity and kitten like he plays on the oceanas if it were a hearth but still you see his power in his play the broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air thensmiting the surface the thunderous concussion resounds for miles you would almost think a great gun had been discharged and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor from the spiracleat his other extremity you would think that that was the smokefrom the touch hole fifth as in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukeslies considerably below the level of his back they are then completelyout of sight beneath the surface but when he is about to plungeinto the deeps his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of hisbody are tossed erect in the air and so remain vibrating a moment till they downwards shoot out of view excepting the sublime breach somewhere else to be described this peaking of the whale s flukesis perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodicallysnatching at the highest heaven so in dreams have i seen majesticsatan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from

my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea i once sawa large herd of whales in the east all heading towards the sun and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes as it seemedto me at the time such a grand embodiment of adoration of the godswas never beheld even in persia the home of the fire worshippers as ptolemy philopater testified of the african elephant i thentestified of the whale pronouncing him the most devout of all beings for according to king juba the military elephants of antiquity oftenhailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence the chance comparison in this chapter between the whale and the elephant so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the otherare concerned should not tend to place those two opposite organs onan equality much less the creatures to which they respectively belong for as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to leviathan so compared with leviathan s tail his trunk is but the stalk of a lily the most direful blow from the elephant s trunk were as the playful tapof a fan compared with the measureless crush and crash of the spermwhale s ponderous flukes which in repeated instances have one afterthe other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air very much as an indian juggler tosses his balls though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whaleand the elephant is preposterous inasmuch as in that particularthe elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale thata dog does to the elephant nevertheless there are not wantingsome points of curious similitude among these is the spout it is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dustin his trunk and then elevating it jet it forth in a stream the more i consider this mighty tail the more do i deplore my inabilityto express it at times there are gestures in it which though theywould well grace the hand of man remain wholly inexplicable in an extensive herd so remarkable occasionally are thesemystic gestures that i have heard hunters who have declared them akinto free mason signs and symbols that the whale indeed by thesemethods intelligently conversed with the world nor are there wantingother motions of the whale in his general body full of strangeness and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant dissect himhow i may then i but go skin deep i know him not and never will but if i know not even the tail of this whale how understand hishead much more how comprehend his face when face he has none thou shalt see my back parts my tail he seems to say but my faceshall not be seen but i cannot completely make out his back parts and hint what he will about his face i say again he has no face chapter the grand armadathe long and narrow peninsula of malacca extending south eastwardfrom the territories of birmah forms the most southerly point ofall asia in a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the longislands of sumatra java bally and timor which with many others form a vast mole or rampart lengthwise connecting asia with australia and dividing the long unbroken indian ocean from the thickly studdedoriental archipelagoes this rampart is pierced by several sally portsfor the convenience of ships and whales conspicuous among which arethe straits of sunda and malacca by the straits of sunda chiefly vessels bound to china from the west emerge into the china seas those narrow straits of sunda divide sumatra from java and standingmidway in that vast rampart of islands buttressed by that boldgreen promontory known to seamen as java head they not a littlecorrespond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices and silks and jewels and gold and ivory with which the thousand islandsof that oriental sea are enriched it seems a significant provisionof nature that such treasures by the very formation of the land should at least bear the appearance however ineffectual of being guarded from the all grasping western world the shoresof the straits of sunda are unsupplied with those domineeringfortresses which guard the entrances to the mediterranean the baltic and the propontis unlike the danes these orientals do not demandthe obsequious homage of lowered top sails from the endlessprocession of ships before the wind which for centuries past by night and by day have passed between the islands of sumatraand java freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east but while they freely waive a ceremonial like this they do by nomeans renounce their claim to more solid tribute time out of mind the piratical proas of the malays lurking among the low shaded coves and islets of sumatra have sallied out upon the vessels sailing through the straits fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spears though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have receivedat the hands of european cruisers the audacity of these corsairshas of late been somewhat repressed yet even at the present day we occasionally hear of english and american vessels which in those waters have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged with a fair fresh wind the pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits ahab purposing to pass through them into the java sea and thence cruising northwards over waters known to be frequented here and thereby the sperm whale sweep inshore by the philippine islands and gainthe far coast of japan in time for the great whaling season there by these means the circumnavigating pequod would sweep almost all theknown sperm whale cruising grounds of the world previous to descendingupon the line in the pacific where ahab though everywhere elsefoiled in his pursuit firmly counted upon giving battle to moby dick in the sea he was most known to frequent and at a season when he mightmost reasonably be presumed to be haunting it but how now in this zoned quest does ahab touch no land doeshis crew drink air surely he will stop for water nay for along time now the circus running sun has raced within hisfiery ring and needs no sustenance but what s in himself so ahab mark this too in the whaler while otherhulls are loaded down with alien stuff to be transferredto foreign wharves the world wandering whale ship carriesno cargo but herself and crew their weapons and their wants she has a whole lake s contents bottled in her ample hold she is ballasted with utilities not altogether with unusablepig lead and kentledge she carries years water in her clear old prime nantucket water which when three years afloat the nantucketer in the pacific prefers to drink beforethe brackish fluid but yesterday rafted off in casks from the peruvian or indian streams hence it is that while other ships may have gone to china from new york and back again touching at a score of ports the whale ship in all that interval may not have sighted one grain of soil her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves so that did you carry them the news that another flood had come they would only answer well boys here s the ark now as many sperm whales had been captured off the westerncoast of java in the near vicinity of the straits of sunda indeed as most of the ground roundabout was generallyrecognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising therefore as the pequod gained more and more upon java head the look outs were repeatedly hailed and admonished to keep wide awake but though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed onthe starboard bow and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamonwas snuffed in the air yet not a single jet was descried almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts the ship had well nigh entered the straits when the customarycheering cry was heard from aloft and ere long a spectacleof singular magnificence saluted us but here be it premised that owing to the unwearied activitywith which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans the sperm whales instead of almost invariably sailing in smalldetached companies as in former times are now frequently metwith in extensive herds sometimes embracing so great a multitude that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had swornsolemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection to this aggregation of the sperm whale into such immense caravans may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together without being greeted by a single spout and then be suddenlysaluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands broad on both bows at the distance of some two or three miles and forming a great semicircle embracing one half of the level horizon a continuous chain of whale jets were up playing and sparklingin the noon day air unlike the straight perpendicular twin jetsof the right whale which dividing at top falls over in two branches like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow the single forward slantingspout of the sperm whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist continually rising and falling away to leeward seen from the pequod s deck then as she would rise on a high hillof the sea this host of vapory spouts individually curling up intothe air and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis descried of a balmy autumnal morning by some horseman on a height as marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains accelerate their march all eagerness to place that perilous passage intheir rear and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward throughthe straits gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle and swimming on in one solid but still crescentic centre crowding all sail the pequod pressed after them the harpooneershandling their weapons and loudly cheering from the headsof their yet suspended boats if the wind only held little doubt had they that chased through these straitsof sunda the vast host would only deploy into the orientalseas to witness the capture of not a few of their number and who could tell whether in that congregated caravan moby dick himself might not temporarily be swimming like the worshipped white elephant in the coronation processionof the siamese so with stun sail piled on stun sail wesailed along driving these leviathans before us when of a sudden the voice of tashtego was heard loudly directing attentionto something in our wake corresponding to the crescent in our van we beheld another in our rear it seemed formed of detached white vapors rising and falling somethinglike the spouts of the whales only they did not so completely comeand go for they constantly hovered without finally disappearing levelling his glass at this sight ahab quickly revolved in hispivot hole crying aloft there and rig whips and buckets to wetthe sails malays sir and after us as if too long lurking behind the headlands till the pequodshould fairly have entered the straits these rascally asiaticswere now in hot pursuit to make up for their over cautious delay but when the swift pequod with a fresh leading wind was herselfin hot chase how very kind of these tawny philanthropiststo assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit mere riding whips and rowels to her that they were as with glass under arm ahab to and fro paced the deck in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him some such fancy as the above seemed his and when he glancedupon the green walls of the watery defile in which the shipwas then sailing and bethought him that through that gate laythe route to his vengeance and beheld how that through that samegate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end and not only that but a herd of remorseless wild piratesand inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering himon with their curses when all these conceits had passedthrough his brain ahab s brow was left gaunt and ribbed like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it without being able to drag the firm thing from its place but thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew and when after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern the pequodat last shot by the vivid green cockatoo point on the sumatra side emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond then the harpooneersseemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining uponthe ship than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gainedupon the malays but still driving on in the wake of the whales at length they seemed abating their speed gradually the ship neared them and the wind now dying away word was passed to spring to the boats but no sooner did the herd by some presumed wonderful instinct of thesperm whale become notified of the three keels that were after them though as yet a mile in their rear than they rallied again and formingin close ranks and battalions so that their spouts all looked likeflashing lines of stacked bayonets moved on with redoubled velocity stripped to our shirts and drawers we sprang to the white ash and after several hours pulling were almost disposed to renouncethe chase when a general pausing commotion among the whales gaveanimating tokens that they were now at last under the influenceof that strange perplexity of inert irresolution which when thefishermen perceive it in the whale they say he is gallied thecompact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidlyand steadily swimming were now broken up in one measureless rout and like king porus elephants in the indian battle with alexander they seemed going mad with consternation in all directionsexpanding in vast irregular circles and aimlessly swimming hitherand thither by their short thick spoutings they plainly betrayedtheir distraction of panic this was still more strangely evincedby those of their number who completely paralysed as it were helplessly floated like water logged dismantled ships on the sea had these leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves they could notpossibly have evinced such excessive dismay but this occasionaltimidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures though banding together in tens of thousands the lion manedbuffaloes of the west have fled before a solitary horseman witness too all human beings how when herded together in the sheepfoldof a theatre s pit they will at the slightest alarm of fire rush helter skelter for the outlets crowding trampling jamming and remorselessly dashing each other to death best therefore withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is notinfinitely outdone by the madness of men to gally or gallow is to frighten excessively to confound with fright it is an old saxon word it occurs once in shakespeare the wrathful skies gallow the very wanderers of the dark and makethem keep their caves to common language the word is now completely obsolete when the polite landsman first hears it from the gaunt nantucketer he isapt to set it down as one of the whaleman s self derived savageries much the same is it with many other sinewy saxonisms of this sort which emigrated to new england rocks with the noble brawn of the oldenglish emigrants in the time of the commonwealth thus some ofthe best and furthest descended english words the etymological howardsand percys are now democratised nay plebeianised so to speak in the new world though many of the whales as has been said were in violent motion yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neitheradvanced nor retreated but collectively remained in one place as is customary in those cases the boats at once separated each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal in about three minutes time queequeg s harpoon was flung the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces and thenrunning away with us like light steered straight for the heartof the herd though such a movement on the part of the whalestruck under such circumstances is in no wise unprecedented and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated yet does itpresent one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery for as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into thefrantic shoal you bid adieu to circumspect life and only existin a delirious throb as blind and deaf the whale plunged forward as if by sheer powerof speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him as we thus tore a white gash in the sea on all sides menacedas we flew by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice isles in a tempest and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed but not a bit daunted queequeg steered us manfully now sheeringoff from this monster directly across our route in advance now edging away from that whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead while all the time starbuck stood up in the bows lance in hand pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts for there was no time to make long ones nor were the oarsmenquite idle though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with they chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business out of the way commodore cried one to a great dromedary that ofa sudden rose bodily to the surface and for an instant threatenedto swamp us hard down with your tail there cried a secondto another which close to our gunwale seemed calmly coolinghimself with his own fan like extremity all whale boats carry certain curious contrivances originally invented by the nantucket indians called druggs two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutlyclenched together so that they cross each other s grain atright angles a line of considerable length is then attachedto the middle of this block and the other end of the linebeing looped it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon it is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used for then more whales are close round you than you canpossibly chase at one time but sperm whales are not everyday encountered while you may then you must kill all you can and if you cannot kill them all at once you must wing them so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure hence it is that at times like these the drug comes into requisition our boat was furnished with three of them the first and second weresuccessfully darted and we saw the whales staggeringly running off fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg they were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball but upon flinging the third in the act of tossing overboardthe clumsy wooden block it caught under one of the seats of the boat and in an instant tore it out and carried it away dropping theoarsman in the boat s bottom as the seat slid from under him on both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks but westuffed two or three drawers and shirts in and so stoppedthe leaks for the time it had been next to impossible to dart these drugged harpoons were it not that as we advanced into the herd our whale s waygreatly diminished moreover that as we went still furtherand further from the circumference of commotion the direfuldisorders seemed waning so that when at last the jerkingharpoon drew out and the towing whale sideways vanished then with the tapering force of his parting momentum we glidedbetween two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal as iffrom some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales were heard but not felt in this central expanse the seapresented that smooth satin like surface called a sleek produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whalein his more quiet moods yes we were now in that enchantedcalm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion and still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults ofthe outer concentric circles and saw successive pods of whales eight or ten in each swiftly going round and round like multipliedspans of horses in a ring and so closely shoulder to shoulder that a titanic circus rider might easily have over archedthe middle ones and so have gone round on their backs owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us we must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up keeping at the centre of the lake we were occasionallyvisited by small tame cows and calves the women and childrenof this routed host now inclusive of the occasional wide intervals betweenthe revolving outer circles and inclusive of the spacesbetween the various pods in any one of those circles the entire area at this juncture embraced by the whole multitude must have contained at least two or three square miles at any rate though indeed such a test at such a time mightbe deceptive spoutings might be discovered from our low boatthat seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon i mention this circumstance because as if the cows andcalves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented themfrom learning the precise cause of its stopping or possibly being so young unsophisticated and every way innocentand inexperienced however it may have been these smaller whales now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence or else a stillbecharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at like household dogs they came snuffling round us right up to our gunwales and touching them till it almostseemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them queequeg patted their foreheads starbuck scratched their backswith his lance but fearful of the consequences for the timerefrained from darting it but far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface another andstill stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side for suspended in those watery vaults floated the formsof the nursing mothers of the whales and those that by theirenormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers the lake as ihave hinted was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent and as human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gazeaway from the breast as if leading two different lives at the time and while yet drawing mortal nourishment be still spirituallyfeasting upon some unearthly reminiscence even so did the youngof these whales seem looking up towards us but not at us as if we were but a bit of gulfweed in their new born sight floating on their sides the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us one of these little infants that from certain queer tokens seemedhardly a day old might have measured some fourteen feet in length and some six feet in girth he was a little frisky though as yethis body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position ithad so lately occupied in the maternal reticule where tail to head and all ready for the final spring the unborn whale lies bent like atartar s bow the delicate side fins and the palms of his flukes still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby sears newly arrived from foreign parts line line cried queequeg looking over the gunwale him fast him fast who line him who struck two whale one big one little what ails ye man cried starbuck look e here said queequeg pointing down as when the stricken whale that from the tub has reeledout hundreds of fathoms of rope as after deep sounding he floats up again and shows the slackened curling linebuoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air so now starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of madame leviathan by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase this natural line with the maternal end loose becomes entangled with the hempen one so that the cub is thereby trapped some of the subtlest secretsof the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond we saw young leviathan amours in the deep the sperm whale as with all other species of the leviathan but unlike most other fish breeds indifferently at all seasons after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months producing but one at a time though in some few known instancesgiving birth to an esau and jacob a contingency provided forin suckling by two teats curiously situated one on each sideof the anus but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that when by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut bythe hunter s lance the mother s pouring milk and blood rivallinglydiscolor the sea for rods the milk is very sweet and rich it has been tasted by man it might do well with strawberries when overflowing with mutual esteem the whales salute more hominum and thus though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternationsand affrights did these inscrutable creatures at the centrefreely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments yea serenely revelled in dalliance and delight but even so amid the tornadoed atlantic of my being do i myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me deep down and deep inland there i still bathe me in eternalmildness of joy meanwhile as we thus lay entranced the occasional sudden franticspectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them but the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly dartingto and fro across the circles was nothing to what at last met our eyes it is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonlypowerful and alert to seek to hamstring him as it were by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail tendon it is done bydarting a short handled cutting spade to which is attached a ropefor hauling it back again a whale wounded as we afterwards learned in this part but not effectually as it seemed had broken awayfrom the boat carrying along with him half of the harpoon line and in the extraordinary agony of the wound he was now dashingamong the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado arnold at the battle of saratoga carrying dismay wherever he went but agonizing as was the wound of this whale and an appallingspectacle enough any way yet the peculiar horror with whichhe seemed to inspire the rest of the herd was owing to a causewhich at first the intervening distance obscured from us but at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidentsof the fishery this whale had become entangled in the harpoon linethat he towed he had also run away with the cutting spade in him and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon line roundhis tail the cutting spade itself had worked loose from his flesh so that tormented to madness he was now churning through the water violently flailing with his flexible tail and tossing the keenspade about him wounding and murdering his own comrades this terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from theirstationary fright first the whales forming the margin of our lakebegan to crowd a little and tumble against each other as if liftedby half spent billows from afar then the lake itself began faintlyto heave and swell the submarine bridal chambers and nurseries vanished in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central circlesbegan to swim in thickening clusters yes the long calm was departing a low advancing hum was soon heard and then like to the tumultuousmasses of block ice when the great river hudson breaks up in spring the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain instantly starbuckand queequeg changed places starbuck taking the stern oars oars he intensely whispered seizing the helm gripeyour oars and clutch your souls now my god men stand by shove him off you queequeg the whale there prick him hit him stand up stand up and stay so spring men pull men never mindtheir backs scrape them scrape away the boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks leaving a narrow dardanelles between their long lengths but by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening then giving way rapidly and at the same time earnestly watchingfor another outlet after many similar hair breadth escapes we atlast swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles but now crossed by random whales all violently making for one centre this lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of queequeg shat who while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales had his hat taken clean from his head by the air eddy made by the suddentossing of a pair of broad flukes close by riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement for having clumped together at last in one dense body they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness further pursuit was useless but the boats still lingered in theirwake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern and likewise to secure one which flask had killed and waited the waif is a pennoned pole two or three of which are carriedby every boat and which when additional game is at hand are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale both to mark its place on the sea and also as token ofprior possession should the boats of any other ship draw near the result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of thatsagacious saying in the fishery the more whales the less fish of all the drugged whales only one was captured the rest contrived to escape for the time but only to be taken as will hereafter be seen by some other craft than the pequod chapter schools and schoolmastersthe previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herdof sperm whales and there was also then given the probablecause inducing those vast aggregations now though such great bodies are at times encountered yet as musthave been seen even at the present day small detached bands areoccasionally observed embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each such bands are known as schools they generally are of two sorts those composed almost entirely of females and those mustering nonebut young vigorous males or bulls as they are familiarly designated in cavalier attendance upon the school of females you invariably seea male of full grown magnitude but not old who upon any alarm evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flightof his ladies in truth this gentleman is a luxurious ottoman swimming about over the watery world surroundingly accompanied by allthe solaces and endearments of the harem the contrast between thisottoman and his concubines is striking because while he is alwaysof the largest leviathanic proportions the ladies even at full growth are not more than one third of the bulk of an average sized male they are comparatively delicate indeed i dare say not to exceed halfa dozen yards round the waist nevertheless it cannot be denied that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to en bon point it is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in theirindolent ramblings like fashionables they are for everon the move in leisurely search of variety you meet themon the line in time for the full flower of the equatorialfeeding season having just returned perhaps from spendingthe summer in the northern seas and so cheating summer of allunpleasant weariness and warmth by the time they have loungedup and down the promenade of the equator awhile they startfor the oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year when serenely advancing on one of these journeys if any strangesuspicious sights are seen my lord whale keeps a wary eye on hisinteresting family should any unwarrantably pert young leviathan comingthat way presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies with what prodigious fury the bashaw assails him and chases him away high times indeed if unprincipled young rakes like himare to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss though do what the bashaw will he cannot keep the most notoriouslothario out of his bed for alas all fish bed in common as ashore the ladies often cause the most terrible duels amongtheir rival admirers just so with the whales who sometimes cometo deadly battle and all for love they fence with their longlower jaws sometimes locking them together and so striving forthe supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters furrowed heads broken teeth scolloped fins and in some instances wrenched and dislocated mouths but supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself awayat the first rush of the harem s lord then is it very divertingto watch that lord gently he insinuates his vast bulk amongthem again and revels there awhile still in tantalizing vicinityto young lothario like pious solomon devoutly worshipping amonghis thousand concubines granting other whales to be in sight the fisherman will seldom give chase to one of these grand turks for these grand turks are too lavish of their strength and hence their unctuousness is small as for the sons andthe daughters they beget why those sons and daughters musttake care of themselves at least with only the maternal help for like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named my lord whale has no taste for the nursery however muchfor the bower and so being a great traveller he leaves hisanonymous babies all over the world every baby an exotic in good time nevertheless as the ardor of youth declines as years and dumps increase as reflection lends her solemn pauses in short as a general lassitude overtakes the sated turk then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens our ottoman enters upon the impotent repentant admonitory stageof life forswears disbands the harem and grown to an exemplary sulky old soul goes about all alone among the meridians andparallels saying his prayers and warning each young leviathanfrom his amorous errors now as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school so isthe lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster it is therefore not in strict character however admirably satirical that after going to school himself he should then go abroadinculcating not what he learned there but the folly of it his title schoolmaster would very naturally seem derived fromthe name bestowed upon the harem itself but some have surmisedthat the man who first thus entitled this sort of ottoman whale must have read the memoirs of vidocq and informed himself what sortof a country schoolmaster that famous frenchman was in his younger days and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated intosome of his pupils the same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmasterwhale betakes himself in his advancing years is trueof all aged sperm whales almost universally a lone whale as a solitary leviathan is called proves an ancient one like venerable moss bearded daniel boone he will have noone near him but nature herself and her he takes to wifein the wilderness of waters and the best of wives she is though she keeps so many moody secrets the schools composing none but young and vigorous males previously mentioned offer a strong contrast to the harem schools for while those female whales are characteristically timid the young males or forty barrel bulls as they call them are by far the most pugnacious of all leviathans and proverbiallythe most dangerous to encounter excepting those wondrousgrey headed grizzled whales sometimes met and these will fightyou like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout the forty barrel bull schools are larger than the harem schools like a mob of young collegians they are full of fight fun and wickedness tumbling round the world at such a reckless rollicking rate that no prudent underwriter would insure themany more than he would a riotous lad at yale or harvard they soonrelinquish this turbulence though and when about three fourths grown break up and separately go about in quest of settlements that is harems another point of difference between the male and female schoolsis still more characteristic of the sexes say you strikea forty barrel bull poor devil all his comrades quit him but strike a member of the harem school and her companions swimaround her with every token of concern sometimes lingeringso near her and so long as themselves to fall a prey chapter fast fish and loose fishthe allusion to the waifs and waif poles in the last chapterbut one necessitates some account of the laws and regulationsof the whale fishery of which the waif may be deemed the grandsymbol and badge it frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company a whale may be struck by one vessel then escape and be finally killedand captured by another vessel and herein are indirectly comprisedmany minor contingencies all partaking of this one grand feature for example after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm and drifting far away to leeward be retaken by a second whaler who in a calm snugly tows it alongside without risk of life or line thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise betweenthe fishermen were there not some written or unwritten universal undisputed law applicable to all cases perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment was that of holland it was decreed by the states general in a d but though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law yet the american fishermen have been their own legislatorsand lawyers in this matter they have provided a system whichfor terse comprehensiveness surpasses justinian s pandects andthe by laws of the chinese society for the suppression of meddlingwith other people s business yes these laws might be engravenon a queen anne s farthing or the barb of a harpoon and wornround the neck so small are they i a fast fish belongs to the party fast to it ii a loose fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it but what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirablebrevity of it which necessitates a vast volume of commentariesto expound it first what is a fast fish alive or dead a fish is technically fast when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat by any mediumat all controllable by the occupant or occupants a mast an oar a nine inch cable a telegraph wire or a strand of cobweb it is allthe same likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif or any other recognized symbol of possession so long as the partywailing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside as well as their intention so to do these are scientific commentaries but the commentaries of the whalementhemselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks the coke upon littleton of the fist true among the more uprightand honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claimpossession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party but others are by no means so scrupulous some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale troverlitigated in england wherein the plaintiffs set forththat after a hard chase of a whale in the northern seas and when indeed they the plaintiffs had succeeded in harpooningthe fish they were at last through peril of their lives obliged to forsake not only their lines but their boat itself ultimately the defendants the crew of another ship came up with the whale struck killed seized and finallyappropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs and when those defendants were remonstrated with their captainsnapped his fingers in the plaintiffs teeth and assuredthem that by way of doxology to the deed he had done he would now retain their line harpoons and boat which hadremained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the valueof their whale line harpoons and boat mr erskine was counsel for the defendants lord ellenboroughwas the judge in the course of the defence the wittyerskine went on to illustrate his position by alluding to arecent crim con case wherein a gentleman after in vaintrying to bridle his wife s viciousness had at last abandonedher upon the seas of life but in the course of years repenting ofthat step he instituted an action to recover possession of her erskine was on the other side and he then supported it by saying that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady and had once had her fast and only by reason of the greatstress of her plunging viciousness had at last abandoned her yet abandon her he did so that she became a loose fish and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re harpooned her the lady then became that subsequent gentleman s property along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her now in the present case erskine contended that the examples of the whaleand the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other these pleadings and the counter pleadings being duly heard the very learned judge in set terms decided to wit that as for the boat he awarded it to the plaintiffs because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives but that with regard to the controverted whale harpoons and line they belonged to the defendants the whale because it was a loose fish at the time of the final capture and the harpoons and line because when the fish made offwith them it the fish acquired a property in those articles and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them now the defendants afterwards took the fish ergo the aforesaidarticles were theirs a common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge might possibly object to it but ploughed up to the primary rockof the matter the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted and applied and elucidatedby lord ellenborough in the above cited case these two lawstouching fast fish and loose fish i say will on reflection be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture the temple of the law like the temple of the philistines has but two props to stand on is it not a saying in every one s mouth possession is half of the law that is regardless of how the thing came into possession but often possession is the whole of the law what are the sinewsand souls of russian serfs and republican slaves but fast fish whereof possession is the whole of the law what to the rapaciouslandlord is the widow s last mite but a fast fish what is yonderundetected villain s marble mansion with a doorplate for a waif what is that but a fast fish what is the ruinous discountwhich mordecai the broker gets from the poor woebegone the bankrupt on a loan to keep woebegone s family from starvation what is that ruinous discount but a fast fish what is the archbishopof savesoul s income of pounds seized from the scant breadand cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken backed laborers all sure of heaven without any of savesoul s help what is that globular but a fast fish what are the duke of dunder s hereditary townsand hamlets but fast fish what to that redoubted harpooneer john bull is poor ireland but a fast fish what to that apostolic lancer brother jonathan is texas but a fast fish and concerning all these is not possession the whole of the law but if the doctrine of fast fish be pretty generally applicable the kindred doctrine of loose fish is still more widely so that is internationally and universally applicable what was america in but a loose fish in which columbusstruck the spanish standard by way of wailing it for his royalmaster and mistress what was poland to the czar what greeceto the turk what india to england what at last will mexicobe to the united states all loose fish what are the rights of man and the liberties of the world butloose fish what all men s minds and opinions but loose fish whatis the principle of religious belief in them but a loose fish whatto the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkersbut loose fish what is the great globe itself but a loose fish andwhat are you reader but a loose fish and a fast fish too chapter heads or tails de balena vero sufficit si rex habeat caput et regina caudam bracton l c latin from the books of the laws of england which taken along withthe context means that of all whales captured by anybody on the coastof that land the king as honorary grand harpooneer must havethe head and the queen be respectfully presented with the tail a division which in the whale is much like halving an apple there isno intermediate remainder now as this law under a modified form is to this day in force in england and as it offers in various respectsa strange anomaly touching the general law of fast and loose fish it is here treated of in a separate chapter on the same courteousprinciple that prompts the english railways to be at the expense of aseparate car specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty in the first place in curious proof of the fact that the above mentionedlaw is still in force i proceed to lay before you a circumstance thathappened within the last two years it seems that some honest mariners of dover or sandwich or some one of the cinque ports had after a hard chase succeededin killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originallydescried afar off from the shore now the cinque ports arepartially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policemanor beadle called a lord warden holding the office directlyfrom the crown i believe all the royal emoluments incidentto the cinque port territories become by assignment his by some writers this office is called a sinecure but not so because the lord warden is busily employed at times in fobbinghis perquisites which are his chiefly by virtue of that samefobbing of them now when these poor sun burnt mariners bare footed and with theirtrowsers rolled high up on their eely legs had wearily hauledtheir fat fish high and dry promising themselves a good poundsfrom the precious oil and bone and in fantasy sipping rare teawith their wives and good ale with their cronies upon the strengthof their respective shares up steps a very learned and most christianand charitable gentleman with a copy of blackstone under his arm and laying it upon the whale s head he says hands off this fish my masters is a fast fish i seize it as the lord warden s upon thisthe poor mariners in their respectful consternation so truly english knowing not what to say fall to vigorously scratching their headsall round meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger but that did in nowise mend the matter or at all soften the hard heartof the learned gentleman with the copy of blackstone at length oneof them after long scratching about for his ideas made bold to speak please sir who is the lord warden the duke but the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish it is his we have been at great trouble and peril and some expense and is all that to go to the duke s benefit we getting nothingat all for our pains but our blisters it is his is the duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate modeof getting a livelihood it is his i thought to relieve my old bed ridden mother by part of my shareof this whale it is his won t the duke be content with a quarter or a half it is his in a word the whale was seized and sold and his grace the duke ofwellington received the money thinking that viewed in some particularlights the case might by a bare possibility in some small degreebe deemed under the circumstances a rather hard one an honest clergymanof the town respectfully addressed a note to his grace begging himto take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration to which my lord duke in substance replied both letters were published that he had already done so and received the money and would be obligedto the reverend gentleman if for the future he the reverend gentleman would decline meddling with other people s business is this the stillmilitant old man standing at the corners of the three kingdoms on all hands coercing alms of beggars it will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the duketo the whale was a delegated one from the sovereign we must needsinquire then on what principle the sovereign is originally investedwith that right the law itself has already been set forth but plowdon gives us the reason for it says plowdon the whale so caughtbelongs to the king and queen because of its superior excellence and by the soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogentargument in such matters but why should the king have the head and the queen the tail a reason for that ye lawyers in his treatise on queen gold or queen pin money an oldking s bench author one william prynne thus discourseth ye tail is ye queen s that ye queen s wardrobe may be suppliedwith ye whalebone now this was written at a time when the blacklimber bone of the greenland or right whale was largely usedin ladies bodices but this same bone is not in the tail it is in the head which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyerlike prynne but is the queen a mermaid to be presented with a tail an allegorical meaning may lurk here there are two royal fish so styled by the english law writers the whale and the sturgeon both royal property under certain limitations and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown s ordinary revenue i know not that any other author has hinted of the matter but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be dividedin the same way as the whale the king receiving the highly denseand elastic head peculiar to that fish which symbolically regarded may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality and thus there seems a reason in all things even in law chapter the pequod meets the rose bud in vain it was to rake for ambergriese in the paunchof this leviathan insufferable fetor denying not inquiry sir t browne v e it was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy vapory mid day sea that the many noses on the pequod s deck provedmore vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft a peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea i will bet something now said stubb that somewhere hereaboutsare some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day i thought they would keel up before long presently the vapors in advance slid aside and there in the distancelay a ship whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale mustbe alongside as we glided nearer the stranger showed french colorsfrom his peak and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea fowl that circled and hovered and swooped around him it was plain that the whale alongsidemust be what the fishermen call a blasted whale that is a whale that hasdied unmolested on the sea and so floated an unappropriated corpse it may well be conceived what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale worse than an assyrian city in the plague when the living are incompetentto bury the departed so intolerable indeed is it regarded by some that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it yet are there those who will still do it notwithstanding the factthat the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality and by no means of the nature of attar of rose coming still nearer with the expiring breeze we sawthat the frenchman had a second whale alongside and thissecond whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first in truth it turned out to be one of those problematical whalesthat seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leaving their defunct bodies almost entirelybankrupt of anything like oil nevertheless in the properplace we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turnup his nose at such a whale as this however much he may shunblasted whales in general the pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that stubbvowed he recognized his cutting spade pole entangled in the linesthat were knotted round the tail of one of these whales there s a pretty fellow now he banteringly laughed standing in the ship s bows there s a jackal for ye i well know that these crappoes of frenchmen are but poor devilsin the fishery sometimes lowering their boats for breakers mistaking them for sperm whale spouts yes and sometimes sailingfrom their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles and cases of snuffers foreseeing that all the oil they will get won tbe enough to dip the captain s wick into aye we all know these things but look ye here s a crappo that is content with our leavings the drugged whale there i mean aye and is content too withscraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there poor devil i say pass round a hat some one and let smake him a present of a little oil for dear charity s sake for what oil he ll get from that drugged whale there wouldn t be fit to burn in a jail no not in a condemned cell and as for the other whale why i ll agree to get more oil bychopping up and trying out these three masts of ours than he llget from that bundle of bones though now that i think of it it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil yes ambergris i wonder now if our old man has thought of that it s worth trying yes i m for it and so saying he startedfor the quarter deck by this time the faint air had become a complete calm so thatwhether or no the pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again issuing from the cabin stubb now called his boat s crew and pulled off for the stranger drawing across her bow he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful french taste the upper part of her stem piece was carved in the likenessof a huge drooping stalk was painted green and for thornshad copper spikes projecting from it here and there the wholeterminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red color upon her head boards in large gilt letters he read boutonde rose rose button or rose bud and this was the romanticname of this aromatic ship though stubb did not understand the bouton part of the inscription yet the word rose and the bulbous figure head put together sufficiently explained the whole to him a wooden rose bud eh he cried with his hand to his nose that will do very well but how like all creation it smells now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side and thus comeclose to the blasted whale and so talk over it arrived then at this spot with one hand still to his nose he bawled bouton de rose ahoy are there any of youbouton de roses that speak english yes rejoined a guernsey man from the bulwarks who turnedout to be the chief mate well then my bouton de rose bud have you seen the white whale what whale the white whale a sperm whale moby dick have ye seen him never heard of such a whale cachalot blanche white whale no very good then good bye now and i ll call again in a minute then rapidly pulling back towards the pequod and seeing ahab leaningover the quarter deck rail awaiting his report he moulded his two handsinto a trumpet and shouted no sir no upon which ahab retired and stubb returned to the frenchman he now perceived that the guernsey man who had just got into the chains and was using a cutting spade had slung his nose in a sort of bag what s the matter with your nose there said stubb broke it i wish it was broken or that i didn t have any nose at all answered the guernsey man who did not seem to relish the jobhe was at very much but what are you holding yours for oh nothing it s a wax nose i have to hold it on fine day ain t it air rather gardenny i should say throw us a bunch of posies will ye bouton de rose what in the devil s name do you want here roared the guernseyman flying into a sudden passion oh keep cool cool yes that s the word why don t youpack those whales in ice while you re working at em but joking aside though do you know rose bud that it sall nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales as for that dried up one there he hasn t a gill inhis whole carcase i know that well enough but d ye see the captain here won t believeit this is his first voyage he was a cologne manufacturer before but come aboard and mayhap he ll believe you if he won t me and so i ll get out of this dirty scrape anything to oblige ye my sweet and pleasant fellow rejoined stubb and with that he soon mounted to the deck there a queer scene presented itself the sailors in tasselled caps of red worsted were getting the heavy tacklesin readiness for the whales but they worked rather slowand talked very fast and seemed in anything but a good humor all their noses upwardly projected from their faces likeso many jibbooms now and then pairs of them would droptheir work and run up to the mast head to get some fresh air some thinking they would catch the plague dipped oakumin coal tar and at intervals held it to their nostrils others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short offat the bowl were vigorously puffing tobacco smoke so that itconstantly filled their olfactories stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceedingfrom the captain s round house abaft and looking in that directionsaw a fiery face thrust from behind the door which was held ajarfrom within this was the tormented surgeon who after in vainremonstrating against the proceedings of the day had betakenhimself to the captain s round house cabinet he called it to avoid the pest but still could not help yelling out hisentreaties and indignations at times marking all this stubb argued well for his scheme and turning tothe guernsey man had a little chat with him during which the strangermate expressed his detestation of his captain as a conceited ignoramus who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle sounding him carefully stubb further perceived that the guernsey manhad not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris he therefore held his peace on that head but otherwise was quitefrank and confidential with him so that the two quickly concocteda little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the captain without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity according to this little plan of theirs the guernsey man under coverof an interpreter s office was to tell the captain what he pleased but as coming from stubb and as for stubb he was to utter any nonsensethat should come uppermost in him during the interview by this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin he was a small and dark but rather delicate looking manfor a sea captain with large whiskers and moustache however and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch seals at his side to this gentleman stubb was now politely introduced bythe guernsey man who at once ostentatiously put on the aspectof interpreting between them what shall i say to him first said he why said stubb eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyishto me though i don t pretend to be a judge he says monsieur said the guernsey man in french turning to his captain that only yesterday his ship spokea vessel whose captain and chief mate with six sailors had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale theyhad brought alongside upon this the captain started and eagerly desired to know more what now said the guernsey man to stubb why since he takes it so easy tell him that now ihave eyed him carefully i m quite certain that he s nomore fit to command a whale ship than a st jago monkey in fact tell him from me he s a baboon he vows and declares monsieur that the other whale the dried one is far more deadly than the blasted one in fine monsieur he conjures us as we value our lives to cut loose from these fish instantly the captain ran forward and in a loud voice commandedhis crew to desist from hoisting the cutting tackles and at oncecast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship what now said the guernsey man when the captain had returned to them why let me see yes you may as well tell him now that that in fact tell him i ve diddled him and aside to himself perhaps somebody else he says monsieur that he s very happy to have been of anyservice to us hearing this the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties meaning himself and mate and concluded by inviting stubb down intohis cabin to drink a bottle of bordeaux he wants you to take a glass of wine with him said the interpreter thank him heartily but tell him it s against my principles to drinkwith the man i ve diddled in fact tell him i must go he says monsieur that his principles won t admit of his drinking but that if monsieur wants to live another day to drink then monsieurhad best drop all four boats and pull the ship away from these whales for it s so calm they won t drift by this time stubb was over the side and getting into his boat hailed the guernsey man to this effect that having a longtow line in his boat he would do what he could to help them by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship s side while the frenchman s boats then were engaged in towing the shipone way stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow line presently a breeze sprang up stubb feigned to cast off from the whale hoisting his boats the frenchman soon increased his distance while the pequod slid in between him and stubb s whale whereupon stubb quickly pulled to the floating body and hailingthe pequod to give notice of his intentions at once proceeded to reapthe fruit of his unrighteous cunning seizing his sharp boat spade he commenced an excavation in the body a little behind the side fin you would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs it waslike turning up old roman tiles and pottery buried in fat english loam his boat s crew were all in high excitement eagerly helping their chief and looking as anxious as gold hunters and all the time numberless fowls were diving and ducking and screaming and yelling and fighting around them stubb was beginning to look disappointed especially as the horriblenosegay increased when suddenly from out the very heart ofthis plague there stole a faint stream of perfume which flowedthrough the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it as one river will flow into and then along with another without at all blending with it for a time i have it i have it cried stubb with delight striking somethingin the subterranean regions a purse a purse dropping his spade he thrust both hands in and drew outhandfuls of something that looked like ripe windsor soap or rich mottled old cheese very unctuous and savory withal you might easily dent it with your thumb it is of a huebetween yellow and ash color and this good friends is ambergris worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist some six handfuls were obtained but more was unavoidably lostin the sea and still more perhaps might have been securedwere it not for impatient ahab s loud command to stubb to desist and come on board else the ship would bid them good bye chapter ambergrisnow this ambergris is a very curious substance and so important as anarticle of commerce that in a certain nantucket born captain coffinwas examined at the bar of the english house of commons on that subject for at that time and indeed until a comparatively late day the precise origin of ambergris remained like amber itself a problem to the learned though the word ambergris is but the frenchcompound for grey amber yet the two substances are quite distinct for amber though at times found on the sea coast is also dug up in somefar inland soils whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea besides amber is a hard transparent brittle odorless substance used for mouth pieces to pipes for beads and ornaments but ambergrisis soft waxy and so highly fragrant and spicy that it is largely usedin perfumery in pastiles precious candles hair powders and pomatum the turks use it in cooking and also carry it to mecca for the samepurpose that frankincense is carried to st peter s in rome some winemerchants drop a few grains into claret to flavor it who would think then that such fine ladies and gentlemen shouldregale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowelsof a sick whale yet so it is by some ambergris is supposed to bethe cause and by others the effect of the dyspepsia in the whale how to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say unless by administeringthree or four boat loads of brandreth s pills and then running outof harm s way as laborers do in blasting rocks i have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris certain hard round bony plates which at first stubb thoughtmight be sailors trousers buttons but it afterwards turnedout that they were nothing more than pieces of small squidbones embalmed in that manner now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergrisshould be found in the heart of such decay is this nothing bethink thee of that saying of st paul in corinthians about corruption and incorruption how that we are sown in dishonor but raised in glory and likewise call to mind that sayingof paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk also forget not the strange fact that of all things of ill savor cologne water in its rudimental manufacturing stages is the worst i should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal but cannot owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often madeagainst whalemen and which in the estimation of some alreadybiased minds might be considered as indirectly substantiatedby what has been said of the frenchman s two whales elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly untidy business but there is another thing to rebut they hint that all whales always smell bad now how did thisodious stigma originate i opine that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival ofthe greenland whaling ships in london more than two centuries ago because those whalemen did not then and do not now try outtheir oil at sea as the southern ships have always done but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits thrust it throughthe bung holes of large casks and carry it home in that manner the shortness of the season in those icy seas and the sudden andviolent storms to which they are exposed forbidding any other course the consequence is that upon breaking into the hold and unloadingone of these whale cemeteries in the greenland dock a savor isgiven forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an oldcity graveyard for the foundations of a lying in hospital i partly surmise also that this wicked charge againstwhalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coastof greenland in former times of a dutch village calledschmerenburgh or smeerenberg which latter name is the one usedby the learned fogo von slack in his great work on smells a text book on that subject as its name imports smeer fat berg to put up this village was founded in order to afforda place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be tried out without being taken home to holland for that purpose it was a collection of furnaces fat kettles and oil sheds and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forthno very pleasant savor but all this is quite differentfrom a south sea sperm whaler which in a voyage of fouryears perhaps after completely filling her hold with oil does not perhaps consume fifty days in the business of boiling out and in the state that it is casked the oil is nearly scentless the truth is that living or dead if but decently treated whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor nor can whalemen be recognised as the people of the middleages affected to detect a jew in the company by the nose nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant when as a general thing he enjoys such high health taking abundance of exercise always out of doors though it is true seldom in the open air i say that the motion of a sperm whale sflukes above water dispenses a perfume as when a musk scentedlady rustles her dress in a warm parlor what then shall i likenthe sperm whale to for fragrance considering his magnitude must it not be to that famous elephant with jewelled tusks and redolent with myrrh which was led out of an indian townto do honor to alexander the great chapter the castawayit was but some few days after encountering the frenchman that a mostsignificant event befell the most insignificant of the pequod s crew an event most lamentable and which ended in providing the sometimesmadly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanyingprophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own now in the whale ship it is not every one that goes in the boats some few hands are reserved called shipkeepers whose province itis to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale as a general thing these shipkeepers are as hardy fellowsas the men comprising the boats crews but if there happento be an unduly slender clumsy or timorous wight in the ship that wight is certain to be made a ship keeper it was so in the pequodwith the little negro pippin by nick name pip by abbreviation poor pip ye have heard of him before ye must remember his tambourineon that dramatic midnight so gloomy jolly in outer aspect pip and dough boy made a match like a black ponyand a white one of equal developments though of dissimilar color driven in one eccentric span but while hapless dough boy was by naturedull and torpid in his intellects pip though over tender hearted was at bottom very bright with that pleasant genial jolly brightnesspeculiar to his tribe a tribe which ever enjoy all holidaysand festivities with finer freer relish than any other race for blacks the year s calendar should show naught but three hundredand sixty five fourth of julys and new year s days nor smile so while i write that this little black was brilliant for even blackness hasits brilliancy behold yon lustrous ebony panelled in king s cabinets but pip loved life and all life s peaceable securities so thatthe panic striking business in which he had somehow unaccountablybecome entrapped had most sadly blurred his brightness though as erelong will be seen what was thus temporarily subdued in him in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustrewith which in his native tolland county in connecticut he had onceenlivened many a fiddler s frolic on the green and at melodiouseven tide with his gay ha ha had turned the round horizon intoone star belled tambourine so though in the clear air of day suspended against a blue veined neck the pure watered diamond drop willhealthful glow yet when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamondin its most impressive lustre he lays it against a gloomy ground and then lights it up not by the sun but by some unnatural gases then come out those fiery effulgences infernally superb then theevil blazing diamond once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies looks like some crown jewel stolen from the king of hell but letus to the story it came to pass that in the ambergris affair stubb s after oarsmanchanced so to sprain his hand as for a time to become quite maimed and temporarily pip was put into his place the first time stubb lowered with him pip evinced much nervousness but happily for that time escaped close contact with the whale and therefore came off not altogether discreditably though stubbobserving him took care afterwards to exhort him to cherish hiscourageousness to the utmost for he might often find it needful now upon the second lowering the boat paddled upon the whale and as the fish received the darted iron it gave its customary rap which happened in this instance to be right under poor pip s seat the involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap paddle in hand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slackwhale line coming against his chest he breasted it overboard with him so as to become entangled in it when at last plumping into the water that instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run the lineswiftly straightened and presto poor pip came all foaming upto the chocks of the boat remorselessly dragged there by the line which had taken several turns around his chest and neck tashtego stood in the bows he was full of the fire of the hunt he hated pip for a poltroon snatching the boat knife from its sheath he suspended its sharp edge over the line and turning towards stubb exclaimed interrogatively cut meantime pip s blue choked faceplainly looked do for god s sake all passed in a flash in less than half a minute this entire thing happened damn him cut roared stubb and so the whale was lostand pip was saved so soon as he recovered himself the poor little negro was assailedby yells and execrations from the crew tranquilly permittingthese irregular cursings to evaporate stubb then in a plain business like but still half humorous manner cursed pip officially and that done unofficially gave him much wholesome advice the substance was never jump from a boat pip except but allthe rest was indefinite as the soundest advice ever is now in general stick to the boat is your true motto in whaling but cases will sometimes happen when leap from the boat is still better moreover as if perceiving at last that if he should give undilutedconscientious advice to pip he would be leaving him too wide a marginto jump in for the future stubb suddenly dropped all advice and concluded with a peremptory command stick to the boat pip or by the lord i won t pick you up if you jump mind that we can t afford to lose whales by the likes of you a whale would sellfor thirty times what you would pip in alabama bear that in mind and don t jump any more hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hinted that though man loved his fellow yet man is a money making animal which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence but we are all in the hands of the gods and pip jumped again it was under very similar circumstances to the first performance but this time he did not breast out the line and hence when the whalestarted to run pip was left behind on the sea like a hurriedtraveller s trunk alas stubb was but too true to his word it was a beautiful bounteous blue day the spangled sea calmand cool and flatly stretching away all round to the horizon like gold beater s skin hammered out to the extremest bobbing upand down in that sea pip s ebon head showed like a head of cloves no boat knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern stubb s inexorable back was turned upon him and the whale was winged in three minutes a whole mile of shoreless ocean was betweenpip and stubb out from the centre of the sea poor pip turnedhis crisp curling black head to the sun another lonely castaway though the loftiest and the brightest now in calm weather to swim in the open ocean is as easyto the practised swimmer as to ride in a spring carriage ashore but the awful lonesomeness is intolerable the intense concentrationof self in the middle of such a heartless immensity my god who cantell it mark how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides but had stubb really abandoned the poor little negroto his fate no he did not mean to at least because there were two boats in his wake and he supposed no doubt that they would of course come up to pip very quickly and pick him up though indeed such considerations towardsoarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity is notalways manifested by the hunters in all similar instances and such instances not unfrequently occur almost invariablyin the fishery a coward so called is marked with the sameruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies but it so happened that those boats without seeing pip suddenly spying whales close to them on one side turned and gave chase and stubb s boat was now so far away and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish that pip sringed horizon began to expand around him miserably by the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot such at least they said he was the sea had jeeringly kepthis finite body up but drowned the infinite of his soul not drowned entirely though rather carried down aliveto wondrous depths where strange shapes of the unwarpedprimal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes and the miser merman wisdom revealed his hoarded heaps and among the joyous heartless ever juvenile eternities pip saw the multitudinous god omnipresent coral insects that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs he saw god s foot upon the treadle of the loom and spoke it and therefore his shipmates called him mad so man s insanityis heaven s sense and wandering from all mortal reason man comes at last to that celestial thought which to reason is absurd and frantic and weal or woe feels then uncompromised indifferent as his god for the rest blame not stubb too hardly the thing is commonin that fishery and in the sequel of the narrative it will thenbe seen what like abandonment befell myself chapter a squeeze of the handthat whale of stubb s so dearly purchased was duly broughtto the pequod s side where all those cutting and hoistingoperations previously detailed were regularly gone through even to the baling of the heidelburgh tun or case while some were occupied with this latter duty others were employedin dragging away the larger tubs so soon as filled with the sperm and when the proper time arrived this same sperm was carefullymanipulated ere going to the try works of which anon it had cooled and crystallized to such a degree that when with several others i sat down before a large constantine sbath of it i found it strangely concreted into lumps here and there rolling about in the liquid part it was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid a sweet and unctuous duty no wonder that in old times thissperm was such a favorite cosmetic such a clearer sucha sweetener such a softener such a delicious mollifier after having my hands in it for only a few minutes my fingers feltlike eels and began as it were to serpentine and spiralize as i sat there at my ease cross legged on the deck after the bitterexertion at the windlass under a blue tranquil sky the shipunder indolent sail and gliding so serenely along as i bathedmy hands among those soft gentle globules of infiltrated tissues woven almost within the hour as they richly broke to my fingers and discharged all their opulence like fully ripe grapestheir wine as i snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma literally and truly like the smell of spring violets i declare to you that for the time i lived as in a musky meadow i forgot all about our horrible oath in that inexpressible sperm i washed my hands and my heart of it i almost began to creditthe old paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtuein allaying the heat of anger while bathing in that bath i felt divinely free from all ill will or petulance or malice of any sort whatsoever squeeze squeeze squeeze all the morning long i squeezedthat sperm till i myself almost melted into it i squeezedthat sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me and i found myself unwittingly squeezing my co laborers hands in it mistaking their hands for the gentle globules such an abounding affectionate friendly loving feeling didthis avocation beget that at last i was continually squeezingtheir hands and looking up into their eyes sentimentally as much as to say oh my dear fellow beings why should we longercherish any social acerbities or know the slightest ill humoror envy come let us squeeze hands all round nay let usall squeeze ourselves into each other let us squeeze ourselvesuniversally into the very milk and sperm of kindness would that i could keep squeezing that sperm for ever for now since by many prolonged repeated experiences i have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower or at least shift his conceit of attainable felicity not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy but in the wife the heart the bed the table the saddle the fire side the country now that i have perceived all this i am ready to squeeze case eternally in thoughts of thevisions of the night i saw long rows of angels in paradise each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti now while discoursing of sperm it behooves to speak of other things akinto it in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try works first comes white horse so called which is obtained from the taperingpart of the fish and also from the thicker portions of his flukes it is tough with congealed tendons a wad of muscle but still containssome oil after being severed from the whale the white horseis first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer they look much like blocks of berkshire marble plum pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts ofthe whale s flesh here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness it is a most refreshing convivial beautiful object to behold as its name imports it is of an exceedingly rich mottled tint with abestreaked snowy and golden ground dotted with spots of the deepestcrimson and purple it is plums of rubies in pictures of citron spite of reason it is hard to keep yourself from eating it i confess that once i stole behind the foremast to try it it tasted something as i should conceive a royal cutlet fromthe thigh of louis le gros might have tasted supposing himto have been killed the first day after the venison season and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusuallyfine vintage of the vineyards of champagne there is another substance and a very singular one which turnsup in the course of this business but which i feel it to bevery puzzling adequately to describe it is called slobgollion an appellation original with the whalemen and even so isthe nature of the substance it is an ineffably oozy stringy affair most frequently found in the tubs of sperm after a prolonged squeezing and subsequent decanting i hold it to be the wondrously thin ruptured membranesof the case coalescing gurry so called is a term properly belonging to right whalemen but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen it designates the dark glutinous substance which is scraped offthe back of the greenland or right whale and much of which coversthe decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble leviathan nippers strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale s vocabulary but as applied by whalemen it becomes so a whaleman s nipperis a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the taperingpart of leviathan s tail it averages an inch in thickness and for the rest is about the size of the iron part of a hoe edgewise moved along the oily deck it operates like a leathern squilgee and by nameless blandishments as of magic allures along withit all impurities but to learn all about these recondite matters your best way is at onceto descend into the blubber room and have a long talk with its inmates this place has previously been mentioned as the receptaclefor the blanket pieces when stript and hoisted from the whale when the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents this apartmentis a scene of terror to all tyros especially by night on one side lit by a dull lantern a space has been left clear for the workmen they generally go in pairs a pike and gaffman and a spade man thewhaling pike is similar to a frigate s boarding weapon of the same name the gaff is something like a boat hook with his gaff the gaffmanhooks on to a sheet of blubber and strives to hold it from slipping as the ship pitches and lurches about meanwhile the spade man standson the sheet itself perpendicularly chopping it into the portablehorse pieces this spade is sharp as hone can make it the spademan sfeet are shoeless the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistiblyslide away from him like a sledge if he cuts off one of his own toes or one of his assistants would you be very much astonished toes are scarce among veteran blubber room men chapter the cassockhad you stepped on board the pequod at a certain juncture of thispost mortemizing of the whale and had you strolled forward nighthe windlass pretty sure am i that you would have scanned with nosmall curiosity a very strange enigmatical object which you wouldhave seen there lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers not the wondrous cistern in the whale s huge head not the prodigyof his unhinged lower jaw not the miracle of his symmetrical tail none of these would so surprise you as half a glimpse ofthat unaccountable cone longer than a kentuckian is tall nigh a foot in diameter at the base and jet black as yojo the ebony idol of queequeg and an idol indeed it is or rather in old times its likeness was such an idolas that found in the secret groves of queen maachah in judea and for worshipping which king asa her son did depose her and destroyed the idol and burnt it for an abominationat the brook kedron as darkly set forth in the th chapterof the first book of kings look at the sailor called the mincer who now comes along and assisted by two allies heavily backs the grandissimus as the mariners call it and with bowed shoulders staggers off with itas if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field extending it upon the forecastle deck he now proceeds cylindricallyto remove its dark pelt as an african hunter the pelt of a boa this done he turns the pelt inside out like a pantaloon leg gives it a good stretching so as almost to double its diameter and at last hangs it well spread in the rigging to dry ere long it is taken down when removing some three feet of it towards the pointed extremity and then cutting two slits for arm holesat the other end he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it the mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicalsof his calling immemorial to all his order this investiturealone will adequately protect him while employed in the peculiarfunctions of his office that office consists in mincing the horse pieces of blubberfor the pots an operation which is conducted at a curiouswooden horse planted endwise against the bulwarks and with a capacious tub beneath it into which the mincedpieces drop fast as the sheets from a rapt orator s desk arrayed in decent black occupying a conspicuous pulpit intent on bible leaves what a candidate for an archbishopric what a lad for a pope were this mincer bible leaves bible leaves this is the invariable cryfrom the mates to the mincer it enjoins him to be careful and cut his work into as thin slices as possible inasmuch as byso doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated and its quantity considerably increased besides perhaps improvingit in quality chapter the try worksbesides her hoisted boats an american whaler is outwardly distinguishedby her try works she presents the curious anomaly of the most solidmasonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship it is as if from the open field a brick kiln were transportedto her planks the try works are planted between the foremast and mainmast the most roomy part of the deck the timbers beneath are of apeculiar strength fitted to sustain the weight of an almostsolid mass of brick and mortar some ten feet by eight square and five in height the foundation does not penetrate the deck but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderousknees of iron bracing it on all sides and screwing it downto the timbers on the flanks it is cased with wood and at topcompletely covered by a large sloping battened hatchway removing this hatch we expose the great try pots two in number and each of several barrels capacity when not in use they are kept remarkably clean sometimes they are polished withsoapstone and sand till they shine within like silver punchbowls during the night watches some cynical old sailors willcrawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap while employed in polishing them one man in each pot side by side many confidential communications are carried on over the iron lips it is a place also for profound mathematical meditation it was in the left hand try pot of the pequod with the soapstonediligently circling round me that i was first indirectly struckby the remarkable fact that in geometry all bodies glidingalong the cycloid my soapstone for example will descendfrom any point in precisely the same time removing the fire board from the front of the try works the bare masonry of that side is exposed penetrated by the twoiron mouths of the furnaces directly underneath the pots these mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron the intense heatof the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entireinclosed surface of the works by a tunnel inserted at the rear this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast as it evaporates there are no external chimneys they open direct from the rear wall and here let us go back for a moment it was about nine o clock at night that the pequod stry works were first started on this present voyage it belonged to stubb to oversee the business all ready there off hatch then and start her you cook fire the works this was an easy thing for the carpenter had beenthrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in thetry works has to be fed for a time with wood after that no woodis used except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel in a word after being tried out the crisp shrivelled blubber now called scraps or fritters still contains considerableof its unctuous properties these fritters feed the flames like a plethoric burning martyr or a self consuming misanthrope once ignited the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body would that he consumed his own smoke for his smoke is horribleto inhale and inhale it you must and not only that but you mustlive in it for the time it has an unspeakable wild hindoo odorabout it such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres it smells like the left wing of the day of judgment it is an argumentfor the pit by midnight the works were in full operation we were clear from the carcass sail had been made the wind was freshening the wild ocean darkness was intense but that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames which atintervals forked forth from the sooty flues and illuminatedevery lofty rope in the rigging as with the famed greek fire the burning ship drove on as if remorselessly commissionedto some vengeful deed so the pitch and sulphur freighted brigsof the bold hydriote canaris issuing from their midnight harbors with broad sheets of flame for sails bore down uponthe turkish frigates and folded them in conflagrations the hatch removed from the top of the works now afforded a widehearth in front of them standing on this were the tartareanshapes of the pagan harpooneers always the whale ship s stokers with huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber intothe scalding pots or stirred up the fires beneath till the snakyflames darted curling out of the doors to catch them by the feet the smoke rolled away in sullen heaps to every pitch of the shipthere was a pitch of the boiling oil which seemed all eagernessto leap into their faces opposite the mouth of the works on the further side of the wide wooden hearth was the windlass this served for a sea sofa here lounged the watch when nototherwise employed looking into the red heat of the fire till their eyes felt scorched in their heads their tawny features now all begrimed with smoke and sweat their matted beards and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth all these werestrangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works as they narrated to each other their unholy adventures their talesof terror told in words of mirth as their uncivilized laughterforked upwards out of them like the flames from the furnace as to and fro in their front the harpooneers wildly gesticulatedwith their huge pronged forks and dippers as the wind howled on and the sea leaped and the ship groaned and dived and yet steadfastlyshot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the seaand the night and scornfully champed the white bone in her mouth and viciously spat round her on all sides then the rushing pequod freighted with savages and laden with fire and burning a corpse and plunging into that blackness of darkness seemed the materialcounterpart of her monomaniac commander s soul so seemed it to me as i stood at her helm and for longhours silently guided the way of this fire ship on the sea wrapped for that interval in darkness myself i but the bettersaw the redness the madness the ghastliness of others the continual sight of the fiend shapes before me capering halfin smoke and half in fire these at last begat kindred visionsin my soul so soon as i began to yield to that unaccountabledrowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm but that night in particular a strange and ever since inexplicable thing occurred to me starting from a brief standing sleep i was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong the jaw bone tiller smote my side which leaned against it in myears was the low hum of sails just beginning to shake in the wind i thought my eyes were open i was half conscious of puttingmy fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching them stillfurther apart but spite of all this i could see no compassbefore me to steer by though it seemed but a minute since i had beenwatching the card by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom now and then madeghastly by flashes of redness uppermost was the impression that whatever swift rushing thing i stood on was not so muchbound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern a stark bewildered feeling as of death came over me convulsively my hands grasped the tiller but with the crazy conceitthat the tiller was somehow in some enchanted way inverted my god what is the matter with me thought i lo in mybrief sleep i had turned myself about and was frontingthe ship s stern with my back to her prow and the compass in an instant i faced back just in time to prevent the vesselfrom flying up into the wind and very probably capsizing her how glad and how grateful the relief from this unnaturalhallucination of the night and the fatal contingency of beingbrought by the lee look not too long in the face of the fire o man never dreamwith thy hand on the helm turn not thy back to the compass accept the first hint of the hitching tiller believe not theartificial fire when its redness makes all things look ghastly to morrow in the natural sun the skies will be bright those who glared like devils in the forking flames the mornwill show in far other at least gentler relief the glorious golden glad sun the only true lamp all others but liars nevertheless the sun hides not virginia s dismal swamp nor rome s accursed campagna nor wide sahara nor all themillions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon the sun hides not the ocean which is the dark side of this earth and which is two thirds of this earth so therefore that mortalman who hath more of joy than sorrow in him that mortal mancannot be true not true or undeveloped with books the same the truest of all men was the man of sorrows and the truestof all books is solomon s and ecclesiastes is the finehammered steel of woe all is vanity all this wilfulworld hath not got hold of unchristian solomon s wisdom yet but he who dodges hospitals and jails and walks fastcrossing graveyards and would rather talk of operas than hell calls cowper young pascal rousseau poor devils all of sick men and throughout a care free lifetime swears by rabelaisas passing wise and therefore jolly not that man is fittedto sit down on tomb stones and break the green damp mouldwith unfathomably wondrous solomon but even solomon he says the man that wandereth out ofthe way of understanding shall remain i e even while living in the congregation of the dead give not thyself up then to fire lest it invert thee deaden thee as for the time it did me there is a wisdom that is woe but there is a woe that is madness and there is a catskill eagle in some souls that can alikedive down into the blackest gorges and soar out of them againand become invisible in the sunny spaces and even if he forever flies within the gorge that gorge is in the mountains so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is stillhigher than other birds upon the plain even though they soar chapter the lamphad you descended from the pequod s try works to the pequod s forecastle where the off duty watch were sleeping for one single moment youwould have almost thought you were standing in some illuminatedshrine of canonized kings and counsellors there they lay intheir triangular oaken vaults each mariner a chiselled muteness a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes in merchantmen oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milkof queens to dress in the dark and eat in the dark and stumble in darkness to his pallet this is his usual lot but the whaleman as he seeks the food of light so he lives in light he makes his berth an aladdin s lamp and lays him down in it so that in the pitchiest night the ship s black hull stillhouses an illumination see with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handfulof lamps often but old bottles and vials though to thecopper cooler at the tryworks and replenishes them there as mugs of ale at a vat he burns too the purest of oil in its unmanufactured and therefore unvitiated state a fluid unknown to solar lunar or astral contrivances ashore it is sweet as early grass butter in april he goes and huntsfor his oil so as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his ownsupper of game chapter stowing down and clearing upalready has it been related how the great leviathan is afar offdescried from the mast head how he is chased over the watery moors and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep how he is then towed alongsideand beheaded and how on the principle which entitled the headsmanof old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed his great paddedsurtout becomes the property of his executioner how in due time he is condemned to the pots and like shadrach meshach and abednego his spermaceti oil and bone pass unscathed through the fire but nowit remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the descriptionby rehearsing singing if i may the romantic proceeding of decantingoff his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities sliding along beneath the surface is before but alas never moreto rise and blow while still warm the oil like hot punch is received intothe six barrel casks and while perhaps the ship is pitchingand rolling this way and that in the midnight sea the enormouscasks are slewed round and headed over end for end and sometimesperilously scoot across the slippery deck like so many land slides till at last man handled and stayed in their course and all roundthe hoops rap rap go as many hammers as can play upon them for now ex officio every sailor is a cooper at length when the last pint is casked and all is cool then the great hatchways are unsealed the bowels of the ship arethrown open and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea this done the hatches are replaced and hermetically closed like a closet walled up in the sperm fishery this is perhaps one of the mostremarkable incidents in all the business of whaling one day the planks stream with freshets of blood and oil on the sacred quarter deck enormous masses of the whale s head areprofanely piled great rusty casks lie about as in a brewery yard the smoke from the try works has besooted all the bulwarks the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness the entireship seems great leviathan himself while on all handsthe din is deafening but a day or two after you look about you and prick your earsin this self same ship and were it not for the tell tale boatsand try works you would all but swear you trod some silentmerchant vessel with a most scrupulously neat commander the unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue this is the reason why the decks never look so white as justafter what they call an affair of oil besides from the ashesof the burned scraps of the whale a potent lye is readily made and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remainsclinging to the side that lye quickly exterminates it hands go diligently along the bulwarks and with bucketsof water and rags restore them to their full tidiness the soot is brushed from the lower rigging all the numerousimplements which have been in use are likewise faithfullycleansed and put away the great hatch is scrubbed and placedupon the try works completely hiding the pots every caskis out of sight all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of almostthe entire ship s company the whole of this conscientiousduty is at last concluded then the crew themselves proceedto their own ablutions shift themselves from top to toe and finally issue to the immaculate deck fresh and all aglowas bridegrooms new leaped from out the daintiest holland now with elated step they pace the planks in twos and threes and humorously discourse of parlors sofas carpets and fine cambrics propose to mat the deck think of having hangings to the top object not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle to hint to such musked mariners of oil and bone and blubber were little short of audacity they know not the thing you distantlyallude to away and bring us napkins but mark aloft there at the three mast heads stand threemen intent on spying out more whales which if caught infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture and dropat least one small grease spot somewhere yes and many isthe time when after the severest uninterrupted labors which knowno night continuing straight through for ninety six hours when from the boat where they have swelled their wristswith all day rowing on the line they only step to the deckto carry vast chains and heave the heavy windlass and cutand slash yea and in their very sweatings to be smokedand burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sunand the equatorial try works when on the heel of all this they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship and makea spotless dairy room of it many is the time the poor fellows just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks are startledby the cry of there she blows and away they fly to fightanother whale and go through the whole weary thing again oh my friends but this is man killing yet this is life for hardly have we mortals by long toilings extracted from thisworld s vast bulk its small but valuable sperm and then with weary patience cleansed ourselves from its defilements and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul hardly is this done when there she blows the ghostis spouted up and away we sail to fight some other world and go through young life s old routine again oh the metempsychosis oh pythagoras that in bright greece two thousand years ago did die so good so wise so mild i sailedwith thee along the peruvian coast last voyage and foolish as i am taught thee a green simple boy how to splice a rope chapter the doubloonere now it has been related how ahab was wont to pace his quarter deck taking regular turns at either limit the binnacle and mainmast but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration ithas not been added how that sometimes in these walks when mostplunged in his mood he was wont to pause in turn at each spot and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him when he halted before the binnacle with his glance fastened onthe pointed needle in the compass that glance shot like a javelinwith the pointed intensity of his purpose and when resuming his walkhe again paused before the mainmast then as the same riveted glancefastened upon the riveted gold coin there he still wore the sameaspect of nailed firmness only dashed with a certain wild longing if not hopefulness but one morning turning to pass the doubloon he seemed to be newlyattracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himselfin some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them and some certain significance lurks in all things else all thingsare little worth and the round world itself but an empty cipher except to sell by the cartload as they do hills about boston to fill up some morass in the milky way now this doubloon was of purest virgin gold raked somewhereout of the heart of gorgeous hills whence east and west over golden sands the head waters of many a pactolus flows and though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron boltsand the verdigris of copper spikes yet untouchable and immaculateto any foulness it still preserved its quito glow nor though placedamongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darknesswhich might cover any pilfering approach nevertheless everysunrise found the doubloon where the sunset last left it last for it was set apart and sanctified to one awe striking end and however wanton in their sailor ways one and all the mariners revered it as the white whale s talisman sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night wondering whose it was to be at last and whether he would everlive to spend it now those noble golden coins of south america are as medals of the sunand tropic token pieces here palms alpacas and volcanoes sun s disksand stars ecliptics horns of plenty and rich banners waving are in luxuriant profusion stamped so that the precious gold seemsalmost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories by passing through those fancy mints so spanishly poetic it so chanced that the doubloon of the pequod was a most wealthyexample of these things on its round border it bore the letters republica del ecuador quito so this bright coin came from a countryplanted in the middle of the world and beneath the great equator and named after it and it had been cast midway up the andes in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn zoned by those lettersyou saw the likeness of three andes summits from one a flame a tower on another on the third a crowing cock while archingover all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac the signs allmarked with their usual cabalistics and the keystone sun enteringthe equinoctial point at libra before this equatorial coin ahab not unobserved by others was now pausing there s something ever egotistical in mountain topsand towers and all other grand and lofty things look here three peaks as proud as lucifer the firm tower that is ahab the volcano that is ahab the courageous the undaunted and victorious fowl that too is ahab all are ahab and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe which like a magician s glass to each and every man in turnbut mirrors back his own mysterious self great pains small gains for those who ask the world to solve them it cannotsolve itself methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face but see aye he enters the sign of storms the equinox and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinoxat aries from storm to storm so be it then born in throes t is fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs so be it then here s stout stuff for woe to work on so be it then no fairy fingers can have pressed the gold but devil sclaws must have left their mouldings there since yesterday murmured starbuck to himself leaning against the bulwarks the old man seems to read belshazzar s awful writing i have never marked the coin inspectingly he goes below let me read a dark valley between three mighty heaven abiding peaks that almost seem the trinity in some faint earthly symbol so in this vale of death god girds us round and over all our gloom the sun of righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope if we bend down our eyes the dark vale shows her mouldy soil but if we lift them the bright sun meets our glance half way to cheer yet oh the great sun is no fixture and if at midnight we wouldfain snatch some sweet solace from him we gaze for him in vain this coin speaks wisely mildly truly but still sadly to me i will quit it lest truth shake me falsely there now s the old mogul soliloquized stubb by the try works he s been twigging it and there goes starbuck from the same and both with faces which i should say might be somewherewithin nine fathoms long and all from looking at a pieceof gold which did i have it now on negro hill or incorlaer s hook i d not look at it very long ere spending it humph in my poor insignificant opinion i regard this as queer i have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings your doubloonsof old spain your doubloons of peru your doubloons of chili your doubloons of bolivia your doubloons of popayan with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles and joes and half joes and quarter joes what then should there bein this doubloon of the equator that is so killing wonderful by golconda let me read it once halloa here s signs andwonders truly that now is what old bowditch in his epitomecalls the zodiac and what my almanack below calls ditto i ll get the almanack and as i have heard devils can be raisedwith daboll s arithmetic i ll try my hand at raising a meaningout of these queer curvicues here with the massachusetts calendar here s the book let s see now signs and

words and facts but we comein to supply the thoughts that s my small experience so far as the massachusetts calendar and bowditch s navigator and daboll s arithmetic go signs and wonders eh pity if thereis nothing wonderful in signs and significant in wonders there s a clue somewhere wait a bit hist hark by jove i have it look you doubloon your zodiac here is the life of man in oneround chapter and now i ll read it off straight out of the book come almanack to begin there s aries or the ram lecherous dog he begets us then taurus or the bull he bumps us the first thing then gemini or the twins that is virtue and vice we try to reach virtue when lo comes cancer the crab and drags us back and here going from virtue leo a roaring lion lies in the path he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw we escape and hail virgo the virgin that s our first love we marry and think to be happy for aye when pop comes libra or the scales happiness weighed and found wanting and while weare very sad about that lord how we suddenly jump as scorpio or the scorpion stings us in the rear we are curing the wound when whang comes the arrows all round sagittarius or the archer is amusing himself as we pluck out the shafts stand aside here s the battering ram capricornus or the goat full tilt he comes rushing and headlong we are tossed when aquarius or the waterbearer pours out his whole deluge and drowns us and to wind up with pisces or the fishes we sleep there s a sermon now writ in high heaven and the sun goes throughit every year and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty jollily he aloft there wheels through toil and trouble and so alow here does jolly stubb oh jolly s the word for aye adieu doubloon but stop here comes little king post dodge round the try works now and let s hear what he ll haveto say there he s before it he ll out with something presently so so he s beginning i see nothing here but a round thing made of gold and whoever raisesa certain whale this round thing belongs to him so what s allthis staring been about it is worth sixteen dollars that s true and at two cents the cigar that s nine hundred and sixty cigars i won t smoke dirty pipes like stubb but i like cigars and here s ninehundred and sixty of them so here goes flask aloft to spy em out shall i call that wise or foolish now if it be really wise it hasa foolish look to it yet if it be really foolish then has it a sortof wiseish look to it but avast here comes our old manxman the oldhearse driver he must have been that is before he took to the sea he luffs up before the doubloon halloa and goes round on the otherside of the mast why there s a horse shoe nailed on that side and now he s back again what does that mean hark he s muttering voice like an old worn out coffee mill prick ears and listen if the white whale be raised it must be in a month and a day when the sun stands in some one of these signs i ve studied signs and know their marks they were taught me two score years ago by the old witch in copenhagen now in what sign will the sun then be the horse shoe sign for there it is right opposite the gold and what s the horse shoe sign the lion is the horse shoe sign the roaring and devouring lion ship old ship my old head shakesto think of thee there s another rendering now but still one text all sorts of menin one kind of world you see

london ship ahoy hast seen the white whale so cried ahab once more hailing a ship showing english colors bearing down under the stern trumpet to mouth the old man was standingin his hoisted quarter deck his ivory leg plainly revealed to thestranger captain who was carelessly reclining in his own boat s bow he was a darkly tanned burly goodnatured fine looking man of sixtyor thereabouts dressed in a spacious roundabout that hung round himin festoons of blue pilot cloth and one empty arm of this jacketstreamed behind him like the broidered arm of a huzzar s surcoat hast seen the white whale see you this and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone terminating in a woodenhead like a mallet man my boat cried ahab impetuously and tossing about the oarsnear him stand by to lower in less than a minute without quitting his little craft he and his crew were dropped to the water and were soon alongsideof the stranger but here a curious difficulty presented itself in the excitement of the moment ahab had forgotten that sincethe loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of anyvessel at sea but his own and then it was always by an ingeniousand very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the pequod and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel ata moment s warning now it is no very easy matter for anybody except those who are almost hourly used to it like whalemen to clamber up a ship s side from a boat on the open sea for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson so deprived of one leg and the strange ship of course beingaltogether unsupplied with the kindly invention ahab nowfound himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardlyhope to attain it has before been hinted perhaps that every little untowardcircumstance that befell him and which indirectly sprangfrom his luckless mishap almost invariably irritated orexasperated ahab and in the present instance all this was heightenedby the sight of the two officers of the strange ship leaning overthe side by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there and swinging towards him a pair of tastefully ornamented man ropes for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a one leggedman must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannisters but this awkwardness only lasted a minute because the strange captain observing at a glance how affairs stood cried out i see i see avast heaving there jump boys and swing over the cutting tackle as good luck would have it they had had a whale alongside a day ortwo previous and the great tackles were still aloft and the massivecurved blubber hook now clean and dry was still attached to the end this was quickly lowered to ahab who at once comprehending it all slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook it was likesitting in the fluke of an anchor or the crotch of an apple tree and then giving the word held himself fast and at the same timealso helped to hoist his own weight by pulling hand over hand uponone of the running parts of the tackle soon he was carefully swunginside the high bulwarks and gently landed upon the capstan head with his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome the othercaptain advanced and ahab putting out his ivory leg and crossingthe ivory arm like two sword fish blades cried out in his walrus way aye aye hearty let us shake bones together an arm and a leg an arm that never can shrink d ye see and a leg that never can run where did st thou see the white whale how long ago the white whale said the englishman pointing his ivory armtowards the east and taking a rueful sight along it as if ithad been a telescope there i saw him on the line last season and he took that arm off did he asked ahab now slidingdown from the capstan and resting on the englishman s shoulder as he did so aye he was the cause of it at least and that leg too spin me the yarn said ahab how was it it was the first time in my life that i ever cruised on the line began the englishman i was ignorant of the white whale at that time well one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales and myboat fastened to one of them a regular circus horse he was too that went milling and milling round so that my boat s crew couldonly trim dish by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale with a milky white head and hump all crows feet and wrinkles it was he it was he cried ahab suddenly letting outhis suspended breath and harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin aye aye they were mine my irons cried ahab exultingly but on give me a chance then said the englishman good humoredly well this old great grandfather with the white head and hump runs all afoaminto the pod and goes to snapping furiously at my fast line aye i see wanted to part it free the fast fish an old trick i know him how it was exactly continued the one armed commander i do not know but in biting the line it got foul of his teeth caught there somehow but we didn t know it then so that when weafterwards pulled on the line bounce we came plump on to his hump instead of the other whale s that went off to windward all fluking seeing how matters stood and what a noble great whale it was the noblest and biggest i ever saw sir in my life i resolvedto capture him spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in and thinking the hap hazard line would get loose or the toothit was tangled to might draw for i have a devil of a boat screw for a pull on a whale line seeing all this i say i jumped into my first mate s boat mr mounttop s here by the way captain mounttop mounttop the captain as i was saying i jumped into mounttop s boat which d ye see was gunwale and gunwale with mine then and snatching thefirst harpoon let this old great grandfather have it but lord look you sir hearts and souls alive man the next instant in a jiff i was blind as a bat both eyes out all befoggedand bedeadened with black foam the whale s tail looming straightup out of it perpendicular in the air like a marble steeple no use sterning all then but as i was groping at midday with a blinding sun all crown jewels as i was groping i say after the second iron to toss it overboard down comes the taillike a lima tower cutting my boat in two leaving each halfin splinters and flukes first the white hump backed throughthe wreck as though it was all chips we all struck out to escape his terrible flailings i seized hold of my harpoon polesticking in him and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish but a combing sea dashed me off and at the same instant the fish taking one good dart forwards went down like a flash and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near mecaught me here clapping his hand just below his shoulder yes caught me just here i say and bore me down tohell s flames i was thinking when when all of a sudden thank the good god the barb ript its way along the flesh clear along the whole length of my arm came out nigh my wrist and up i floated and that gentleman there will tell you the rest by the way captain dr bunger ship s surgeon bunger my lad the captain now bunger boy spin your part of the yarn the professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out had been all the time standing near them with nothingspecific visible to denote his gentlemanly rank on board his face was an exceedingly round but sober one he was dressedin a faded blue woollen frock or shirt and patched trowsers and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspikehe held in one hand and a pill box held in the other occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs ofthe two crippled captains but at his superior s introductionof him to ahab he politely bowed and straightway went onto do his captain s bidding it was a shocking bad wound began the whale surgeon and taking my advice captain boomer here stood our old sammy samuel enderby is the name of my ship interrupted theone armed captain addressing ahab go on boy stood our old sammy off to the northward to get out of the blazinghot weather there on the line but it was no use i did all i could sat up with him nights was very severe with him in the matter of diet oh very severe chimed in the patient himself then suddenlyaltering his voice drinking hot rum toddies with me every night till he couldn t see to put on the bandages and sending meto bed half seas over about three o clock in the morning oh ye stars he sat up with me indeed and was very severein my diet oh a great watcher and very dietetically severe is dr bunger bunger you dog laugh out why don t ye you know you re a precious jolly rascal but heave ahead boy i d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man my captain you must have ere this perceived respected sir said the imperturbable godly looking bunger slightly bowingto ahab is apt to be facetious at times he spins us manyclever things of that sort but i may as well say en passant as the french remark that i myself that is to say jack bunger late of the reverend clergy am a strict total abstinence man i never drink water cried the captain he never drinks it it s a sortof fits to him fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia but go on go on with the arm story yes i may as well said the surgeon coolly i was aboutobserving sir before captain boomer s facetious interruption that spite of my best and severest endeavors the wound kept gettingworse and worse the truth was sir it was as ugly gaping woundas surgeon ever saw more than two feet and several inches long i measured it with the lead line in short it grew black i knew what was threatened and off it came but i had no handin shipping that ivory arm there that thing is against all rule pointing at it with the marlingspike that is the captain s work not mine he ordered the carpenter to make it he had that club hammerthere put to the end to knock some one s brains out with i suppose as he tried mine once he flies into diabolical passions sometimes do ye see this dent sir removing his hat and brushing aside his hair and exposing a bowl like cavity in his skull but which bore notthe slightest scarry trace or any token of ever having been a wound well the captain there will tell you how that came there he knows no i don t said the captain but his mother did he was born with it oh you solemn rogue you you bunger was there ever such another bunger in the watery world bunger when you die you ought to die in pickle you dog you should be preserved to future ages you rascal what became of the white whale now cried ahab who thus far had beenimpatiently listening to this byeplay between the two englishmen oh cried the one armed captain oh yes well after he sounded we didn t see him again for some time in fact as i before hinted i didn t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick till some time afterwards when coming back to the line we heardabout moby dick as some call him and then i knew it was he did st thou cross his wake again twice but could not fasten didn t want to try to ain t one limb enough what should ido without this other arm and i m thinking moby dick doesn tbite so much as he swallows well then interrupted bunger give him your left arm forbait to get the right do you know gentlemen very gravelyand mathematically bowing to each captain in succession doyou know gentlemen that the digestive organs of the whaleare so inscrutably constructed by divine providence that it isquite impossible for him to completely digest even a man s arm and he knows it too so that what you take for the white whale smalice is only his awkwardness for he never means toswallow a single limb he only thinks to terrify by feints but sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow formerly a patientof mine in ceylon that making believe swallow jack knives once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more when i gavehim an emetic and he heaved it up in small tacks d ye see no possible way for him to digest that jack knife and fullyincorporate it into his general bodily system yes captain boomer if you are quick enough about it and have a mind to pawnone arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burialto the other why in that case the arm is yours only letthe whale have another chance at you shortly that s all no thank you bunger said the english captain he s welcometo the arm he has since i can t help it and didn t knowhim then but not to another one no more white whales for me i ve lowered for him once and that has satisfied me there would be great glory in killing him i know that and there is a ship load of precious sperm in him but hark ye he s best let alone don t you think so captain glancing atthe ivory leg he is but he will still be hunted for all that what is bestlet alone that accursed thing is not always what least allures he s all a magnet how long since thou saw st him last which way heading bless my soul and curse the foul fiend s cried bunger stoopingly walking round ahab and like a dog strangely snuffing this man s blood bring the thermometer it s at the boiling point his pulse makes these planks beat sir taking a lancet fromhis pocket and drawing near to ahab s arm avast roared ahab dashing him against the bulwarks man the boat which way heading good god cried the english captain to whom the question was put what s the matter he was heading east i think is yourcaptain crazy whispering fedallah but fedallah putting a finger on his lip slid over the bulwarksto take the boat s steering oar and ahab swinging the cutting tackletowards him commanded the ship s sailors to stand by to lower in a moment he was standing in the boat s stern and the manilla menwere springing to their oars in vain the english captain hailed him with back to the stranger ship and face set like a flint to his own ahab stood upright till alongside of the pequod chapter the decanterere the english ship fades from sight be it set down here that shehailed from london and was named after the late samuel enderby merchant of that city the original of the famous whaling houseof enderby and sons a house which in my poor whaleman s opinion comes not far behind the united royal houses of the tudors and bourbons in point of real historical interest how long prior to the yearof our lord this great whaling house was in existence my numerous fish documents do not make plain but in that year it fitted out the first english ships that ever regularlyhunted the sperm whale though for some score of years previous ever since our valiant coffins and maceys of nantucketand the vineyard had in large fleets pursued the leviathan but only in the north and south atlantic not elsewhere be it distinctly recorded here that the nantucketers were the firstamong mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great sperm whale and that for half a century they were the only people of the wholeglobe who so harpooned him in a fine ship the amelia fitted out for the express purpose and at the sole charge of the vigorous enderbys boldly roundedcape horn and was the first among the nations to lower a whale boatof any sort in the great south sea the voyage was a skilfuland lucky one and returning to her berth with her hold fullof the precious sperm the amelia s example was soon followedby other ships english and american and thus the vast sperm whalegrounds of the pacific were thrown open but not content with thisgood deed the indefatigable house again bestirred itself samuel and all his sons how many their mother only knows and undertheir immediate auspices and partly i think at their expense the british government was induced to send the sloop of war rattleron a whaling voyage of discovery into the south sea commanded bya naval post captain the rattler made a rattling voyage of it and did some service how much does not appear but this is not all in the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of japan that ship well called the syren made a noble experimental cruise and it was thus that the great japanese whaling ground first becamegenerally known the syren in this famous voyage was commandedby a captain coffin a nantucketer all honor to the enderbies therefore whose house i think exists to the present day though doubtless the original samuelmust long ago have slipped his cable for the great south seaof the other world the ship named after him was worthy of the honor being a very fast sailerand a noble craft every way i boarded her once at midnight somewhereoff the patagonian coast and drank good flip down in the forecastle it was a fine gam we had and they were all trumps every soul on board a short life to them and a jolly death and that fine gam i had long very long after old ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel it minds me of the noble solid saxon hospitality of that ship and may my parson forget me and the devil remember me if i everlose sight of it flip did i say we had flip yes and we flippedit at the rate of ten gallons the hour and when the squall came for it s squally off there by patagonia and all hands visitors and all were called to reef topsails we were so top heavythat we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines and we ignorantlyfurled the skirts of our jackets into the sails so that we hung there reefed fast in the howling gale a warning example to all drunken tars however the masts did not go overboard and by and by we scrambled down so sober that we had to pass the flip again though the savage saltspray bursting down the forecastle scuttle rather too much dilutedand pickled it for my taste the beef was fine tough but with body in it they said it was bullbeef others that it was dromedary beef but i do not know for certain how that was they haddumplings too small but substantial symmetrically globular and indestructible dumplings i fancied that you could feel them and roll them about in you after they were swallowed if you stooped over too far forward you risked theirpitching out of you like billiard balls the bread but that couldn t be helped besides it was an anti scorbutic in short the bread contained the only fresh fare they had but the forecastle was not very light and it was very easyto step over into a dark corner when you ate it but all in all taking her from truck to helm considering the dimensionsof the cook s boilers including his own live parchment boilers fore and aft i say the samuel enderby was a jolly ship of good fare and plenty fine flip and strong crack fellows all and capital from boot heels to hat band but why was it think ye that the samuel enderby and some otherenglish whalers i know of not all though were such famous hospitable ships that passed round the beef and the bread and the can and the joke and were not soon weary of eating and drinking and laughing i will tell you the abounding goodcheer of these english whalers is matter for historical research nor have i been at all sparing of historical whale research when it has seemed needed the english were preceded in the whale fishery bythe hollanders zealanders and danes from whom they derivedmany terms still extant in the fishery and what is yet more their fat old fashions touching plenty to eat and drink for as a general thing the english merchant ship scrimps her crew but not so the english whaler hence in the english this thingof whaling good cheer is not normal and natural but incidentaland particular and therefore must have some special origin which is here pointed out and will be still further elucidated during my researches in the leviathanic histories i stumbled uponan ancient dutch volume which by the musty whaling smell of it i knew must be about whalers the title was dan coopman wherefore i concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirsof some amsterdam cooper in the fishery as every whale ship mustcarry its cooper i was reinforced in this opinion by seeingthat it was the production of one fitz swackhammer but myfriend dr snodhead a very learned man professor of low dutchand high german in the college of santa claus and st potts to whom i handed the work for translation giving him a box of spermcandles for his trouble this same dr snodhead so soon as he spiedthe book assured me that dan coopman did not mean the cooper but the merchant in short this ancient and learned low dutchbook treated of the commerce of holland and among other subjects contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery and in this chapter it was headed smeer or fat that ifound a long detailed list of the outfits for the lardersand cellars of sail of dutch whalemen from which list as translated by dr snodhead i transcribe the following lbs of beef lbs friesland pork lbs of stock fish lbs of biscuit lbs of soft bread firkins of butter lbs of texel and leyden cheese lbs cheese probably an inferior article ankers of geneva barrels of beer most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading not so in the present case however where the reader is floodedwith whole pipes barrels quarts and gills of good ginand good cheer at the time i devoted three days to the studious digesting of allthis beer beef and bread during which many profound thoughtswere incidentally suggested to me capable of a transcendentaland platonic application and furthermore i compiled supplementarytables of my own touching the probable quantity of stock fish c consumed by every low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenlandand spitzbergen whale fishery in the first place the amountof butter and texel and leyden cheese consumed seems amazing i impute it though to their naturally unctuous natures being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid polar seas on the very coasts of that esquimaux country where the convivialnatives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil the quantity of the beer too is very large barrels now as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the shortsummer of that climate so that the whole cruise of one of these dutchwhalemen including the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea did not much exceed three months say and reckoning mento each of their fleet of sail we have low dutch seamenin all therefore i say we have precisely two barrels of beerper man for a twelve weeks allowance exclusive of his fairproportion of that ankers of gin now whether these gin andbeer harpooneers so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat s head and takegood aim at flying whales this would seem somewhat improbable yet they did aim at them and hit them too but this was very far north be it remembered where beer agrees well with the constitution upon the equator in our southern fishery beer would be apt to makethe harpooneer sleepy at the mast head and boozy in his boat and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford but no more enough has been said to show that the old dutchwhalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers and thatthe english whalers have not neglected so excellent an example for say they when cruising in an empty ship if you can get nothingbetter out of the world get a good dinner out of it at least and this empties the decanter chapter a bower in the arsacideshitherto in descriptively treating of the sperm whale i havechiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect or separatelyand in detail upon some few interior structural features but to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him it behoves me now to unbutton him still further and untaggingthe points of his hose unbuckling his garters and casting loosethe hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones set him before you in his ultimatum that is to say in his unconditional skeleton but how now ishmael how is it that you a mere oarsman inthe fishery pretend to know aught about the subterranean partsof the whale did erudite stubb mounted upon your capstan deliver lectures on the anatomy of the cetacea and by helpof the windlass hold up a specimen rib for exhibition explain thyself ishmael can you land a full grown whale on yourdeck for examination as a cook dishes a roast pig surely not a veritable witness have you hitherto been ishmael but have a care how you seize the privilege of jonah alone the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams the rafters ridge pole sleepers and under pinnings makingup the frame work of leviathan and belike of the tallow vats dairy rooms butteries and cheeseries in his bowels i confess that since jonah few whalemen have penetrated very farbeneath the skin of the adult whale nevertheless i have beenblessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature in a ship i belonged to a small cub sperm whale was oncebodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag to make sheathsfor the barbs of the harpoons and for the heads of the lances think you i let that chance go without using my boat hatchetand jack knife and breaking the seal and reading all the contentsof that young cub and as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathanin their gigantic full grown development for that rare knowledgei am indebted to my late royal friend tranquo king of tranque one of the arsacides for being at tranque years ago when attached to the trading ship dey of algiers i was invitedto spend part of the arsacidean holidays with the lord of tranque at his retired palm villa at pupella a sea side glen not very fardistant from what our sailors called bamboo town his capital among many other fine qualities my royal friend tranquo being gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu had brought together in pupella whatever rare things the more ingeniousof his people could invent chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices chiselled shells inlaid spears costly paddles aromatic canoes and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders the wonder freighted tribute rendering waves had cast upon his shores chief among these latter was a great sperm whale which after anunusually long raging gale had been found dead and stranded with hishead against a cocoa nut tree whose plumage like tufted droopingsseemed his verdant jet when the vast body had at last been strippedof its fathomdeep enfoldings and the bones become dust dry in the sun then the skeleton was carefully transported up the pupella glen where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it the ribs were hung with trophies the vertebrae were carvedwith arsacidean annals in strange hieroglyphics in the skull the priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame so that the mystichead again sent forth its vapory spout while suspended froma bough the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees like the hair hung sword that so affrighted damocles it was a wondrous sight the wood was green as mosses of the icy glen the trees stood high and haughty feeling their living sap the industrious earth beneath was as a weaver s loom with a gorgeous carpet on it whereof the ground vine tendrilsformed the warp and woof and the living flowers the figures all the trees with all their laden branches all the shrubs and ferns and grasses the message carrying air all theseunceasingly were active through the lacings of the leaves the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure oh busy weaver unseen weaver pause one word whither flows the fabric what palace may it deck whereforeall these ceaseless toilings speak weaver stay thy hand but one single word with thee nay the shuttle flies the figures float from forth the loom the fresher rushingcarpet for ever slides away the weaver god he weaves and by that weaving is he deafened that he hears no mortal voice and by that humming we too who look on the loom are deafened and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices thatspeak through it for even so it is in all material factories the spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles those same words are plainly heard without the walls bursting fromthe opened casements thereby have villainies been detected ah mortal then be heedful for so in all this din of the greatworld s loom thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar now amid the green life restless loom of that arsacidean wood the great white worshipped skeleton lay lounging a gigantic idler yet as the ever woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummedaround him the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver himself all wovenover with the vines every month assuming greener fresher verdure but himself a skeleton life folded death death trellised life the grim god wived with youthful life and begat him curly headed glories now when with royal tranquo i visited this wondrous whale and saw the skull an altar and the artificial smoke ascendingfrom where the real jet had issued i marvelled that the kingshould regard a chapel as an object of vertu he laughed but more i marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jetof his was genuine to and fro i paced before this skeleton brushed the vines aside broke through the ribs and with a ballof arsacidean twine wandered eddied long amid its many winding shaded colonnades and arbors but soon my line was out and following it back i emerged from the opening where i entered i saw no living thing within naught was there but bones cutting me a green measuring rod i once more dived withinthe skeleton from their arrow slit in the skull the priestsperceived me taking the altitude of the final rib how now they shouted dar st thou measure this our god that s for us aye priests well how long do ye make him then but hereupona fierce contest rose among them concerning feet and inches they cracked each other s sconces with their yard sticks the great skull echoed and seizing that lucky chance i quickly concluded my own admeasurements these admeasurements i now propose to set before you but first be it recorded that in this matter i am not freeto utter any fancied measurements i please because there areskeleton authorities you can refer to to test my accuracy there is a leviathanic museum they tell me in hull england one of the whaling ports of that country where they have somefine specimens of fin backs and other whales likewise i haveheard that in the museum of manchester in new hampshire they have what the proprietors call the only perfect specimenof a greenland or river whale in the united states moreover at aplace in yorkshire england burton constable by name a certainsir clifford constable has in his possession the skeleton of asperm whale but of moderate size by no means of the full grownmagnitude of my friend king tranquo s in both cases the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds king tranquo seizing his because he wanted it and sir clifford because he was lord of the seignories of those parts sir clifford s whale has been articulated throughout so that like a great chest of drawers you can open and shut him in all his bony cavities spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan and swing all day upon his lower jaw locks are to be putupon some of his trap doors and shutters and a footman willshow round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side sir clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whisperinggallery in the spinal column threepence to hear the echoin the hollow of his cerebellum and sixpence for the unrivalledview from his forehead the skeleton dimensions i shall now proceed to set down arecopied verbatim from my right arm where i had them tattooed as in my wild wanderings at that period there was noother secure way of preserving such valuable statistics but as i was crowded for space and wished the other parts of mybody to remain a blank page for a poem i was then composing at least what untattooed parts might remain i did not troublemyself with the odd inches nor indeed should inches at allenter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale chapter measurement of the whale s skeletonin the first place i wish to lay before you a particular plain statement touching the living bulk of this leviathan whose skeleton we are briefly to exhibit such a statementmay prove useful here according to a careful calculation i have made and which ipartly base upon captain scoresby s estimate of seventy tonsfor the largest sized greenland whale of sixty feet in length according to my careful calculation i say a sperm whale of thelargest magnitude between eighty five and ninety feet in length and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons so that reckoning thirteen men to a ton he would considerably outweighthe combined population of a whole village of one thousandone hundred inhabitants think you not then that brains like yoked cattle should be put tothis leviathan to make him at all budge to any landsman s imagination having already in various ways put before you his skull spout hole jaw teeth tail forehead fins and divers other parts i shall now simply point out what is most interesting in thegeneral bulk of his unobstructed bones but as the colossalskull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extentof the skeleton as it is by far the most complicated part and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter you must not fail to carry it in your mind or under your arm as we proceed otherwise you will not gain a complete notionof the general structure we are about to view in length the sperm whale s skeleton at tranque measuredseventy two feet so that when fully invested and extended in life he must have been ninety feet long for in the whale the skeletonloses about one fifth in length compared with the living body of this seventy two feet his skull and jaw comprised sometwenty feet leaving some fifty feet of plain backbone attached to this back bone for something less than a thirdof its length was the mighty circular basket of ribs which onceenclosed his vitals to me this vast ivory ribbed chest with the long unrelieved spine extending far away from it in a straight line not a little resembledthe hull of a great ship new laid upon the stocks when only sometwenty of her naked bow ribs are inserted and the keel is otherwise for the time but a long disconnected timber the ribs were ten on a side the first to begin from the neck was nearly six feet long the second third and fourth were eachsuccessively longer till you came to the climax of the fifth or one of the middle ribs which measured eight feet andsome inches from that part the remaining ribs diminished till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches in general thickness they all bore a seemly correspondenceto their length the middle ribs were the most arched in some of the arsacides they are used for beams whereon to layfootpath bridges over small streams in considering these ribs i could not but be struck anew withthe circumstance so variously repeated in this book that the skeletonof the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form the largest of the tranque ribs one of the middle ones occupied that part of the fish which in life is greatestin depth now the greatest depth of the invested body of thisparticular whale must have been at least sixteen feet whereas the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet so that this rib only conveyed half of the true notionof the living magnitude of that part besides for some way where i now saw but a naked spine all that had been once wrappedround with tons of added bulk in flesh muscle blood and bowels still more for the ample fins i here saw but a few disordered joints and in place of the weighty and majestic but boneless flukes an utter blank how vain and foolish then thought i for timid untravelled manto try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale by merely poringover his dead attenuated skeleton stretched in this peaceful wood no only in the heart of quickest perils only when withinthe eddyings of his angry flukes only on the profound unbounded sea can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out but the spine for that the best way we can consider it is with a crane to pile its bones high up on end no speedy enterprise but now it s done it looks much like pompey s pillar there are forty and odd vertebrae in all which in the skeletonare not locked together they mostly lie like the great knobbedblocks on a gothic spire forming solid courses of heavy masonry the largest a middle one is in width something less than three feet and in depth more than four the smallest where the spine tapersaway into the tail is only two inches in width and looks somethinglike a white billiard ball i was told that there were stillsmaller ones but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins the priest s children who had stolen them to play marbles with thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living thingstapers off at last into simple child s play chapter the fossil whalefrom his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial themewhereon to enlarge amplify and generally expatiate would you you could not compress him by good rights he should only betreated of in imperial folio not to tell over again his furlongsfrom spiracle to tail and the yards he measures about the waist only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled awayin the subterranean orlop deck of a line of battle ship since i have undertaken to manhandle this leviathan it behovesme to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise not overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels having already described him in most of his present habitatoryand anatomical peculiarities it now remains to magnify him inan archaeological fossiliferous and antediluvian point of view applied to any other creature than the leviathan to an ant or a flea such portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent but when leviathan is the text the case is altered fain am i to staggerto this enterprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary and here be it said that whenever it has been convenient to consultone in the course of these dissertations i have invariably used a hugequarto edition of johnson expressly purchased for that purpose because that famous lexicographer s uncommon personal bulk more fittedhim to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me one often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject though it may seem but an ordinary one how then with me writing of this leviathan unconsciously my chirographyexpands into placard capitals give me a condor s quill give me vesuvius crater for an inkstand friends hold my arms for in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this leviathan they weary me and make me faint with their outreachingcomprehensiveness of sweep as if to include the whole circleof the sciences and all the generations of whales and men and mastodons past present and to come with all the revolvingpanoramas of empire on earth and throughout the whole universe not excluding its suburbs such and so magnifying is thevirtue of a large and liberal theme we expand to its bulk to produce a mighty book you must choose a mighty theme no great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea though many there be who have tried it ere entering upon the subject of fossil whales i present mycredentials as a geologist by stating that in my miscellaneoustime i have been a stone mason and also a great digger of ditches canals and wells wine vaults cellars and cisterns of all sorts likewise by way of preliminary i desire to remind the reader that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossilsof monsters now almost completely extinct the subsequent relicsdiscovered in what are called the tertiary formations seem the connecting or at any rate intercepted links between the antichronical creatures and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered the ark all the fossil whales hitherto discovered belong to the tertiary period which is the last preceding the superficial formations and thoughnone of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects to justifytheir taking ranks as cetacean fossils detached broken fossils of pre adamite whales fragments of their bonesand skeletons have within thirty years past at various intervals been found at the base of the alps in lombardy in france in england in scotland and in the states of louisiana mississippi and alabama among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull which in the year was disinterred in the rue dauphine in paris a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of the tuileries and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of antwerp in napoleon s time cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belongedto some utterly unknown leviathanic species but by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almostcomplete vast skeleton of an extinct monster found in the year on the plantation of judge creagh in alabama the awe stricken credulousslaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels the alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile and bestowed upon itthe name of basilosaurus but some specimen bones of it being takenacross the sea to owen the english anatomist it turned out that thisalleged reptile was a whale though of a departed species a significantillustration of the fact again and again repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shapeof his fully invested body so owen rechristened the monster zeuglodon and in his paper read before the london geological society pronounced it in substance one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutationsof the globe have blotted out of existence when i stand among these mighty leviathan skeletons skulls tusks jaws ribs and vertebrae all characterizedby partial resemblances to the existing breeds of sea monsters but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities tothe annihilated antichronical leviathans their incalculable seniors i am by a flood borne back to that wondrous period ere timeitself can be said to have begun for time began with man here saturn s grey chaos rolls over me and i obtain dim shuddering glimpses into those polar eternities when wedgedbastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the tropics and in all the miles of this world s circumference not an inhabitable hand s breadth of land was visible then the whole world was the whale s and king of creation he left his wake along the present lines of the andes andthe himmalehs who can show a pedigree like leviathan ahab s harpoonhad shed older blood than the pharaoh s methuselah seems a schoolboy i look round to shake hands with shem i am horror struckat this antemosaic unsourced existence of the unspeakableterrors of the whale which having been before all time must needs exist after all humane ages are over but not alone has this leviathan left his pre adamite traces in thestereotype plates of nature and in limestone and marl bequeathed hisancient bust but upon egyptian tablets whose antiquity seems to claimfor them an almost fossiliferous character we find the unmistakable printof his fin in an apartment of the great temple of denderah some fiftyyears ago there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculpturedand painted planisphere abounding in centaurs griffins and dolphins similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns gliding among them old leviathan swam as of yore was there swimmingin that planisphere centuries before solomon was cradled nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquityof the whale in his own osseous postdiluvian reality as set downby the venerable john leo the old barbary traveller not far from the sea side they have a temple the raftersand beams of which are made of whale bones for whales of amonstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore the common people imagine that by a secret power bestowed by godupon the temple no whale can pass it without immediate death but the truth of the matter is that on either sideof the temple there are rocks that shoot two miles intothe sea and wound the whales when they light upon em they keep a whale s rib of an incredible length for a miracle which lying upon the ground with its convex part uppermost makes an arch the head of which cannot be reachedby a man upon a camel s back this rib says john leo is said to have layn there a hundred years before i saw it their historians affirm that a prophet who prophesy d of mahomet came from this temple and some do not stand to assert that the prophet jonas was cast forth by the whale at the baseof the temple in this afric temple of the whale i leave you reader and if yoube a nantucketer and a whaleman you will silently worship there chapter does the whale s magnitude diminish will he perish inasmuch then as this leviathan comes floundering downupon us from the head waters of the eternities it may befitly inquired whether in the long course of his generations he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his sires but upon investigation we find that not only are the whalesof the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossilremains are found in the tertiary system embracing a distinctgeological period prior to man but of the whales found inthat tertiary system those belonging to its latter formationsexceed in size those of its earlier ones of all the pre adamite whales yet exhumed by far the largestis the alabama one mentioned in the last chapter and thatwas less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton whereas we have already seen that the tape measure givesseventy two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale and i have heard on whalemen s authority that sperm whales havebeen captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture but may it not be that while the whales of the present hour are anadvance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods may it not be that since adam s time they have degenerated assuredly we must conclude so if we are to credit the accountsof such gentlemen as pliny and the ancient naturalists generally for pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk and aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length rope walks and thames tunnels of whales and even in the daysof banks and solander cooke s naturalists we find a danish memberof the academy of sciences setting down certain iceland whales reydan siskur or wrinkled bellies at one hundred and twenty yards that is three hundred and sixty feet and lacepede the french naturalist in his elaborate history of whales in the very beginning of his work page sets down the right whaleat one hundred metres three hundred and twenty eight feet and this work was published so late as a d but will any whaleman believe these stories no the whaleof to day is as big as his ancestors in pliny s time and if ever i go where pliny is i a whaleman more than he was will make bold to tell him so because i cannot understandhow it is that while the egyptian mummies that were buriedthousands of years before even pliny was born do not measureso much in their coffins as a modern kentuckian in his socks and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldestegyptian and nineveh tablets by the relative proportions inwhich they are drawn just as plainly prove that the high bred stall fed prize cattle of smithfield not only equal but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of pharaoh s fat kine in the face of all this i will not admit that of all animalsthe whale alone should have degenerated but still another inquiry remains one often agitated by the morerecondite nantucketers whether owing to the almost omniscientlook outs at the mast heads of the whaleships now penetratingeven through behring s straits and into the remotest secret drawersand lockers of the world and the thousand harpoons and lances dartedalong all continental coasts the moot point is whether leviathancan long endure so wide a chase and so remorseless a havoc whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters and the last whale like the last man smoke his last pipe and then himself evaporate in the final puff comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo which not forty years ago overspread by tens of thousands the prairiesof illinois and missouri and shook their iron manes and scowled withtheir thunder clotted brows upon the sites of populous river capitals where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction but you must look at this matter in every light though so shorta period ago not a good lifetime the census of the buffalo in illinoisexceeded the census of men now in london and though at the presentday not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spearof man yet the far different nature of the whale hunt peremptorilyforbids so inglorious an end to the leviathan forty men in oneship hunting the sperm whales for forty eight months think theyhave done extremely well and thank god if at last they carry homethe oil of forty fish whereas in the days of the old canadianand indian hunters and trappers of the west when the far west in whose sunset suns still rise was a wilderness and a virgin the same number of moccasined men for the same number of months mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships would have slainnot forty but forty thousand and more buffaloes a fact that if need were could be statistically stated nor considered aright does it seem any argument in favorof the gradual extinction of the sperm whale for example that in former years the latter part of the last century say these leviathans in small pods were encountered muchoftener than at present and in consequence the voyageswere not so prolonged and were also much more remunerative because as has been elsewhere noticed those whales influenced bysome views to safety now swim the seas in immense caravans so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries yokes and pods and schools of other days are now aggregated intovast but widely separated unfrequent armies that is all and equally fallacious seems the conceit that because the so calledwhale bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former yearsabounding with them hence that species also is declining for they are only being driven from promontory to cape and ifone coast is no longer enlivened with their jets then be sure some other and remoter strand has been very recently startledby the unfamiliar spectacle furthermore concerning these last mentioned leviathans they have two firm fortresses which in all human probability will for ever remain impregnable and as upon the invasion oftheir valleys the frosty swiss have retreated to their mountains so hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas the whale bone whales can at last resort to their polar citadels and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there come up among icy fields and floes and in a charmed circleof everlasting december bid defiance to all pursuit from man but as perhaps fifty of these whale bone whales are harpoonedfor one cachalot some philosophers of the forecastle haveconcluded that this positive havoc has already very seriouslydiminished their battalions but though for some time pasta number of these whales not less than have beenannually slain on the nor west coast by the americans alone yet there are considerations which render even this circumstanceof little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousnessof the more enormous creatures of the globe yet what shall wesay to harto the historian of goa when he tells us that at onehunting the king of siam took elephants that in those regionselephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes and there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants which have now been hunted for thousands of years by semiramis by porus by hannibal and by all the successive monarchs of the east if they still survive there in great numbers much more maythe great whale outlast all hunting since he has a pastureto expatiate in which is precisely twice as large as all asia both americas europe and africa new holland and all the islesof the sea combined moreover we are to consider that from the presumed great longevityof whales their probably attaining the age of a century and more therefore at any one period of time several distinct adultgenerations must be contemporary and what this is we may soongain some idea of by imagining all the grave yards cemeteries and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of allthe men women and children who were alive seventy five years ago and adding this countless host to the present human populationof the globe wherefore for all these things we account the whale immortalin his species however perishable in his individuality he swam the seas before the continents broke water he onceswam over the site of the tuileries and windsor castle and the kremlin in noah s flood he despised noah s ark and if ever the world is to be again flooded like the netherlands to kill off its rats then the eternal whale will still survive and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood spout his frothed defiance to the skies chapter ahab s legthe precipitating manner in which captain ahab had quittedthe samuel enderby of london had not been unattended with some smallviolence to his own person he had lighted with such energy upon a thwartof his boat that his ivory leg had received a half splintering shock and when after gaining his own deck and his own pivot hole there he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman it was as ever something about his not steering inflexibly enough then the already shaken ivory received such an additional twistand wrench that though it still remained entire and to allappearances lusty yet ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy and indeed it seemed small matter for wonder that for allhis pervading mad recklessness ahab did at times give carefulheed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood for it had not been very long prior to the pequod s sailingfrom nantucket that he had been found one night lying prone uponthe ground and insensible by some unknown and seemingly inexplicable unimaginable casualty his ivory limb having been so violently displaced that it had stake wise smitten and all but pierced his groin nor was it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing woundwas entirely cured nor at the time had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but thedirect issue of a former woe and he too plainly seemed to see that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuateshis kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove so equally with every felicity all miserable events do naturallybeget their like yea more than equally thought ahab since both the ancestry and posterity of grief go further thanthe ancestry and posterity of joy for not to hint of this that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings that whilesome natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to themfor the other world but on the contrary shall be followed bythe joy childlessness of all hell s despair whereas some guiltymortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselvesan eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave not at all to hint of this there still seems an inequalityin the deeper analysis of the thing for thought ahab while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certainunsignifying pettiness lurking in them but at bottom all heartwoes a mystic significance and in some men an archangelic grandeur so do their diligent tracings out not belie the obvious deduction to trail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the gods so that in the face of all the glad hay making suns and softcymballing round harvest moons we must needs givein to this that the gods themselves are not for ever glad the ineffaceable sad birth mark in the brow of man is butthe stamp of sorrow in the signers unwittingly here a secret has been divulged which perhapsmight more properly in set way have been disclosed before with many other particulars concerning ahab always had it remaineda mystery to some why it was that for a certain period both beforeand after the sailing of the pequod he had hidden himself awaywith such grand lama like exclusiveness and for that one interval sought speechless refuge as it were among the marble senateof the dead captain peleg s bruited reason for this thing appearedby no means adequate though indeed as touching all ahab sdeeper part every revelation partook more of significant darknessthan of explanatory light but in the end it all came out this one matter did at least that direful mishap was at the bottomof his temporary recluseness and not only this but to thatever contracting dropping circle ashore who for any reason possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him to that timid circle the above hinted casualty remaining as it did moodily unaccounted for by ahab invested itself with terrors not entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails so that through their zeal for him they had all conspired so faras in them lay to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others and hence it was that not till a considerable interval had elapsed did it transpire upon the pequod s decks but be all this as it may let the unseen ambiguous synodin the air or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire have to do or not with earthly ahab yet in this presentmatter of his leg he took plain practical procedures he called the carpenter and when that functionary appeared before him he bade him withoutdelay set about making a new leg and directed the mates to see himsupplied with all the studs and joists of jaw ivory sperm whale which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage in order that a carefulselection of the stoutest clearest grained stuff might be secured this done the carpenter received orders to have the legcompleted that night and to provide all the fittings for it independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use moreover the ship s forge was ordered to be hoisted out of itstemporary idleness in the hold and to accelerate the affair the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forgingof whatever iron contrivances might be needed chapter the carpenterseat thyself sultanically among the moons of saturn and takehigh abstracted man alone and he seems a wonder a grandeur and a woe but from the same point take mankind in mass and for the most part they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates both contemporary and hereditary but most humble though he was and far from furnishing an example of the high humane abstraction the pequod s carpenter was no duplicate hence he now comesin person on this stage like all sea going ship carpenters and more especially those belongingto whaling vessels he was to a certain off hand practical extent alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own the carpenter s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunkof all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to dowith wood as an auxiliary material but besides the applicationto him of the generic remark above this carpenter of the pequodwas singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanicalemergencies continually recurring in a large ship upon a threeor four years voyage in uncivilized and far distant seas for not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties repairing stove boats sprung spars reforming the shape ofclumsy bladed oars inserting bull s eyes in the deck or newtree nails in the side planks and other miscellaneous mattersmore directly pertaining to his special business he was moreoverunhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes both useful and capricious the one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold was his vice bench a long rude ponderous table furnished withseveral vices of different sizes and both of iron and of wood at all times except when whales were alongside this bench was securelylashed athwartships against the rear of the try works a belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole the carpenter claps it into one of his ever ready vices and straightway files it smaller a lost landbird of strangeplumage strays on board and is made a captive out of clean shavedrods of right whale bone and cross beams

another has the toothache the carpenter out pincers and clapping one hand upon his benchbids him be seated there but the poor fellow unmanageably wincesunder the unconcluded operation whirling round the handle of hiswooden vice the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that if he would have him draw the tooth thus this carpenter was prepared at all points and alike indifferentand without respect in all teeth he accounted bits of ivory heads he deemed but top blocks men themselves he lightly heldfor capstans but while now upon so wide a field thus variouslyaccomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him too all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence but not precisely so for nothing was this man more remarkable than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were impersonal i say for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the wholevisible world which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes still eternally holds its peace and ignores you though you digfoundations for cathedrals yet was this half horrible stolidityin him involving too as it appeared an all ramifying heartlessness yet was it oddly dashed at times with an old crutch like antediluvian wheezing humorousness not unstreaked now and then with a certaingrizzled wittiness such as might have served to pass the timeduring the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of noah s ark was it that this old carpenter had been a life long wanderer whose much rolling to and fro not only had gathered no moss but what is more had rubbed off whatever small outward clingingsmight have originally pertained to him he was a stript abstract an unfractioned integral uncompromised as a new born babe living without premeditated reference to this world or the next you might almost say that this strange uncompromisedness in him involveda sort of unintelligence for in his numerous trades he did not seemto work so much by reason or by instinct or simply because he had beentutored to it or by any intermixture of all these even or uneven but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb spontaneous literal process he was a pure manipulator his brain if he had ever had one must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers he was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful multum in parvo sheffield contrivances assuming the exterior though a little swelled of a common pocket knife but containing not only blades of various sizes but also screw drivers cork screws tweezers awls pens rulers nail filers countersinkers so if his superiors wanted to use the carpenter for a screw driver all they had to do was to open that part of him and the screw was fast or if for tweezers take him up by the legs and there they were yet as previously hinted this omnitooled open and shut carpenter was after all no mere machine of an automaton if he did nothave a common soul in him he had a subtle something that somehowanomalously did its duty what that was whether essence of quicksilver or a few drops of hartshorn there is no telling but there it was and there it had abided for now some sixty years or more and this it was this same unaccountable cunning life principle in him this it was that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing but only like an unreasoning wheel which also hummingly soliloquizes or rather his body was a sentry box and this soliloquizer on guard there and talking all the time to keep himself awake chapter ahab and the carpenterthe deck first night watch carpenter

somebody else that s certain ahab advancing during the ensuing scene the carpenter continues sneezing at times well manmaker just in time sir if the captain pleases i will now mark the length let me measure sir measured for a leg good well it s not the first time about it there keep thy finger on it this is a cogentvice thou hast here carpenter let me feel its grip once so so it does pinch some oh sir it will break bones beware beware no fear i like a good grip i like to feel something in thisslippery world that can hold man what s prometheus about there the blacksmith i mean what s he about he must be forging the buckle screw sir now right it s a partnership he supplies the muscle part he makes a fierce red flame there aye sir he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work um m so he must i do deem it now a most meaning thing that that old greek prometheus who made men they say should havebeen a blacksmith and animated them with fire for what s madein fire must properly belong to fire and so hell s probable how the soot flies this must be the remainder the greek madethe africans of carpenter when he s through with that buckle tell him to forge a pair of steel

my turn what art thou thrusting that thief catcher into my face for man thrusted light is worse than presented pistols i thought sir that you spoke to carpenter carpenter why that s but no a very tidy and i may say an extremelygentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here carpenter or would stthou rather work in clay sir clay clay sir that s mud we leave clay to ditchers sir the fellow s impious what art thou sneezing about bone is rather dusty sir take the hint then and when thou art dead never bury thyselfunder living people s noses sir oh ah i guess so so yes yes oh dear look ye carpenter i dare say thou callest thyself a right goodworkmanlike workman eh well then will it speak thoroughly wellfor thy work if when i come to mount this leg thou makest i shallnevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it that is carpenter my old lost leg the flesh and blood one i mean canst thou not drive that old adam away truly sir i begin to understand somewhat now yes i have heard something curious on that score sir how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feelingof his old spar but it will be still pricking him at times may i humbly ask if it be really so sir it is man look put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was so now here is only one distinct leg to the eye yet two to the soul where thou feelest tingling life there exactly there there to a hair do i is t a riddle i should humbly call it a poser sir hist then how dost thou know that some entire living thinking thingmay not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing preciselywhere thou now standest aye and standing there in thy spite in thy most solitary hours then dost thou not fear eavesdroppers hold don t speak and if i still feel the smart of my crushed leg though it be now so long dissolved then why mayest not thou carpenter feel the fiery pains of hell for ever and without a body hah good lord truly sir if it comes to that i must calculate over again i think i didn t carry a small figure sir look ye pudding heads should never grant premises how longbefore this leg is done perhaps an hour sir bungle away at it then and bring it to me turns to go oh life here i am

oil came up with the water the casks below must have sprung a bad leak much concernwas shown and starbuck went down into the cabin to reportthis unfavorable affair in sperm whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board it is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold and drench the casks with sea water which afterwards at varying intervals is removed by the ship s pumps hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight while bythe changed character of the withdrawn water the marinersreadily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo now from the south and west the pequod was drawing nigh to formosaand the bashee isles between which lies one of the tropical outletsfrom the china waters into the pacific and so starbuck found ahabwith a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him and another separate one representing the long eastern coastsof the japanese islands niphon matsmai and sikoke with hissnow white new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table and with a long pruning hook of a jack knife in his hand the wondrousold man with his back to the gangway door was wrinkling his brow and tracing his old courses again who s there hearing the footstep at the door but not turninground to it on deck begone captain ahab mistakes it is i the oil in the hold is leaking sir we must up burtons and break out up burtons and break out now that we are nearing japan heave to here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops either do that sir or waste in one day more oil than wemay make good in a year what we come twenty thousand milesto get is worth saving sir so it is so it is if we get it i was speaking of the oil in the hold sir and i was not speaking or thinking of that at all begone let it leak i m all aleak myself aye leaks in leaks not only full of leaky casks but those leaky casks are in aleaky ship and that s a far worse plight than the pequod s man yet i don t stop to plug my leak for who can find it inthe deep loaded hull or how hope to plug it even if found in this life s howling gale starbuck i ll not havethe burtons hoisted what will the owners say sir let the owners stand on nantucket beach and outyellthe typhoons what cares ahab owners owners thou artalways prating to me starbuck about those miserly owners as if the owners were my conscience but look ye the only realowner of anything is its commander and hark ye my conscienceis in this ship s keel on deck captain ahab said the reddening mate moving further into the cabin with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemednot only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestationof itself but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself a better man than i might well pass over in thee what he would quicklyenough resent in a younger man aye and in a happier captain ahab devils dost thou then so much as dare to critically thinkof me on deck nay sir not yet i do entreat and i do dare sir to be forbearing shall we not understand each other better than hitherto captain ahab ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack forming part of mostsouth sea men s cabin furniture and pointing it towardsstarbuck exclaimed there is one god that is lord over the earth and one captain that is lord over the pequod on deck for an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate and his fiery cheeks you would have almost thought that he had really received the blazeof the levelled tube but mastering his emotion he half calmly rose and as he quitted the cabin paused for an instant and said thou hast outraged not insulted me sir but for that i ask thee not tobeware of starbuck thou wouldst but laugh but let ahab beware of ahab beware of thyself old man he waxes brave but nevertheless obeys most carefulbravery that murmured ahab as starbuck disappeared what s that he said ahab beware of ahab there s something there then unconsciously using the musket for a staff with an ironbrow he paced to and fro in the little cabin but presentlythe thick plaits of his forehead relaxed and returning the gunto the rack he went to the deck thou art but too good a fellow starbuck he said lowly to the mate then raising his voice to the crew furl the t gallant sails and close reef the top sails fore and aft back the main yard up burtons and break out in the main hold it were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was that as respectingstarbuck ahab thus acted it may have been a flash of honestyin him or mere prudential policy which under the circumstance imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection however transient in the important chief officer of his ship however it was his orders were executed and the burtons were hoisted chapter queequeg in his coffinupon searching it was found that the casks last struck into the holdwere perfectly sound and that the leak must be further off so it being calm weather they broke out deeper and deeper disturbing the slumbers of the huge ground tier butts and from that black midnight sending those gigantic molesinto the daylight above so deep did they go and so ancient and corroded and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner stone caskcontaining coins of captain noah with copies of the posted placards vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood tierce after tierce too of water and bread and beef and shooks of staves and iron bundles of hoops were hoisted out till at last the piled decks were hard to get about and the hollowhull echoed under foot as if you were treading over empty catacombs and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air freighted demijohn top heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all aristotlein his head well was it that the typhoons did not visit them then now at this time it was that my poor pagan companion and fast bosom friend queequeg was seized with a fever which brought him nigh to his endless end be it said that in this vocation of whaling sinecures are unknown dignity and danger go hand in hand till you get to be captain the higher you rise the harder you toil so with poor queequeg who as harpooneer must not only face all the rage of theliving whale but as we have elsewhere seen mount his dead backin a rolling sea and finally descend into the gloom of the hold and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous confinement resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and see to their stowage to be short among whalemen the harpooneers are the holders so called poor queequeg when the ship was about half disembowelled you should have stooped over the hatchway and peered downupon him there where stripped to his woollen drawers the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampnessand slime like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well and a well or an ice house it somehow proved to him poor pagan where strange to say for all the heat of his sweatings he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever and at last after some days suffering laid him in his hammock close to the very sill of the door of death how he wastedand wasted away in those few long lingering days till thereseemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing but as all else in him thinned and his cheek bones grew sharper his eyes nevertheless seemed growing fuller and fuller they became of a strange softness of lustre and mildly butdeeply looked out at you there from his sickness a wondroustestimony to that immortal health in him which could not die or be weakened and like circles on the water which as theygrow fainter expand so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding like the rings of eternity an awe that cannot be named wouldsteal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage and saw as strange things in his face as any beheld who werebystanders when zoroaster died for whatever is truly wondrousand fearful in man never yet was put into words or books and the drawing near of death which alike levels all alike impresses all with a last revelation which only an authorfrom the dead could adequately tell so that let us say it again no dying chaldee or greek had higher and holier thoughtsthan those whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the faceof poor queequeg as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest and the ocean s invisible flood tide lifted him higher and highertowards his destined heaven not a man of the crew but gave him up and as for queequeg himself what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curiousfavor he asked he called one to him in the grey morning watch when the day was just breaking and taking his hand said that while in nantucket he had chanced to see certain littlecanoes of dark wood like the rich war wood of his native isle and upon inquiry he had learned that all whalemen who diedin nantucket were laid in those same dark canoes and that the fancyof being so laid had much pleased him for it was not unlikethe custom of his own race who after embalming a dead warrior stretched him out in his canoe and so left him to be floatedaway to the starry archipelagoes for not only do they believethat the stars are isles but that far beyond all visible horizons their own mild uncontinented seas interflow with the blue heavens and so form the white breakers of the milky way he added that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock according to the usual sea custom tossed like something vileto the death devouring sharks no he desired a canoe like thoseof nantucket all the more congenial to him being a whaleman that like a whale boat these coffin canoes were without a keel though that involved but uncertain steering and much lee wayadown the dim ages now when this strange circumstance was made known aft the carpenter was at once commanded to do queequeg s bidding whatever it might include there was some heathenish coffin colored old lumber aboard which upon a long previous voyage had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the lackaday islands and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made no sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order than takinghis rule he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitudeof his character proceeded into the forecastle and tookqueequeg s measure with great accuracy regularly chalkingqueequeg s person as he shifted the rule ah poor fellow he ll have to die now ejaculated thelong island sailor going to his vice bench the carpenter for convenience sakeand general reference now transferringly measured on itthe exact length the coffin was to be and then made the transferpermanent by cutting two notches at its extremities this done he marshalled the planks and his tools and to work when the last nail was driven and the lid duly planed and fitted he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction overhearing the indignant but half humorous cries with whichthe people on deck began to drive the coffin away queequeg to every one s consternation commanded that the thing shouldbe instantly brought to him nor was there any denying him seeing that of all mortals some dying men are the most tyrannical and certainly since they will shortly trouble us so littlefor evermore the poor fellows ought to be indulged leaning over in his hammock queequeg long regarded the coffinwith an attentive eye he then called for his harpoon had the wooden stock drawn from it and then had the iron partplaced in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat all by his own request also biscuits were then ranged roundthe sides within a flask of fresh water was placed at the head and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot and a piece of sail cloth being rolled up for a pillow queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed that he might make trial of its comforts if any it had he lay without moving a few minutes then told one to goto his bag and bring out his little god yojo then crossinghis arms on his breast with yojo between he called forthe coffin lid hatch he called it to be placed over him the head part turned over with a leather hinge and there layqueequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenancein view rarmai it will do it is easy he murmured at last and signed to be replaced in his hammock but ere this was done pip who had been slily hovering near by allthe while drew nigh to him where he lay and with soft sobbings took him by the hand in the other holding his tambourine poor rover will ye never have done with all this weary roving where go ye now but if the currents carry ye to those sweet antilleswhere the beaches are only beat with water lilies will ye do onelittle errand for me seek out one pip who s now been missing long i think he s in those far antilles if ye find him then comfort him for he must be very sad for look he s left his tambourine behind i found it rig a dig dig dig now queequeg die and i ll beatye your dying march i have heard murmured starbuck gazing down the scuttle that inviolent fevers men all ignorance have talked in ancient tongues and that when the mystery is probed it turns out alwaysthat in their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongueshad been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars so to my fond faith poor pip in this strange sweetness ofhis lunacy brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes where learned he that but there hark he speaks again but more wildly now form two and two let s make a general of him ho where shis harpoon lay it across here rig a dig dig dig huzza oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow queequeg dies game mind ye that queequeg dies game take ye good heed of that queequeg dies game i say game game game but base little pip he died a coward died all a shiver out upon pip hark ye if ye find pip tell all the antilles he s a runaway a coward a coward a coward tell them he jumped from a whale boat i d neverbeat my tambourine over base pip and hail him general if he were once more dying here no no shame upon all cowards shame upon them let em go drown like pip that jumped froma whale boat shame shame during all this queequeg lay with closed eyes as if in a dream pip was led away and the sick man was replaced in his hammock but now that he had apparently made every preparation for death now that his coffin was proved a good fit queequeg suddenly rallied soon there seemed no need of the carpenter s box and thereupon when some expressed their delighted surprise he in substance said that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this at a critical moment he had just recalled a little duty ashore which hewas leaving undone and therefore had changed his mind about dying he could not die yet he averred they asked him then whether tolive or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure he answered certainly in a word it was queequeg s conceit that if a man made up his mind to live mere sickness could not kill him nothing but a whale or a gale or some violent ungovernable unintelligent destroyer of that sort now there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized that while a sick civilized man may be six months convalescing generally speaking a sick savage is almost half well againin a day so in good time my queequeg gained strength and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days but eating with a vigorous appetite he suddenly leaped to his feet threw out his arms and legs gave himself a good stretching yawned alittle bit and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat and poising a harpoon pronounced himself fit for a fight with a wild whimsiness he now used his coffin for a sea chest and emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes set them in order there many spare hours he spent in carving the lid with all manner of grotesquefigures and drawings and it seemed that hereby he was striving in his rude way to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body and this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seerof his island who by those hieroglyphic marks had writtenout on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth so that queequegin his own proper person was a riddle to unfold a wondrous workin one volume but whose mysteries not even himself could read though his own live heart beat against them and these mysterieswere therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the livingparchment whereon they were inscribed and so be unsolved to the last and this thought it must have been which suggested to ahab that wildexclamation of his when one morning turning away from surveying poorqueequeg oh devilish tantalization of the gods chapter the pacificwhen gliding by the bashee isles we emerged at last upon the greatsouth sea were it not for other things i could have greeted my dearpacific with uncounted thanks for now the long supplication of my youthwas answered that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousandleagues of blue there is one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea whose gently awful stirrings seems to speak of some hidden soul beneath like those fabled undulations of the ephesian sod over the buriedevangelist st john and meet it is that over these sea pastures wide rolling watery prairies and potters fields of all four continents the waves should rise and fall and ebb and flow unceasingly for here millions of mixed shades and shadows drowned dreams somnambulisms reveries all that we call lives and souls lie dreaming dreaming still tossing like slumberers in their beds the ever rolling waves but made so by their restlessness to any meditative magian rover this serene pacific once beheld must ever after be the sea of his adoption it rolls the midmostwaters of the world the indian ocean and atlantic being but its arms the same waves wash the moles of the new built california towns but yesterday planted by the recentest

impenetrable japans thus this mysterious divine pacific zones the world s whole bulk about makes allcoasts one bay to it seems the tide beating heart of earth lifted by those eternal swells you needs must own the seductive god bowing your head to pan but few thoughts of pan stirred ahab s brain as standing like an ironstatue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging with onenostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the bashee isles in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking and withthe other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea that sea in which the hated white whale must even then be swimming launched at length upon these almost final waters and glidingtowards the japanese cruising ground the old man s purposeintensified itself his firm lips met like the lips of a vice the delta of his forehead s veins swelled like overladen brooks in his very sleep his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull stern all the white whale spouts thick blood chapter the blacksmithavailing himself of the mild summer cool weather that now reignedin these latitudes and in preparation for the peculiarly activepursuits shortly to be anticipated perth the begrimed blisteredold blacksmith had not removed his portable forge to the hold again after concluding his contributory work for ahab s leg but stillretained it on deck fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen and harpooneers and bowsmen to do some little job for them altering or repairing or new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture often he would be surrounded by an eager circle all waitingto be served holding boat spades pikeheads harpoons and lances and jealously watching his every sooty movement as he toiled nevertheless this old man s was a patient hammer wielded by apatient arm no murmur no impatience no petulance did comefrom him silent slow and solemn bowing over still further hischronically broken back he toiled away as if toil were life itself and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart and so it was most miserable a peculiar walk in this old man a certain slight but painfulappearing yawing in his gait had at an early period of the voyageexcited the curiosity of the mariners and to the importunityof their persisted questionings he had finally given in and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shamefulstory of his wretched fate belated and not innocently one bitter winter s midnight on the road running between two country towns the blacksmithhalf stupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him and sought refuge in a leaning dilapidated barn the issue was the loss of the extremities of both feet out of this revelation part by part at last came out the fouracts of the gladness and the one long and as yet uncatastrophiedfifth act of the grief of his life s drama he was an old man who at the age of nearly sixty had postponedlyencountered that thing in sorrow s technicals called ruin he had been an artisan of famed excellence and with plentyto do owned a house and garden embraced a youthful daughter like loving wife and three blithe ruddy children every sunday went to a cheerful looking church planted in a grove but one night under cover of darkness and further concealedin a most cunning disguisement a desperate burglar slidinto his happy home and robbed them all of everything and darker yet to tell the blacksmith himself didignorantly conduct this burglar into his family s heart it was the bottle conjuror upon the opening of that fatal cork forth flew the fiend and shrivelled up his home now for prudent most wise and economic reasons the blacksmith s shop was inthe basement of his dwelling but with a separate entrance to it so that always had the young and loving healthy wife listenedwith no unhappy nervousness but with vigorous pleasure to the stout ringing of her young armed old husband s hammer whose reverberations muffled by passing through the floorsand walls came up to her not unsweetly in her nursery and so to stout labor s iron lullaby the blacksmith s infantswere rocked to slumber oh woe on woe oh death why canst thou not sometimes be timely hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruincame upon him then had the young widow had a delicious grief and her orphans a truly venerable legendary sire to dream of intheir after years and all of them a care killing competency but death plucked down some virtuous elder brother on whose whistlingdaily toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family and left the worse than useless old man standing till the hideousrot of life should make him easier to harvest why tell the whole the blows of the basement hammer every daygrew more and

vagabond in crape his everywoe unreverenced his grey head a scorn to flaxen curls death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this but death is only a launching into the region of the

forgewith matted beard and swathed in a bristling shark skin apron about mid day perth was standing between his forge and anvil the latter placed upon an iron wood log with one hand holding a pike headin the coals and with the other at his forge s lungs when captain ahabcame along carrying in his hand a small rusty looking leathern bag while yet a little distance from the forge moody ahab paused till at last perth withdrawing his iron from the fire began hammeringit upon the anvil the red mass sending off the sparks in thickhovering flights some of which flew close to ahab are these thy mother carey s chickens perth they are always flyingin thy wake birds of good omen too but not to all look here they burn but thou thou liv st among them without a scorch because i am scorched all over captain ahab answered perth resting for a moment on his hammer i am past scorching not easily can st thou scorch a scar well well no more thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly sanely woefulto me in no paradise myself i am impatient of all misery in othersthat is not mad thou should st go mad blacksmith say why dostthou not go mad how can st thou endure without being mad do the heavens yet hate thee that thou can st not go mad what wert thou making there welding an old pike head sir there were seams and dents in it and can st thou make it all smooth again blacksmith after such hardusage as it had i think so sir and i suppose thou can st smoothe almost any seams and dents never mind how hard the metal blacksmith aye sir i think i can all seams and dents but one look ye here then cried ahab passionately advancing and leaningwith both hands on perth s shoulders look ye here here can yesmoothe out a seam like this blacksmith sweeping one hand acrosshis ribbed brow if thou could st blacksmith glad enough wouldi lay my head upon thy anvil and feel thy heaviest hammer betweenmy eyes answer can st thou smoothe this seam oh that is the one sir said i not all seams and dents but one aye blacksmith it is the one aye man it is unsmoothable for though thou only see st it here in my flesh it has worked downinto the bone of my skull that is all wrinkles but away withchild s play no more gaffs and pikes to day look ye here jingling the leathern bag as if it were full of gold coins i too want a harpoon made one that a thousand yoke of fiends couldnot part perth something that will stick in a whale like his ownfin bone there s the stuff flinging the pouch upon the anvil look ye blacksmith these are the gathered nail stubbs of the steelshoes of racing horses horse shoe stubbs sir why captain ahab thou hast here then the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work i know it old man these stubbs will weld together like gluefrom the melted bones of murderers quick forge me the harpoon and forge me first twelve rods for its shank then wind and twist and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of atow line quick i ll blow the fire when at last the twelve rods were made ahab tried them one by one by spiralling them with his own hand round a long heavy iron bolt a flaw rejecting the last one work that over again perth this done perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one when ahab stayed his hand and said he would weld his own iron as then with regular gasping hems he hammered on the anvil perth passing to him the glowing rods one after the other and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame the parsee passed silently and bowing over his head towardsthe fire seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil but as ahab looked up he slid aside what s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for muttered stubb looking on from the forecastle that parsee smells fire like a fusee and smells of it himself like a hot musket s powder pan at last the shank in one complete rod received its final heat and as perth to temper it plunged it all hissing into the caskof water near by the scalding steam shot up into ahab s bent face would st thou brand me perth wincing for a moment with the pain have i been but forging my own branding iron then pray god not that yet i fear something captain ahab is not thisharpoon for the white whale for the white fiend but now for the barbs thou must makethem thyself man here are my razors the best of steel here and make the barbs sharp as the needle sleet of the icy sea for a moment the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he wouldfain not use them take them man i have no need for them for i now neither shave sup nor pray till but here to work fashioned at last into an arrowy shape and welded by perth to the shank the steel soon pointed the end of the iron and as the blacksmithwas about giving the barbs their final heat prior to tempering them he cried to ahab to place the water cask near no no no water for that i want it of the true death temper ahoy there tashtego queequeg daggoo what say ye pagans will yegive me as much blood as will cover this barb holding it high up a cluster of dark nods replied yes three punctures were madein the heathen flesh and the white whale s barbs were then tempered ego non baptizo te in nomine patris sed in nomine diaboli deliriously howled ahab as the malignant iron scorchinglydevoured the baptismal blood now mustering the spare poles from below and selecting one of hickory with the bark still investing it ahab fitted the end to the socketof the iron a coil of new tow line was then unwound and some fathomsof it taken to the windlass and stretched to a great tension pressing his foot upon it till the rope hummed like a harp string then eagerly bending over it and seeing no strandings ahab exclaimed good and now for the seizings at one extremity the rope was unstranded and the separate spreadyarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon the pole was then driven hard up into the socket from the lowerend the rope was traced halfway along the pole s length and firmly secured so with inter twistings of twine this done pole iron and rope like the three fates remained inseparable and ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon the sound of his ivory leg and the sound of the hickory pole both hollowly ringing along every plank but ere he enteredhis cabin a light unnatural half bantering yet most piteoussound was heard oh pip thy wretched laugh thy idlebut unresting eye all thy strange mummeries not unmeaninglyblended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship and mocked it chapter the gilderpenetrating further and further into the heart of the

pulling or sailing or paddling after the whales or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaitingtheir uprising though with but small success for their pains at such times under an abated sun afloat all day upon smooth slow heaving swells seated in his boat light as a birch canoe and so sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves that like hearth stone cats they purr against the gunwale these are the times of dreamy quietude when beholding the tranquilbeauty and brilliancy of the ocean s skin one forgets the tigerheart that pants beneath it and would not willingly remember that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang these are the times when in his whale boat the rover softly feelsa certain filial confident land like feeling towards the sea that heregards it as so much flowery earth and the distant ship revealingonly the tops of her masts seems struggling forward not through highrolling waves but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie as when the western emigrants horses only show their erected ears while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure the long drawn virgin vales the mild blue hill sides as over these there steals the hush the hum you almost swearthat play wearied children lie sleeping in these solitudes in some glad may time when the flowers of the woods are plucked and all this mixes with your most mystic mood so that fact and fancy half way meeting interpenetrate and form one seamless whole nor did such soothing scenes however temporary fail of at leastas temporary an effect on ahab but if

pequod meets the bachelorand jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing downbefore the wind some few weeks after ahab s harpoon had been welded it was a nantucket ship the bachelor which had just wedgedin her last cask of oil and bolted down her bursting hatches and now in glad holiday apparel was joyously though somewhatvain gloriously sailing round among the widely separated shipson the ground previous to pointing her prow for home the three men at her mast head wore long streamers of narrow redbunting at their hats from the stern a whale boat was suspended bottom down and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the longlower jaw of the last whale they had slain signals ensigns and jacks of all colors were flying from her rigging on every side sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrelsof sperm above which in her top mast cross trees you saw slenderbreakers of the same precious fluid and nailed to her main truckwas a brazen lamp as was afterwards learned the bachelor had met withthe most surprising success all the more wonderful for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vesselshad gone entire months without securing a single fish not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to makeroom for the far more valuable sperm but additional supplementalcasks had been bartered for from the ships she had met and thesewere stowed along the deck and in the captain s and officers state rooms even the cabin table itself had been knockedinto kindling wood and the cabin mess dined off the broad headof an oil butt lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece in the forecastle the sailors had actually caulked and pitchedtheir chests and filled them it was humorously added that thecook had clapped a head on his largest boiler and filled it that the steward had plugged his spare coffee pot and filled it that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their ironsand filled them that indeed everything was filled with sperm except the captain s pantaloons pockets and those he reservedto thrust his hands into in self complacent testimony ofhis entire satisfaction as this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody pequod the barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle and drawing still nearer a crowd of her men were seen standinground her huge try pots which covered with the parchment likepoke or stomach skin of the black fish gave forth a loudroar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew on the quarter deck the mates and harpooneers were dancing with theolive hued girls who had eloped with them from the polynesian isles while suspended in an ornamented boat firmly secured aloft betweenthe foremast and mainmast three long island negroes with glitteringfiddle bows of whale ivory were presiding over the hilarious jig meanwhile others of the ship s company were tumultuously busy atthe masonry of the try works from which the huge pots had been removed you would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed bastille such wild cries they raised as the now useless brick and mortarwere being hurled into the sea lord and master over all this scene the captain stood erecton the ship s elevated quarter deck so that the whole rejoicingdrama was full before him and seemed merely contrived for hisown individual diversion and ahab he too was standing on his quarter deck shaggy and black with a stubborn gloom and as the two ships crossed each other s wakes one all jubilations for things passed the other all forebodingsas to things to come their two captains in themselves impersonatedthe whole striking contrast of the scene come aboard come aboard cried the gay bachelor s commander lifting a glass and a bottle in the air hast seen the white whale gritted ahab in reply no only heard of him but don t believe in him at all said the other good humoredly come aboard thou art too damned jolly sail on hast lost any men not enough to speak of two islanders that s all but come aboard old hearty come along i ll soon take that black from your brow come along will ye merry s the play a full ship and homeward bound how wondrous familiar is a fool muttered ahab then aloud thou arta full ship and homeward bound thou sayest well then call mean empty ship and outward bound so go thy ways and i will mine forward there set all sail and keep her to the wind and thus while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze the other stubbornly fought against it and so the two vessels parted the crew of the pequod looking with grave lingering glancestowards the receding bachelor but the bachelor s men never heedingtheir gaze for the lively revelry they were in and as ahab leaning over the taffrail eyed the homewardbound craft he tookfrom his pocket a small vial of sand and then looking from the shipto the vial seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together for that vial was filled with nantucket soundings chapter the dying whalenot seldom in this life when on the right side fortune s favoritessail close by us we though all adroop before catch somewhatof the rushing breeze and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out so seemed it with the pequod for next day after encounteringthe gay bachelor whales were seen and four were slain and one of them by ahab it was far down the afternoon and when all the spearings of the crimsonfight were done and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky sun and whale both stilly died together then such a sweetness andsuch plaintiveness such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleysof the manilla isles the spanish land breeze wantonly turned sailor had gone to sea freighted with these vesper hymns soothed again but only soothed to deeper gloom ahab who had sternedoff from the whale sat intently watching his final wanings fromthe now tranquil boat for that strange spectacle observable in allsperm whales dying the turning sunwards of the head and so expiring that strange spectacle beheld of such a placid evening somehow to ahabconveyed a wondrousness unknown before he turns and turns him to it how slowly but how steadfastly his homage rendering and invoking brow with his last dying motions he too worships fire most faithful broad baronial vassal of the sun oh that these too favoring eyes should see these too favoring sights look here far water locked beyond all hum of human weal or woe in these most candid and impartial seas where to traditions no rocksfurnish tablets where for long chinese ages the billows have stillrolled on speechless and unspoken to as stars that shine uponthe niger s unknown source here too life dies sunwards full of faith but see no sooner dead than death whirls round the corpse and itheads some other way oh thou dark hindoo half of nature who of drowned bones hast buildedthy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas thou art an infidel thou queen and too truly speakest to me in thewide slaughtering typhoon and the hushed burial of its after calm nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head and then goneround again without a lesson to me oh trebly hooped and welded hip of power oh high aspiring rainbowed jet that one strivest this one jettest all in vain in vain oh whale dost thou seek intercedings with yonall quickening sun that only calls forth life but gives it not again yet dost thou darker half rock me with a prouder if a darker faith all thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here i am buoyedby breaths of once living things exhaled as air but water now then hail for ever hail o sea in whose eternal tossings the wildfowl finds his only rest born of earth yet suckled by the sea though hill and valley mothered me ye billows are my foster brothers chapter the whale watchthe four whales slain that evening had died wide apart one far to windward one less distant to leeward one ahead one astern these last three were brought alongside ere nightfall but the windward one could not be reached till morning and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night and that boat was ahab s the waif pole was thrust upright into the dead whale s spout hole and the lantern hanging from its top cast a troubled flickering glareupon the black glossy back and far out upon the midnight waves which gently chafed the whale s broad flank like soft surf upon a beach ahab and all his boat s crew seemed asleep but the parsee who crouchingin the bow sat watching the sharks that spectrally played roundthe whale and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails a sound like the moaning in squadrons over asphaltites of unforgivenghosts of gomorrah ran shuddering through the air started from his slumbers ahab face to face saw the parsee and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last menin a flooded world i have dreamed it again said he of the hearses have i not said old man that neither hearsenor coffin can be thine and who are hearsed that die on the sea but i said old man that ere thou couldst die on this voyage two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea the first notmade by mortal hands and the visible wood of the last one mustbe grown in america aye aye a strange sight that parsee a hearse and its plumes floatingover the ocean with the waves for the pall bearers ha such a sightwe shall not soon see believe it or not thou canst not die till it be seen old man and what was that saying about thyself though it come to the last i shall still go before thee thy pilot and when thou art so gone before if that ever befall then erei can follow thou must still appear to me to pilot me still was it not so well then did i believe all ye say oh my pilot i have here two pledges that i shall yet slay moby dick and survive it take another pledge old man said the parsee as his eyes lightedup like fire flies in the gloom hemp only can kill thee the gallows ye mean i am immortal then on land and on sea cried ahab with a laugh of derision immortal on land and on sea both were silent again as one man the grey dawn came on and the slumbering crew arose from the boat s bottom and erenoon the dead whale was brought to the ship chapter the quadrantthe season for the line at length drew near and everyday when ahab coming from his cabin cast his eyes aloft the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces and would standthere with all their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon impatient for the order to point the ship s prow for the equator in good time the order came it was hard upon high noon and ahab seated in the bows of his high hoisted boat was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sunto determine his latitude now in that japanese sea the days in summer are as freshetsof effulgences that unblinkingly vivid japanese sunseems the blazing focus of the glassy ocean s immeasurableburning glass the sky looks lacquered clouds there are none the horizon floats and this nakedness of unrelievedradiance is as the insufferable splendors of god s throne well that ahab s quadrant was furnished with colored glasses through which to take sight of that solar fire so swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship and with his astrological looking instrument placed to his eye he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the preciseinstant when the sun should gain its precise meridian meantime while his whole attention was absorbed the parseewas kneeling beneath him on the ship s deck and with facethrown up like ahab s was eyeing the same sun with him only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs and hiswild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness at length the desired observation was taken and with his pencilupon his ivory leg ahab soon calculated what his latitude mustbe at that precise instant then falling into a moment s revery he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself thou seamark thou high and mighty pilot thou tellest me trulywhere i am but canst thou cast the least hint where i shall be or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is thismoment living where is moby dick this instant thou mustbe eyeing him these eyes of mine look into the very eyethat is even now beholding him aye and into the eye thatis even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown thither side of thee thou sun then gazing at his quadrant and handling one after the other its numerous cabalistical contrivances he pondered again and muttered foolish toy babies plaything of haughty admirals and commodores and captains the world brags of thee of thy cunning and might but what after all canst thou do but tell the poor pitiful point where thou thyself happenestto be on this wide planet and the hand that holds thee no not one jot more thou canst not tell where one dropof water or one grain of sand will be to morrow noon and yetwith thy impotence thou insultest the sun science curse thee thou vain toy and cursed be all the things that cast man s eyes aloft to that heaven whose live vividness but scorches him as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light o sun level by nature to this earth s horizon are the glances of man s eyes not shot from the crown of his head as if god had meanthim to gaze on his firmament curse thee thou quadrant dashing it to the deck no longer will i guide my earthly wayby thee the level ship s compass and the level deadreckoning by log and by line these shall conduct me and show me my placeon the sea aye lighting from the boat to the deck thus itrample on thee thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high thus i split and destroy thee as the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his liveand dead feet a sneering triumph that seemed meant for ahab and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself these passed over the mute motionless parsee s face unobserved he rose and glided away while awestruck by the aspectof their commander the seamen clustered together on the forecastle till ahab troubledly pacing the deck shouted out to the braces up helm square in in an instant the yards swung round and as the ship half wheeledupon her heel her three firm seated graceful masts erectly poisedupon her long ribbed hull seemed as the three horatii pirouettingon one sufficient steed standing between the knight heads starbuck watched the pequod stumultuous way and ahab s also as he went lurching along the deck i have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow full of its tormented flaming life and i have seen it waneat last down down to dumbest dust old man of oceans of all this fiery life of thine what will at length remainbut one little heap of ashes aye cried stubb but sea coal ashes mind ye that mr starbuck sea coal not your common charcoal well well i heardahab

tornadoes that never swept tamenorthern lands so too it is that in these resplendentjapanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all storms the typhoon it will sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town towards evening of that day the pequod was torn of her canvas and bare poled was left to fight a typhoon which had struckher directly ahead when darkness came on sky and sea roaredand split with the thunder and blazed with the lightning that showed the disabled mast fluttering here and therewith the rags which the first fury of the tempest had leftfor its after sport holding by a shroud starbuck was standing on the quarter deck at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft to seewhat additional disaster might have befallen the intricatehamper there while stubb and flask were directing the menin the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats but all their pains seemed naught though lifted to the very topof the cranes the windward quarter boat ahab s did not escape a great rolling sea dashing high up against the reeling ship shigh teetering side stove in the boat s bottom at the stern and left it again all dripping through like a sieve bad work bad work mr starbuck said stubb regarding the wreck but the sea will have its way stubb for one can t fight it you see mr starbuck a wave has such a great long start before it leaps all round the world it runs and then comes the spring but as for me all the start i have to meet it is just across the deck here but never mind it s all in fun so the old song says sings oh jolly is the gale and a joker is the whale a flourishin his tail such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky pokylad is the ocean oh the scud all a flyin that s his flip only foamin when he

was a brave man i am a coward and i sing to keep up my spirits and i tell you what it is mr starbuck there s no wayto stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat and when that s done ten to one i sing ye the doxologyfor a wind up madman look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own what how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else never mind how foolish here cried starbuck seizing stubb by the shoulder and pointinghis hand towards the weather bow markest thou not that the galecomes from the eastward the very course ahab is to run for moby dick the very course he swung to this day noon now mark his boat there where is that stove in the stern sheets man where he is wont to stand his stand point is stove man now jump overboard and sing away if thou must i don t half understand ye what s in the wind yes yes round the cape of good hope is the shortest way to nantucket soliloquized starbuck suddenly heedless of stubb s question the gale that now hammers at us to stave us we can turn it into a fairwind that will drive us towards home yonder to windward all isblackness of doom but to leeward homeward i see it lightens up there but not with the lightning at that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness following the flashes a voice was heard at his side and almostat the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead who s there old thunder said ahab groping his way along the bulwarksto his pivot hole but suddenly finding his path made plainto him by elbowed lances of fire now as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry offthe perilous fluid into the soil so the kindred rod which at sea someships carry to each mast is intended to conduct it into the water but as this conductor must descend to considerable depth that its end may avoid all contact with the hull and as moreover if kept constantly towing there it would be liable to many mishaps besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging and moreor less impeding the vessel s way in the water because of all this the lower parts of a ship s lightning rods are not always overboard but are generally made in long slender links so as to be the morereadily hauled up into the chains outside or thrown down into the sea as occasion may require the rods the rods cried starbuck to the crew suddenly admonishedto vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux to light ahab to his post are they overboard drop them over fore and aft quick avast cried ahab let s have fair play here though we bethe weaker side yet i ll contribute to raise rods on the himmalehsand andes that all the world may be secured but out on privileges let them be sir look aloft cried starbuck the corpusants the corpusants all the yard arms were tipped with a pallid fire and touched ateach tri pointed lightning rod end with three tapering white flames each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar blast the boat let it go cried stubb at this instant as a swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft so that itsgunwale violently jammed his hand as he was passing a lashing blast it but slipping backward on the deck his uplifted eyescaught the flames and immediately shifting his tone he cried thecorpusants have mercy on us all to sailors oaths are household words they will swearin the trance of the calm and in the teeth of the tempest they will imprecate curses from the topsail yard arms when mostthey teeter over to a seething sea but in all my voyagings seldom have i heard a common oath when god s burning finger hasbeen laid on the ship when his mene mene tekel upharsin has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage while this pallidness was burning aloft few words were heard fromthe enchanted crew who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence like a farawayconstellation of stars relieved against the ghostly light the gigantic jet negro daggoo loomed up to thrice his real stature and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come the parted mouth of tashtego revealed his shark white teeth which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants while lit up by the preternatural light queequeg s tattooing burnedlike satanic blue flames on his body the tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft and oncemore the pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall a moment or two passed when starbuck going forward pushed againstsome one it was stubb what thinkest thou now man i heard thy cry it was not the same in the song no no it wasn t i said the corpusants have mercy on us all and i hope they will still but do they only havemercy on long faces have they no bowels for a laugh and look ye mr starbuck but it s too dark to look hear me then i take that mast head flame we saw for a signof good luck for those masts are rooted in a hold that isgoing to be chock a block with sperm oil d ye see and so all that sperm will work up into the masts like sap in a tree yes our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti candles that s the good promise we saw at that moment starbuck caught sight of stubb s face slowlybeginning to glimmer into sight glancing upwards he cried see see and once more the high tapering flames were beheldwith what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor the corpusants have mercy on us all cried stubb again at the base of the main mast full beneath the doubloon and the flame the parsee was kneeling in ahab s front but with his head bowed awayfrom him while near by from the arched and overhanging rigging where they had just been engaged securing a spar a number of the seamen arrested by the glare now cohered together and hung pendulous like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping orchard twig in various enchanted attitudes like the standing or stepping or running skeletons in herculaneum others remained rooted to the deck but all their eyes upcast aye aye men cried ahab look up at it mark it well the white flame but lights the way to the white whale hand methose mainmast links there i would fain feel this pulse and let mine beat against it blood against fire so then turning the last link held fast in his left hand he put his footupon the parsee and with fixed upward eye and high flung right arm he stood erect before the lofty tri pointed trinity of flames oh thou clear spirit of clear fire whom on these seas i aspersian once did worship till in the sacramental act so burnedby thee that to this hour i bear the scar i now know thee thou clear spirit and i now know that thy right worshipis defiance to neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind and e en for hate thou canst but

midst of the personified impersonal a personality stands here though but a point at best whenceso er i came whereso er i go yet while i earthly live the queenly personality lives in me and feels her royal rights but war is pain and hate is woe come in thy lowest form of love and i will kneel and kiss thee but at thy highest come as mere supernal power and thoughthou launchest navies of full freighted worlds there s that inhere that still remains indifferent oh thou clear spirit of thy fire thou madest me and like a true child of fire i breathe it back to thee sudden repeated flashes of lightning the nine flames leap lengthwiseto thrice their previous height ahab with the rest closes his eyes his right hand pressed hard upon them i own thy speechless placeless power said i not so nor was it wrung from me nor do i now drop these links thou canst blind but i can then grope thou canst consume but i can then be ashes take the homage of these poor eyes and shutter hands i would not take it the lightningflashes through my skull mine eyeballs ache and ache my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded and rolling on somestunning ground oh oh yet blindfold yet will i talk to thee light though thou be thou leapest out of darkness but i am darkness leaping out of light leaping out of thee the javelins cease open eyes see or not there burn the flames oh thou magnanimous now do i do

welded with thee defyingly i worship thee the boat the boat cried starbuck look at thy boat old man ahab s harpoon the one forged at perth s fire remained firmlylashed in its conspicuous crotch so that it projected beyondhis whale boat s bow but the sea that had stove its bottom hadcaused the loose leather sheath to drop off and from the keensteel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale forked fire as the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent s tongue starbuck grasped ahab by the arm god god is against thee old man forbear t is an ill voyage ill begun ill continued let me square the yards while we may old man and make a fairwind of it homewards to go on a better voyage than this overhearing starbuck the panic stricken crew instantlyran to the braces though not a sail was left aloft for the moment all the aghast mate s thoughts seemed theirs they raised a half mutinous cry but dashing the rattlinglightning links to the deck and snatching the burning harpoon ahab waved it like a torch among them swearing to transfixwith it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope s end petrified by his aspect and still more shrinking fromthe fiery dart that he held the men fell back in dismay and ahab again spoke all your oaths to hunt the white whale are as binding as mine and heart soul and body lungs and life old ahab is bound and that ye may know to what tune this heart beats look ye here thus i blow out the last fear and with one blast of his breathhe extinguished the flame as in the hurricane that sweeps the plain men fly the neighborhoodof some lone gigantic elm whose very height and strength but render itso much the more unsafe because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts so at those last words of ahab s many of the mariners did run from himin a terror of

into me what you were just now saying and how long ago is it since you said the very contrary didn t you once say that whatever ship ahab sails in that ship should pay something extra on its insurance policy just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxesof lucifers forward stop now didn t you say so well suppose i did what then i ve part changed my fleshsince that time why not my mind besides supposing weare loaded with powder barrels aft and lucifers forward how the devil could the lucifers get afire in this drenchingspray here why my little man you have pretty red hair but you couldn t get afire now shake yourself you re aquarius or the water bearer flask might fill pitchers at yourcoat collar don t you see then that for these extrarisks the marine insurance companies have extra guarantees here are hydrants flask but hark again and i ll answerye the other thing first take your leg off from the crownof the anchor here though so i can pass the rope now listen what s the mighty difference between holding a mast slightning rod in the storm and standing close by a mastthat hasn t got any lightning rod at all in a storm don t you see you timber head that no harm can cometo the holder of the rod unless the mast is first struck what are you talking about then not one ship in a hundredcarries rods and ahab aye man and all of us were in nomore danger then in my poor opinion than all the crews in tenthousand ships now sailing the seas why you king post you i suppose you would have every man in the world go about with a smalllightning rod running up the corner of his hat like a militiaofficer s skewered feather and trailing behind like his sash why don t ye be sensible flask it s easy to be sensible why don t ye then any man with half an eye can be sensible i don t know that stubb you sometimes find it rather hard yes when a fellow s soaked through it s hard to be sensible that s a fact and i am about drenched with this spray never mind catch the turn there and pass it seems to me we are lashing downthese anchors now as if they were never going to be used again tying these two anchors here flask seems like tying a man s handsbehind him and what big generous hands they are to be sure these are your iron fists hey what a hold they have too i wonder flask whether the world is anchored anywhere if she is she swings with an uncommon long cable though there hammer that knot down and we ve done so next totouching land lighting on deck is the most satisfactory i say just wring out my jacket skirts will ye thank ye they laugh at long togs so flask but seems to me a long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat the tails tapering down that way serve to carry off the water d ye see same with cocked hats the cocks form gable endeave

too much thunder up here what s the use of thunder um um um we don t want thunder we want rum give us a glass of rum um um um chapter the musketduring the most violent shocks of the typhoon the man at the pequod sjaw bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by itsspasmodic motions even though preventer tackles had been attached to it for they were slack because some play to the tiller was indispensable in a severe gale like this while the ship is but a tossedshuttlecock to the blast it is by no means uncommon to seethe needles in the compasses at intervals go round and round it was thus with the pequod s at almost every shock the helmsmanhad not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which theyrevolved upon the cards it is a sight that hardly anyone canbehold without some sort of unwonted emotion some hours after midnight the typhoon abated so much that through the strenuous exertions of starbuck and stubb one engaged forward and the other aft the shivered remnants ofthe jib and fore and main top sails were cut adrift from the spars and went eddying away to leeward like the feathers of an albatross which sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm tossed birdis on the wing the three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed and a storm trysail was set further aft so that the ship soonwent through the water with some precision again and the course for the present east south east which he was to steer if practicable was once more given to the helmsman for during the violenceof the gale he had only steered according to its vicissitudes but as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible watching the compass meanwhile lo a good sign the wind seemedcoming round astern aye the foul breeze became fair instantly the yards were squared to the lively song of ho the fair wind oh ye ho cheerly men the crew singing for joy that so promising an event should so soon have falsified the evilportents preceding it in compliance with the standing order of his commander to report immediately and at any one of the twenty four hours any decided change in the affairs of the deck starbuck hadno sooner trimmed the yards to the breeze however reluctantlyand gloomily than he mechanically went below to apprisecaptain ahab of the circumstance ere knocking at his state room he involuntarily paused before ita moment the cabin lamp taking long swings this way and that was burning fitfully and casting fitful shadows upon the oldman s bolted door a thin one with fixed blinds inserted in place of upper panels the isolated subterraneousnessof the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements the loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead starbuck was an honest upright man but out of starbuck s heart at that instant when he saw the muskets there strangelyevolved an evil thought but so blent with its neutral or goodaccompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself he would have shot me once he murmured yes there s the verymusket that he pointed at me that one with the studded stock let me touch it lift it strange that i who havehandled so many deadly lances strange that i should shakeso now loaded i must see aye aye and powder in the pan that s not good best spill it wait i ll cure myself of this i ll hold the musket boldly while i think i come to reporta fair wind to him but how fair fair for death and doom that s fair for moby dick it s a fair wind that s only fair forthat accursed fish the very tube he pointed at me the very one this one i hold it here he would have killed me with the verything i handle now aye and he would fain kill all his crew does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant and in these sameperilous seas gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoningof the error abounding log and in this very typhoon did he notswear that he would have no lightning rods but shall this crazedold man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship s company downto doom with him yes it would make him the wilful murdererof thirty men and more if this ship come to any deadly harm and come to deadly harm my soul swears this ship will if ahab have his way if then he were this instant put aside that crime would not be his ha is he mutteringin his sleep yes just there in there he s sleeping sleeping aye but still alive and soon awake again i can t withstand thee then old man not reasoning not remonstrance not entreaty wilt thou hearken to all this thou scornest flat obedience to thy own flat commands this is all thou breathest aye and say st the men have vow dthy vow say st all of us are

he were pinioned even knotted all over with ropesand hawsers chained down to ring bolts on this cabin floor he would be more hideous than a caged tiger then i couldnot endure the sight could not

moby dick i clutch thy heart at last such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man stormented sleep as if starbuck s voice had caused the long dumbdream to speak the yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard s arm against the panel starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel but turning from the door he placed the death tube in its rack and left the place he s too sound asleep mr

teetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit he turned to eye the bright sun s rays produced ahead and when she profoundly settled by the stern he turned behind and saw the sun s rearward place and how the same yellow rayswere blending with his undeviating wake ha ha my ship thou mightest well be taken now for the sea chariot ofthe sun ho ho all ye nations before my prow i bring the sun to ye yoke on the further billows hallo a tandem i drive the sea but suddenly reined back by some counter thought he hurried towardsthe helm huskily demanding how the ship was heading east sou east sir said the frightened steersman thou liest smiting him with his clenched fist heading east at this hour in the morning and the sun astern upon this every soul was confounded for the phenomenon justthen observed by ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else but its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause thrusting his head half way into the binnacle ahab caughtone glimpse of the compasses his uplifted arm slowly fell for a moment he almost seemed to stagger standing behindhim starbuck looked and lo the two compasses pointed east and the pequod was as infallibly going west but ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew the oldman with a rigid laugh exclaimed i have it it has happened before mr starbuck last night s thunder turned our compasses that s all thou hast before now heard of such a thing i take it aye but never before has it happened to me sir said thepale mate gloomily here it must needs be said that accidents like this havein more than one case occurred to ships in violent storms the magnetic energy as developed in the mariner s needle is as all know essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven hence it is not to be much marvelled at that such things should be in instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging the effect uponthe needle has at times been still more fatal all its loadstonevirtue being annihilated so that the before magnetic steel was of nomore use than an old wife s knitting needle but in either case the needle never again of itself recovers the original virtuethus marred or lost and if the binnacle compasses be affected the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson deliberately standing before the binnacle and eyeingthe transpointed compasses the old man with the sharpof his extended hand now took the precise bearing of the sun and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted shouted outhis orders for the ship s course to be changed accordingly the yards were hard up and once more the pequod thrust herundaunted bows into the opposing wind for the supposed fairone had only been juggling her meanwhile whatever were his own secret thoughts starbucksaid nothing but quietly he issued all requisite orders while stubb and flask who in some small degree seemed thento be sharing his feelings likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced as for the men though some of them lowly rumbled their fearof ahab was greater than their fear of fate but as ever before the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed or if impressed it was only with a certain magnetism shotinto their congenial hearts from inflexible ahab s for a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries but chancing to slip with his ivory heel he saw the crushedcopper sight tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashedto the deck thou poor proud heaven gazer and sun s pilot yesterday iwrecked thee and to day the compasses would fain have wrecked me so so but ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet mr starbuck a lance without the pole a top maul and the smallestof the sail maker s needles quick accessory perhaps to the impulse dictating the thing he was now aboutto do were certain prudential motives whose object might have beento revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses besides the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles though clumsily practicable was not a thing to be passed over bysuperstitious sailors without some shudderings and evil portents men said he steadily turning upon the crew as the matehanded him the things he had demanded my men the thunderturned old ahab s needles but out of this bit of steel ahabcan make one of his own that will point as true as any abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors as this was said and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatevermagic might follow but starbuck looked away with a blow from the top maul ahab knocked off the steel head ofthe lance and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining bade him hold it upright without its touching the deck then with the maul after repeatedly smiting the upper end of thisiron rod he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it and less strongly hammered that several times the mate still holdingthe rod as before then going through some small strange motionswith it whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew is uncertain he called for linen thread and moving to the binnacle slipped outthe two reversed needles there and horizontally suspended thesail needle by its middle over one of the compass cards at first the steel went round and round quivering and vibrating at either end but at last it settled to its place when ahab who had been intentlywatching for this result stepped frankly back from the binnacle and pointing his stretched arm towards it exclaimed look ye for yourselves if ahab be not the lord of the level loadstone the sun is east and that compass swears it one after another they peered in for nothing but their own eyescould persuade such ignorance as theirs and one after anotherthey slunk away in his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph you then saw ahabin all his fatal pride chapter the log and linewhile now the fated pequod had been so long afloat this voyage the log and line had but very seldom been in use owing to a confident reliance upon other means of determiningthe vessel s place some merchantmen and many whalemen especially when cruising wholly neglect to heave the log though at the same time and frequently more for form s sakethan anything else regularly putting down upon the customaryslate the course steered by the ship as well as the presumedaverage rate of progression every hour it had been thuswith the pequod the wooden reel and angular log attached hung long untouched just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks rains and spray had damped it the sun and wind had warped it all the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly but heedless of all this his mood seized ahab as he happenedto glance upon the reel not many hours after the magnet scene and he remembered how his quadrant was no more and recalledhis frantic oath about the level log and line the ship wassailing plungingly astern the billows rolled in riots forward there heave the log two seamen came the golden hued tahitian and the grizzly manxman take the reel one of ye i ll heave they went towards the extreme stern on the ship s lee side where the deck with the oblique energy of the wind was nowalmost dipping into the creamy sidelong rushing sea the manxman took the reel and holding it high up by the projectinghandle ends of the spindle round which the spool of line revolved so stood with the angular log hanging downwards till ahabadvanced to him ahab stood before him and was lightly unwinding some thirtyor forty turns to form a preliminary hand coil to toss overboard when the old manxman who was intently eyeing both him and the line made bold to speak sir i mistrust it this line looks far gone long heat and wethave spoiled it twill hold old gentleman long heat and wet have they spoiled thee thou seem st to hold or truer perhaps life holds thee not thou it i hold the spool sir but just as my captain says with these grey hairs of mine tis not worth while disputing specially with a superior who ll ne er confess what s that there now s a patched professor in queen nature sgranite founded college but methinks he s too subservient where wert thou born in the little rocky isle of man sir excellent thou st hit the world by that i know not sir but i was born there in the isle of man hey well the other way it s good here s a man from man a man born in once independent man and nowunmanned of man which is sucked in by what up with the reel the dead blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last up with it so the log was heaved the loose coils rapidly straightened out in a longdragging line astern and then instantly the reel began to whirl in turn jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows the towingresistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely hold hard snap the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon the tugging log was gone i crush the quadrant the thunder turns the needles and now the mad sea parts the log line but ahab can mend all haul in here tahitian reel up manxman and look ye let the carpenter make another log and mend thou the line see to it there he goes now to him nothing s happened but to me the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world haul in haul in tahitian these lines run whole and whirling out come in broken and dragging slow ha pip come to help eh pip pip whom call ye pip pip jumped from the whaleboat pip s missing let s see now if ye haven t fished himup here fisherman it drags hard i guess he s holding on jerk him tahiti jerk him off we haul in no cowards here ho there s his arm just breaking water a hatchet a hatchet cut it off we haul in no cowards here captain ahab sir sir here s pip trying to get on board again peace thou crazy loon cried the manxman seizing him by the arm away from the quarter deck the greater idiot ever scolds the lesser muttered ahab advancing hands off from that holiness where sayest thou pip was boy astern there sir astern lo lo and who art thou boy i see not my reflection in the vacant pupilsof thy eyes oh god that man should be a thing for immortal soulsto sieve through who art thou boy bell boy sir ship s

touchest my inmost centre boy thou art tied to me by cordswoven of my heart strings come let s down what s this here s velvet shark skin intently gazing at ahab s hand and feeling it ah now had poor pip but felt so kind a thing as this perhaps he had ne er been lost this seems to me sir as a man rope something that weak souls may hold by oh sir let old perth now comeand rivet these two hands together the black one with the white for i will not let this go oh boy nor will i thee unless i should thereby drag theeto worse horrors than are here come then to my cabin lo ye believers in gods all goodness and in man all ill lo you see the omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man and man though idiotic and knowing not what he does yet fullof the sweet things of love and gratitude come i feel prouderleading thee by thy black hand than though i grasped an emperor s there go two daft ones now muttered the old manxman one daft with strength the other daft with weakness but here s the end of the rotten line all dripping too mend it eh i think we had best have a new line altogether i ll see mr stubb about it chapter the life buoysteering now south eastward by ahab s levelled steel and her progress solely determined by ahab s level log and line the pequod held on her path towards the equator making so longa passage through such unfrequented waters descrying no ships and ere long sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds over waves monotonously mild all these seemed the strange calmthings preluding some riotous and desperate scene at last when the ship drew near to the outskirts as it were of the equatorial fishing ground and in the deep darkness thatgoes before the dawn was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets the watch then headed by flask was startled by a cry so plaintivelywild and unearthly like half articulated wailings of the ghostsof all herod s murdered innocents that one and all they startedfrom their reveries and for the space of some moments stood or sat or leaned all transfixed by listening like the carvedroman slave while that wild cry remained within hearing the christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids and shuddered but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled yet the grey manxman the oldest mariner of all declared thatthe wild thrilling sounds that were heard were the voices of newlydrowned men in the sea below in his hammock ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn when he came to the deck it was then recounted to him by flask not unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings he hollowly laughed and thus explained the wonder those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbersof seals and some young seals that had lost their dams or some damsthat had lost their cubs must have risen nigh the ship and keptcompany with her crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail but this only the more affected some of them because most marinerscherish a very superstitious feeling about seals arising not only fromtheir peculiar tones when in distress but also from the human lookof their round heads and semi intelligent faces seen peeringly uprisingfrom the water alongside in the sea under certain circumstances seals have more than once been mistaken for men but the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausibleconfirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning at sun rise this man went from his hammock to his mast head at the fore and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state whether itwas thus with the man there is now no telling but be that as it may he had not been long at his perch when a cry was heard a cryand a rushing and looking up they saw a falling phantom in the air and looking down a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blueof the sea the life buoy a long slender cask was dropped from the stern where italways hung obedient to a cunning spring but no hand rose to seize it and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken so that itslowly filled and the parched wood also filled at its every pore and the studded iron bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom as if to yield him his pillow though in sooth but a hard one and thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mastto look out for the white whale on the white whale s ownpeculiar ground that man was swallowed up in the deep but few perhaps thought of that at the time indeed in some sort they were not grieved at this event at least as a portent for they regarded it not as a fore shadowing of evil inthe future but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged they declared that now they knew the reason of those wildshrieks they had heard the night before but again the oldmanxman said nay the lost life buoy was now to be replaced starbuck was directedto see to it but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found and as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisisof the voyage all hands were impatient of any toil but what wasdirectly connected with its final end whatever that might proveto be therefore they were going to leave the ship s stern unprovidedwith a buoy when by certain strange signs and inuendoes queequeghinted a hint concerning his coffin a life buoy of a coffin cried starbuck starting rather queer that i should say said stubb it will make a good enough one said flask the carpenter here canarrange it easily bring it up there s nothing else for it said starbuck after a melancholy pause rig it carpenter do not look at me so the coffin i mean dost thou hear me rig it and shall i nail down the lid sir moving his hand as with a hammer aye and shall i caulk the seams sir moving his hand aswith a caulking iron aye and shall i then pay over the same with pitch sir moving his handas with a pitch pot away what possesses thee to this make a life buoy of the coffin and no more mr stubb mr flask come forward with me he goes off in a huff the whole he can endure at the partshe baulks now i don t like this i make a leg for captain ahab and he wears it like a gentleman but i make a bandbox for queequeg and he won t put his head into it are all my pains to go for nothingwith that coffin and now i m ordered to make a life buoy of it it s like turning an old coat going to bring the flesh onthe other side now i don t like this cobbling sort of business i don t like it at all it s undignified it s not my place let tinkers brats do tinkerings we are their betters i like to takein hand none but clean virgin fair and square mathematical jobs something that regularly begins at the beginning and is at the middlewhen midway and comes to an end at the conclusion not a cobbler s job that s at an end in the middle and at the beginning at the end it s the old woman s tricks to be giving cobbling jobs lord what an affection all old women have for tinkers i know an oldwoman of sixty five who ran away with a bald headed young tinker once and that s the reason i never would work for lonely widow oldwomen ashore when i kept my job shop in the vineyard they mighthave taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me but heigh ho there are no caps at sea but snow caps let me see nail down the lid caulk the seams pay over the same with pitch batten them down tight and hang it with the snap spring overthe ship s stern were ever such things done before with a coffin some superstitious old carpenters now would be tied up in the rigging ere they would do the job but i m made of knotty aroostook hemlock i don t budge cruppered with a coffin sailing about witha grave yard tray but never mind we workers in woods makebridal bedsteads and card tables as well as coffins and hearses we work by the month or by the job or by the profit not for us to askthe why and wherefore of our work unless it be too confounded cobbling and then we stash it if we can hem i ll do the job now tenderly i ll have me let s see how many in the ship s company all told but i ve forgotten any way i ll have me thirty separate turk s headedlife lines each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin then if the hull go down there ll be thirty lively fellows allfighting for one coffin a sight not seen very often beneath the sun come hammer caulking iron pitch pot and marling spike let s to it chapter the deckthe coffin laid upon two line tubs between the vice benchand the open hatchway the carpenter caulking its seams the string of twisted oakum slowly unwinding from a large rollof it placed in the bosom of his frock ahab comes slowlyfrom the cabin gangway and hears pip following him back lad i will be with ye again presently he goes not this hand complies with my humor more genially than that boy middle aisle of a church what s here life buoy sir mr starbuck s orders oh look sir beware the hatchway thank ye man thy coffin lies handy to the vault sir the hatchway oh so it does sir so it does art not thou the leg maker look did not this stump comefrom thy shop i believe it did sir does the ferrule stand sir well enough but art thou not also the undertaker aye sir i patched up this thing here as a coffin for queequeg but they ve set me now to turning it into something else then tell me art thou not an arrant all grasping intermeddling monopolizing heathenish old scamp to be one day making legs and the next day coffins to clap them in and yet again life buoysout of those same coffins thou art as unprincipled as the gods and as much of a jack of all trades but i do not mean anything sir i do as i do the gods again hark ye dost thou not ever sing working abouta coffin the titans they say hummed snatches when chipping outthe craters for volcanoes and the grave digger in the play sings spade in hand dost thou never sing sir do i sing oh i m indifferent enough sir for that but the reason why the grave digger made music must have been becausethere was none in his spade sir but the caulking mallet is full of it hark to it aye and that s because the lid there s a sounding board and what in all things makes the sounding board is this there s naught beneath and yet a coffin with a body in it ringspretty much the same carpenter hast thou ever helped carry a bier and heard the coffin knock against the churchyard gate going in faith sir i ve faith what s that why faith sir it s only a sort of exclamation like that s all sir um um go on i was about to say sir that art thou a silk worm dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself look at thy bosom despatch and get these traps out of sight he goes aft that was sudden now but squalls come suddenin hot latitudes i ve heard that the isle of albermarle one of the gallipagos is cut by the equator right in the middle seems to me some sort of equator cuts yon old man too right inhis middle he s always under the line fiery hot i tell ye he s looking this way come oakum quick here we go again this wooden mallet is the cork and i m the professor ofmusical glasses tap tap ahab to himself there s a sight there s a sound the greyheaded wood peckertapping the hollow tree blind and dumb might well be envied now see that thing rests on two line tubs full of tow lines a most malicious wag that fellow rat tat so man sseconds tick oh how immaterial are all materials what things real are there but imponderable thoughts here now s the very dreaded symbol of grim death by a mere hap made the expressive sign of the help and hope of mostendangered life a life buoy of a coffin does it go further can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is after all but an immortality preserver i ll think of that but no so far gone am i in the dark side of earth that its other side the theoretic bright one seems but uncertain twilight to me will ye never have done carpenter with that accursed sound i go below let me not see that thing here when i return again now then pip we ll talk this over i do suck most wondrousphilosophies from thee some unknown conduits from the unknownworlds must empty into thee chapter the pequod meets the rachelnext day a large ship the rachel was descried bearing directlydown upon the pequod all her spars thickly clustering with men at the time the pequod was making good speed through the water but as the broad winged windward stranger shot nigh to her the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst and all life fled from the smitten hull bad news she brings bad news muttered the old manxman but ereher commander who with trumpet to mouth stood up in his boat ere he could hopefully hail ahab s voice was heard hast seen the white whale aye yesterday have ye seen a whale boat adrift throttling his joy ahab negatively answered this unexpected question and would then have fain boarded the stranger when the strangercaptain himself having stopped his vessel s way was seendescending her side a few keen pulls and his boat hook soonclinched the pequod s main chains and he sprang to the deck immediately he was recognized by ahab for a nantucketer he knew but no formal salutation was exchanged where was he not killed not killed cried ahab closely advancing how was it it seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous while three of the stranger s boats were engaged with a shoalof whales which had led them some four or five miles from the ship and while they were yet in swift chase to windward the white humpand head of moby dick had suddenly loomed up out of the blue water not very far to leeward whereupon the fourth rigged boat a reserved one had been instantly lowered in chase after a keen sail before the wind this fourth boat the swiftestkeeled of all seemed to have succeeded in fastening at least as well as the man at the mast head could tell anything about it in the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat and then a swiftgleam of bubbling white water and after that nothing more whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must haveindefinitely run away with his pursuers as often happens there was some apprehension but no positive alarm as yet the recall signals were placed in the rigging darkness came on and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats ere goingin quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction the ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boatto its fate till near midnight but for the time to increaseher distance from it but the rest of her crew being at lastsafe aboard she crowded all sail stunsail on stunsail after the missing boat kindling a fire in her try pots for a beacon and every other man aloft on the look out but though when shehad thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed placeof the absent ones when last seen though she then paused to lowerher spare boats to pull all around her and not finding anything had again dashed on again paused and lowered her boats and though she had thus continued doing till daylight yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen the story told the stranger captain immediately went on to revealhis object in boarding the pequod he desired that ship to unitewith his own in the search by sailing over the sea some four or fivemiles apart on parallel lines and so sweeping a double horizon as it were i will wager something now whispered stubb to flask that some onein that missing boat wore off that captain s best coat mayhap his watch he s so cursed anxious to get it back who ever heard of two piouswhale ships cruising after one missing whale boat in the heightof the whaling season see flask only see how pale he looks pale in the very buttons of his eyes look it wasn t the coat it must have been the my boy my own boy is among them for god s sake i beg i conjure here exclaimed the stranger captain to ahab who thus far had buticily received his petition for eight and forty hours let mecharter your ship i will gladly pay for it and roundly pay for it if there be no other way for eight and forty hours only only that you must oh you must and you shall do this thing his son cried stubb oh it s his son he s lost i take back the coat and watch what says ahab we mustsave that boy he s drowned with the rest on em last night said the old manxsailor standing behind them i heard all of ye heard their spirits now as it shortly turned out what made this incident of the rachel sthe more melancholy was the circumstance that not only was oneof the captain s sons among the number of the missing boat s crew but among the number of the other boats crews at the same time but on the other hand separated from the ship during the darkvicissitudes of the chase there had been still another son as that for a time the wretched father was plunged to the bottomof the cruellest perplexity which was only solved for himby his chief mate s instinctively adopting the ordinary procedureof a whaleship in such emergencies that is when placed betweenjeopardized but divided boats always to pick up the majority first but the captain for some unknown constitutional reason had refrained from mentioning all this and not till forced to itby ahab s iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy a little lad but twelve years old whose father with the earnestbut unmisgiving hardihood of a nantucketer s paternal love had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wondersof a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race nor does it unfrequently occur that nantucket captains willsend a son of such tender age away from them for a protractedthree or four years voyage in some other ship than their own so that their first knowledge of a whaleman s career shallbe unenervated by any chance display of a father s naturalbut untimely partiality or undue apprehensiveness and concern meantime now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of ahab and ahab still stood like an anvil receiving every shock but withoutthe least quivering of his own i will not go said the stranger till you say aye to me do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case for you too have a boy captain ahab though but a child and nestling safely at home now a child of your old age too yes yes you relent i see it run run men now and standby to square in the yards avast cried ahab touch not a rope yarn then in a voice thatprolongingly moulded every word captain gardiner i will not do it even now i lose time good bye good bye god bless ye man and may iforgive myself but i must go mr starbuck look at the binnacle watch and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers then brace forward again and let the ship sail as before hurriedly turning with averted face he descended intohis cabin leaving the strange captain transfixed at thisunconditional and utter rejection of his so earnest suit but starting from his enchantment gardiner silently hurriedto the side more fell than stepped into his boat and returnedto his ship soon the two ships diverged their wakes and long as the strangevessel was in view she was seen to yaw hither and thither at everydark spot however small on the sea this way and that her yardswere swung around starboard and larboard she continued to tack now she beat against a head sea and again it pushed her before it while all the while her masts and yards were thickly clusteredwith men as three tall cherry trees when the boys are cherryingamong the boughs but by her still halting course and winding woeful way you plainly sawthat this ship that so wept with spray still remained without comfort she was rachel weeping for her children because they were not chapter the cabin ahab moving to go on deck pip catches him by the hand to follow lad lad i tell thee thou must not follow ahab now the hour is coming when ahab would not scare thee from him yet would not have thee by him there is that in thee poor lad which i feel too

hatand now that at the proper time and place after so long and widea preliminary cruise ahab all other whaling waters swept seemed to have chased his foe into an oceanfold to slay himthe more securely there now that he found himself hardby the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting woundhad been inflicted now that a vessel had been spoken which onthe very day preceding had actually encountered moby dick and now that all his successive meetings with various shipscontrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with whichthe white whale tore his hunters whether sinning or sinned against now it was that there lurked a something in the old man s eyes which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see as the unsetting polar star which through the livelong arctic six months night sustains its piercing steady central gaze so ahab s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constantmidnight of the gloomy crew it domineered above them so that all their bodings doubts misgivings fears were fainto hide beneath their souls and not sprout forth a singlespear or leaf in this foreshadowing interval too all humor forcedor natural vanished stubb no more strove to raise a smile starbuck no more strove to check one alike joy and sorrow hope and fear seemed ground to finest dust and powdered for the time in the clamped mortar of ahab s iron soul like machines they dumbly moved about the deck ever consciousthat the old man s despot eye was on them but did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidentialhours when he thought no glance but one was on him then you would have seen that even as ahab s eyes so awedthe crew s the inscrutable parsee s glance awed his or somehow at least in some wild way at times affected it such an added gliding strangeness began to invest the thinfedallah now such ceaseless shudderings shook him that the men looked dubious at him half uncertain as it seemed whether indeed he were a mortal substance or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseenbeing s body and that shadow was always hovering there for not by night even had fedallah ever certainly been knownto slumber or go below he would stand still for hours but never sat or leaned his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say we two watchmen never rest nor at any time by night or day could the marinersnow step upon the deck unless ahab was before them either standing in his pivot hole or exactly pacing the planksbetween two undeviating limits the main mast and the mizen or else they saw him standing in the cabin scuttle his livingfoot advanced upon the deck as if to step his hat slouchedheavily over his eyes so that however motionless he stood however the days and nights were added on that he had notswung in his hammock yet hidden beneath that slouching hat they could never tell unerringly whether for all this his eyeswere really closed at times or whether he was still intentlyscanning them no matter though he stood so in the scuttlefor a whole hour on the stretch and the unheeded night dampgathered in beads of dew upon that stone carved coat and hat the clothes that the night had wet the next day s sunshinedried upon him and so day after day and night after night he went no more beneath the planks whatever he wanted fromthe cabin that thing he sent for he ate in the same open air that is his two only meals breakfast and dinner supper he never touched nor reapedhis beard which darkly grew all gnarled as unearthed rootsof trees blown over which still grow idly on at naked base though perished in the upper verdure but though his wholelife was now become one watch on deck and though the parsee smystic watch was without intermission as his own yet these twonever seemed to speak one man to the other unless at longintervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain openly and to the awe struck crew they seemed pole like asunder if by day they chanced to speak one word by night dumb menwere both so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange at times for longest hours without a single hail they stoodfar parted in the starlight ahab in his scuttle the parseeby the main mast but still fixedly gazing upon each other as if in the parsee ahab saw his forethrown shadow in ahabthe parsee his abandoned substance and yet somehow did ahab in his own proper self as daily hourly and every instant commandingly revealed to his subordinates ahab seemed an independent lord the parsee but his slave still again both seemed yoked together and an unseentyrant driving them the lean shade siding the solid rib for be this parsee what he may all rib and keel was solid ahab at the first faintest glimmering of the dawn his iron voice washeard from aft man the mast heads and all through the day till after sunset and after twilight the same voice every hour at the striking of the helmsman s bell was heard what d ye see sharp sharp sharp but when three or four days had slided by after meetingthe children seeking rachel and no spout had yet been seen the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew s fidelity at least of nearly all except the pagan harpooneers he seemedto doubt even whether stubb and flask might not willingly overlookthe sight he sought but if these suspicions were really his he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them however his actions might seem to hint them i will have the first sight of the whale myself he said aye ahab must have the doubloon and withhis own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines and sending a hand aloft with a single sheaved block to secure to the mainmast head he received the two ends ofthe downwardreeved rope and attaching one to his basket prepareda pin for the other end in order to fasten it at the rail this done with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin he looked round upon his crew sweeping from one to the other pausing his glance long upon daggoo queequeg tashtego but shunning fedallah and then settling his firm relying eyeupon the chief mate said take the rope sir i give it intothy hands starbuck then arranging his person in the basket he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch starbuck beingthe one who secured the rope at last and afterwards stood near it and thus with one hand clinging round the royal mast ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles ahead astern this side and that within the wide expanded circle commandedat so great a height when in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated placein the rigging which chances to afford no foothold the sailorat sea is hoisted up to that spot and sustained there by the rope under these circumstances its fastened end on deck is always givenin strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it because in such a wilderness of running rigging whose variousdifferent relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discernedby what is seen of them at the deck and when the deck ends of theseropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings it would be but a natural fatality if unprovided with aconstant watchman the hoisted sailor should by some carelessnessof the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea so ahab s proceedings in this matter were not unusual the only strange thing about them seemed to be that starbuck almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose himwith anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision one of those too whose faithfulness on the look out he had seemedto doubt somewhat it was strange that this was the very manhe should select for his watchman freely giving his whole lifeinto such an otherwise distrusted person s hands now the first time ahab was perched aloft ere he had been thereten minutes one of those red billed savage sea hawks which so oftenfly incommodiously close round the manned mast heads of whalemenin these latitudes one of these birds came wheeling and screaminground his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air then spiralized downwards and went eddying again round his head but with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird nor indeed would anyone else have marked it much it being no uncommon circumstance only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sortof cunning meaning in almost every sight your hat your hat sir suddenly cried the sicilian seaman who being posted at the mizen mast head stood directly behind ahab though somewhat lower than his level and with a deep gulfof air dividing them but already the sable wing was before the old man s eyes the long hooked bill at his head with a scream the blackhawk darted away with his prize an eagle flew thrice round tarquin s head removing his cap toreplace it and thereupon tanaquil his wife declared that tarquinwould be king of rome but only by the replacing of the capwas that omen accounted good ahab s hat was never restored the wild hawk flew on and on with it far in advance of the prow and at last disappeared while from the point of that disappearance a minute black spot was dimly discerned falling from that vastheight into the sea chapter the pequod meets the delightthe intense pequod sailed on the rolling waves and days went by the life buoy coffin still lightly swung and another ship most miserably misnamed the delight was descried as she drew nigh all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams called shears which in some whaling ships cross the quarter deckat the height of eight or nine feet serving to carry the spare unrigged or disabled boats upon the stranger s shears were beheld the shattered white ribs and some few splintered planks of what had once been a whale boat but you now saw through this wreck as plainly as you see throughthe peeled half unhinged and bleaching skeleton of a horse hast seen the white whale look replied the hollow cheeked captain from his taffrail and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck hast killed him the harpoon is not yet forged that will ever will do that answered the other sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock onthe deck whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busyin sewing together not forged and snatching perth s levelled iron from the crotch ahab held it out exclaiming look ye nantucketer here in thishand i hold his death tempered in blood and tempered by lightningare these barbs and i swear to temper them triply in that hot placebehind the fin where the white whale most feels his accursed life then god keep thee old man see st thou that pointing to the hammock i bury but one of five stout men who were alive only yesterday but were dead ere night only that one i bury the rest were buried before they died you sail upon their tomb then turning to his crew areye ready there place the plank then on the rail and liftthe body so then oh god advancing towards the hammockwith uplifted hands may the resurrection and the life brace forward up helm cried ahab like lightning to his men but the suddenly started pequod was not quick enough to escapethe sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea not so quick indeed but that some of the flying bubbles might havesprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism as ahab now glided from the dejected delight the strange life buoyhanging at the pequod s stern came into conspicuous relief ha yonder look yonder men cried a foreboding voice in her wake in vain oh ye strangers ye fly our sad burial ye but turn usyour taffrail to show us your coffin chapter the symphonyit was a clear steel blue day the firmaments of air and sea werehardly separable in that all pervading azure only the pensive airwas transparently pure and soft with a woman s look and the robustand man like sea heaved with long strong lingering swells as samson s chest in his sleep hither and thither on high glided the snow white wings of small unspeckled birds these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air but to and fro in the deeps far down in the bottomless blue rushed mighty leviathans sword fish and sharks and these werethe strong troubled murderous thinkings of the masculine sea but though thus contrasting within the contrast was only in shadesand shadows without those two seemed one it was only the sex as it were that distinguished them aloft like a royal czar and king the sun seemed giving thisgentle air to this bold and rolling sea even as bride to groom and at the girdling line of the horizon a soft and tremulous motion most seen here at the equator denoted the fond throbbing trust the loving alarms with which the poor bride gave her bosom away tied up and twisted gnarled and knotted with wrinkles haggardly firm and unyielding his eyes glowing like coals that still glow in the ashes of ruin untottering ahab stoodforth in the clearness of the morn lifting his splinteredhelmet of a brow to the fair girl s forehead of heaven oh immortal infancy and innocency of the azure invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us sweet childhood of air and sky how oblivious were ye of old ahab sclose coiled woe but so have i seen little miriam and martha laughing eyed elves heedlessly gambol around their old sire sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the margeof that burnt out crater of his brain slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle ahab leaned over the sideand watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity but the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel for a moment the cankerous thing in his soul that glad happy air that winsome sky did at last stroke and caress him the step mother world so long cruel forbidding now threwaffectionate arms round his stubborn neck and did seem to joyouslysob over him as if over one that however wilful and erring she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless from beneath his slouched hat ahab dropped a tear into the sea nor did all the pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop starbuck saw the old man saw him how he heavily leaned over the side and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measurelesssobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around careful not to touch him or be noticed by him he yet drew nearto him and stood there ahab turned starbuck sir oh starbuck it is a mild mild wind and a mild looking sky on such a day very much such a sweetness as this i struckmy first whale a boy harpooneer of eighteen forty forty forty years ago ago forty years of continual whaling fortyyears of privation and peril and storm time forty years onthe pitiless sea for forty years has ahab forsaken the peaceful land for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep aye and yes starbuck out of those forty years i have notspent three ashore when i think of this life i have led the desolation of solitude it has been the masoned walled town ofa captain s exclusiveness which admits but small entrance to anysympathy from the green country without oh weariness heaviness guinea coast slavery of solitary command when i think of all this only half suspected not so keenly known to me before and how for forty years i have fed upon dry salted fare fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soul when the poorestlandsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand and brokenthe world s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts away whole oceans away from that young girl wife i wedded past fifty and sailed forcape horn the next day leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow wife wife rather a widow with her husband alive aye i widowedthat poor girl when i married her starbuck and then the madness the frenzy the boiling blood and the smoking brow with which for a thousand lowerings old ahab has furiously foamingly chased his prey more a demon than a man aye aye whata forty years fool fool old fool has old ahab been why this strife of the chase why weary and palsy the armat the oar and the iron and the lance how the richeror better is ahab now behold oh starbuck is it not hard that with this weary load i bear one poor leg should have beensnatched from under me here brush this old hair aside it blinds me that i seem to weep locks so grey did never growbut from out some ashes but do i look very old so very very old starbuck i feel deadly faint bowed and humped as though i were adam staggering beneath the piled centuriessince paradise god god god crack my heart stave my brain mockery mockery bitter biting mockery of grey hairs have i livedenough joy to wear ye and seem and feel thus intolerably old close stand close to me starbuck let me look

no stay on board on board lower not when i do when brandedahab gives chase to moby dick that hazard shall not be thine no no not with the far away home i see in that eye oh my captain my captain noble soul grand old heart after all why should any one give chase to that hated fish away with me let us fly these deadly waters let us home wife and child too are starbuck s wife and child ofhis brotherly sisterly play fellow youth even as thine sir are the wife and child of thy loving longing paternal old age away let us away this instant let me alter the course how cheerily how hilariously o my captain would we bowlon our way to see old nantucket again i think sir they havesome such mild blue days even as this in nantucket they have they have i have seen them some summer daysin the morning about this time yes it is his noon nap now the boy vivaciously wakes sits up in bed and his mother tellshim of me of cannibal old me how i am abroad upon the deep but will yet come back to dance him again tis my mary my mary herself she promised that my boy every morning should be carried to the hill to catch the firstglimpse of his father s sail yes yes no more it is done we head for nantucket come my captain study out the course and let us away see see the boy s face from the window the boy s hand on the hill but ahab s glance was averted like a blighted fruit tree he shook and cast his last cindered apple to the soil what is it what nameless inscrutable unearthly thing is it what cozening hidden lord and master and cruel remorseless emperorcommands me that against all natural lovings and longings i so keep pushing and crowding and jamming myself on all the time recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper natural heart i durst not so much as dare is ahab ahab is it i god or who that lifts this arm but if the great sun move not of himself but is as an errand boy in heaven nor one single star can revolve but by some invisible power how then can this one small heart beat this one small brain think thoughts unless god does that beating does that thinking does that living and not i by heaven man we are turned round and round in this world like yonder windlass and fate is the handspike and all the time lo that smiling sky and this unsounded sea look see yon albicore who put it into himto chase and fang that flying fish where do murderers go man who s to doom when the judge himself is dragged to the bar but it is a mild mild wind and a mild looking sky and the airssmells now as if it blew from a far away meadow they have been makinghay somewhere under the slopes of the andes starbuck and the mowersare sleeping among the new mown hay sleeping aye toil we howwe may we all sleep at last on the field sleep aye and rustamid greenness as last year s scythes flung down and leftin the half cut swarths starbuck but blanched to a corpse s hue with despair the mate had stolen away ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side but started at two reflected fixed eyes in the water there fedallah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail chapter the chase first daythat night in the mid watch when the old man as his wontat intervals stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned and went to his pivot hole he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship s dog will in drawingnigh to some barbarous isle he declared that a whale must be near soon that peculiar odor sometimes to a great distance givenforth by the living sperm whale was palpable to all the watch nor was any mariner surprised when after inspecting the compass and then the dog vane and then ascertaining the precise bearingof the odor as nearly as possible ahab rapidly ordered the ship scourse to be slightly altered and the sail to be shortened the acute policy dictating these movements was sufficientlyvindicated at daybreak by the sight of a long sleekon the sea directly and lengthwise ahead smooth as oil and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it the polished metallic like marks of some swift tide rip atthe mouth of a deep rapid stream man the mast heads call all hands thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes onthe forecastle deck daggoo roused the sleepers with suchjudgment claps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle so instantaneously did they appear with their clothesin their hands what d ye see cried ahab flattening his face to the sky nothing nothing sir was the sound hailing down in reply t gallant sails stunsails alow and aloft and on both sides all sail being set he now cast loose the life line reservedfor swaying him to the main royal mast head and in a few momentsthey were hoisting him thither when while but two thirdsof the way aloft and while peering ahead through the horizontalvacancy between the main top sail and top gallant sail he raiseda gull like cry in the air there she blows there she blows a hump like a snow hill it is moby dick fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the threelook outs the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famouswhale they had so long been pursuing ahab had now gainedhis final perch some feet above the other look outs tashtegostanding just beneath him on the cap of the top gallant mast so that the indian s head was almost on a level with ahab s heel from this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air to the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout theyhad so long ago beheld in the moonlit atlantic and indian oceans and did none of ye see it before cried ahab hailing the perchedmen all around him i saw him almost that same instant sir that captain ahab did and i cried out said tashtego not the same instant not the same no the doubloon is mine fate reserved the doubloon for me i only none of ye could haveraised the white whale first there she blows there she blows there she blows there she blows there again there again he cried in long drawn lingering methodic tones attuned to the gradualprolongings of the whale s visible jets he s going to sound in stunsails down top gallant sails stand by three boats mr starbuck remember stay on board and keep the ship helm there luff luff a point so steady man steady there go flukes no no only black water all ready the boats there stand by stand by lower me mr starbuck lower lower quick quicker and he slidthrough the air to the deck he is heading straight to leeward sir cried stubb right awayfrom us cannot have seen the ship yet be dumb man stand by the braces hard down the helm brace up shiver her shiver her so well that boats boats soon all the boats but starbuck s were dropped all the boat sails set all the paddles plying with rippling swiftness shooting to leeward and ahab heading the onset a pale death glimmer lit up fedallah ssunken eyes a hideous motion gnawed his mouth like noiseless nautilus shells their light prows sped through the sea but only slowly they neared the foe as they neared him the ocean grewstill more smooth seemed drawing a carpet over its waves seemed anoon meadow so serenely it spread at length the breathless hunter cameso nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey that his entire dazzling humpwas distinctly visible sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing and continually set in a revolving ring of finest fleecy greenish foam he saw the vast involved wrinkles of the slightly projectinghead beyond before it far out on the soft turkish rugged waters went the glistening white shadow from his broad milky forehead a musicalrippling playfully accompanying the shade and behind the blue watersinterchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side but these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gayfowls softly feathering the sea alternate with their fitful flight and like to some flag staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the whitewhale s back and at intervals one of the cloud of soft toedfowls hovering and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish silently perched and rocked on this pole the long tail feathersstreaming like pennons a gentle joyousness a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness invested the gliding whale not the white bull jupiter swimmingaway with ravished europa clinging to his graceful horns his lovely leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid with smooth bewitching fleetness rippling straight for the nuptialbower in crete not jove not that great majesty supreme didsurpass the glorified white whale as he so divinely swam on each soft side coincident with the parted swell that but once leaving him then flowed so wide away on eachbright side the whale shed off enticings no wonder therehad been some among the hunters who namelessly transportedand allured by all this serenity had ventured to assail it but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of tornadoes yet calm enticing calm oh whale thou glidest on to allwho for the first time eye thee no matter how many in that sameway thou mayst have bejuggled and destroyed before and thus through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea among waves whose hand clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture moby dick moved on still withholding from sight the full terrors of hissubmerged trunk entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw but soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch like virginia s natural bridge and warningly waving his banneredflukes in the air the grand god revealed himself sounded and wentout of sight hoveringly halting and dipping on the wing the white sea fowls longingly lingered over the agitated poolthat he left with oars apeak and paddles down the sheets of their sails adrift the three boats now stilly floated awaiting moby dick s reappearance an hour said ahab standing rooted in his boat s stern and he gazedbeyond the whale s place towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooingvacancies to leeward it was only an instant for again his eyesseemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle the breeze now freshened the sea began to swell the birds the birds cried tashtego in long indian file as when herons take wing the white birdswere now all flying towards ahab s boat and when within a fewyards began fluttering over the water there wheeling roundand round with joyous expectant cries their vision waskeener than man s ahab could discover no sign in the sea but suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths he profoundlysaw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel with wonderfulcelerity uprising and magnifying as it rose till it turned and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white glistening teeth floating up from the undiscoverable bottom it was moby dick s open mouth and scrolled jaw his vast shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea the glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open dooredmarble tomb and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition then calling upon fedallah to change places with him went forwardto the bows and seizing perth s harpoon commanded his crewto grasp their oars and stand by to stern now by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis its bow by anticipation was made to face the whale s headwhile yet under water but as if perceiving this stratagem moby dick with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him sidelingly transplanted himself as it were in an instant shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat through and through through every plank and each rib it thrilled for an instant the whale obliquely lying on his back in the manner of a biting shark slowly and feelingly takingits bows full within his mouth so that the long narrow scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air and oneof the teeth caught in a row lock the bluish pearl whiteof the inside of the jaw was within six inches of ahab s head and reached higher than that in this attitude the white whalenow shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse with unastonished eyes fedallah gazed and crossed his arms but the tiger yellow crew were tumbling over each other s headsto gain the uttermost stern and now while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way and from his body being submerged beneath the boat he could not bedarted at from the bows for the bows were almost inside of him as it were and while the other boats involuntarily paused as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand then it was thatmonomaniac ahab furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated frenzied with all this he seized the long bone with hisnaked hands and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe as now he thus vainly strove the jaw slipped from him the frail gunwales bent in collapsed and snapped as both jaws like an enormous shears sliding further aft bit the craft completely in twain and locked themselves fastagain in the sea midway between the two floating wrecks these floated aside the broken ends drooping the crew atthe stern wreck clinging to the gunwales and striving to holdfast to the oars to lash them across at that preluding moment ere the boat was yet snapped ahab the firstto perceive the whale s intent by the crafty upraising of his head a movement that loosed his hold for the time at that moment hishand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite but only slipping further into the whale s mouth and tilting oversideways as it slipped the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw spilled him out of it as he leaned to the push and so he fellflat faced upon the sea ripplingly withdrawing from his prey moby dick now lay at alittle distance vertically thrusting his oblong white head upand down in the billows and at the same time slowly revolving hiswhole spindled body so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose some twenty or more feet out of the water the now rising swells with all their confluent waves dazzlingly broke against it vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher intothe air so in a gale the but half baffled channel billows onlyrecoil from the base of the eddystone triumphantly to overleapits summit with their scud this motion is peculiar to the sperm whale it receives its designation pitchpoling from its being likened to that preliminary up and downpoise of the whale lance in the exercise called pitchpoling previously described by this motion the whale must best and mostcomprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him but soon resuming his horizontal attitude moby dick swam swiftlyround and round the wrecked crew sideways churning the water in hisvengeful wake as if lashing himself up to still another and moredeadly assault the sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before antiochus selephants in the book of maccabees meanwhile ahab half smotheredin the foam of the whale s insolent tail and too much of a crippleto swim though he could still keep afloat even in the heartof such a whirlpool as that helpless ahab s head was seen like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst from the boat s fragmentary stern fedallah incuriously and mildlyeyed him the clinging crew at the other drifting end could notsuccor him more than enough was it for them to look to themselves for so revolvingly appalling was the white whale s aspect and so planetarily swift the ever contracting circleshe made that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them and though the other boats unharmed still hovered hard by still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike lest that should bethe signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways ahab and all nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape with straining eyes then they remained on the outer edge ofthe direful zone whose centre had now become the old man s head meantime from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship smast heads and squaring her yards she had borne down upon the scene and was now so nigh that ahab in the water hailed her sail on the but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from moby dick and whelmedhim for the time but struggling out of it again and chancing to riseon a towering crest he shouted sail on the whale drive him off the pequod s prows were pointed and breaking up the charmed circle she effectually parted the white whale from his victim as he sullenly swam off the boats flew to the rescue dragged into stubb s boat with blood shot blinded eyes the white brine caking in his wrinkles the long tensionof ahab s bodily strength did crack and helplessly he yieldedto his body s doom for a time lying all crushed in the bottomof stubb s boat like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants far inland nameless wails came from him as desolate soundsfrom out ravines but this intensity of his physical prostration did but so muchthe more abbreviate it in an instant s compass great heartssometimes condense to one deep pang the sum total of thoseshallow pains kindly diffused through feebler men s whole lives and so such hearts though summary in each one suffering still if the gods decree it in their life time aggregatea whole age of woe wholly made up of instantaneous intensities for even in their pointless centres those noble natures containthe entire circumferences of inferior souls the harpoon said ahab half way rising and draggingly leaningon one bended arm is it safe aye sir for it was not darted this is it said stubb showing it lay it before me any missing men one two three four five there were five oars sir and hereare five men that s good help me man i wish to stand so so i see him there there going to leeward still what a leaping spout hands off from me the eternal sap runs up in ahab s bones again set the sail out oars the helm it is often the case that when a boat is stove its crew being picked up by another boat help to work that second boat and the chase is thus continued with what is called double banked oars it was thus now but the added power of the boat did not equalthe added power of the whale for he seemed to have treble bankedhis every fin swimming with a velocity which plainly showed that if now under these circumstances pushed on the chasewould prove an indefinitely prolonged if not a hopeless one nor could any crew endure for so long a period such an unintermitted intense straining at the oar a thing barely tolerable only in some onebrief vicissitude the ship itself then as it sometimes happens offered the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase accordingly the boats now made for her and were soon swayed upto their cranes the two parts of the wrecked boat having beenpreviously secured by her and then hoisting everything to her side and stacking her canvas high up and sideways outstretching itwith stunsails like the double jointed wings of an albatross the pequod bore down in the leeward wake of moby dick at the well known methodic intervals the whale s glittering spout was regularlyannounced from the manned mast heads and when he would be reportedas just gone down ahab would take the time and then pacing the deck binnacle watch in hand so soon as the last second of the allottedhour expired his voice was heard whose is the doubloon now d ye see him and if the reply was no sir straightway he commandedthem to lift him to his perch in this way the day wore on ahab now aloft and motionless anon unrestingly pacing the planks as he was thus walking uttering no sound except to hail the men aloft or to bid them hoist a sail still higher or to spread one to a stillgreater breadth thus to and fro pacing beneath his slouched hat at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat which had been dropped uponthe quarter deck and lay there reversed broken bow to shattered stern at last he paused before it and as in an already over clouded sky freshtroops of clouds will sometimes sail across so over the old man s facethere now stole some such added gloom as this stubb saw him pause and perhaps intending not vainly though to evince his own unabated fortitude and thus keep up a valiant placein his captain s mind he advanced and eyeing the wreck exclaimed the thistle the ass refused it pricked his mouth too keenly sir ha ha ha what soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck man man did i not know thee brave as fearless fire and as mechanical i could swear thou wert a poltroon groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck aye sir said starbuck drawing near tis a solemn sight an omen and an ill one omen omen the dictionary if the gods think to speak outrightto man they will honorably speak outright not shake their heads and give an old wives darkling hint begone ye two arethe opposite poles of one thing starbuck is stubb reversed and stubb is starbuck and ye two are all mankind and ahab standsalone among the millions of the peopled earth nor gods nor menhis neighbors cold cold i shiver how now aloft there d ye see him sing out for every spout though he spout tentimes a second the day was nearly done only the hem of his golden robe was rustling soon it was almost dark but the look out men still remained unset can t see the spout now sir too dark cried a voice from the air how heading when last seen as before sir straight to leeward good he will travel slower now tis night down royals andtop gallant stunsails mr starbuck we must not run over himbefore morning he s making a passage now and may heave to a while helm there keep her full before the wind aloft come down mr stubb send a fresh hand to the fore mast head and seeit manned till morning then advancing towards the doubloonin the main mast men this gold is mine for i earned it but i shall let it abide here till the white whale is dead and then whosoever of ye first raises him upon the day he shallbe killed this gold is that man s and if on that day i shall againraise him then ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye away now the deck is thine sir and so saying he placed himself half way within the scuttle and slouching his hat stood there till dawn except when atintervals rousing himself to see how the night wore on chapter the chase second dayat day break the three mast heads were punctually manned afresh d ye see him cried ahab after allowing a little spacefor the light to spread see nothing sir turn up all hands and make sail he travels faster than i thought for the top gallant sails aye they should have been kept on her all night but no matter tis but resting for the rush here be it said that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale continued through day into night and through night into day is a thing by no means unprecedented in the south sea fishery for such is the wonderful skill prescience of experience and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses amongthe nantucket commanders that from the simple observation of a whalewhen last descried they will under certain given circumstances pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continueto swim for a time while out of sight as well as his probablerate of progression during that period and in these cases somewhat as a pilot when about losing sight of a coast whose generaltrending he well knows and which he desires shortly to return to again but at some further point like as this pilot stands by his compass and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote unseen headland eventually to be visited so does the fisherman at his compass with the whale for after being chased and diligently marked through several hours of daylight then when night obscuresthe fish the creature s future wake through the darkness is almostas established to the sagacious mind of the hunter as the pilot scoast is to him so that to this hunter s wondrous skill the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water a wake is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land and as the mighty iron leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarlyknown in its every pace that with watches in their hands men timehis rate as doctors that of a baby s pulse and lightly say of it the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot at such or such an hour even so almost there are occasionswhen these nantucketers time that other leviathan of the deep according to the observed humor of his speed and say to themselves so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude but to render this acuteness at all successful in the end the windand the sea must be the whaleman s allies for of what present availto the becalmed or wind bound mariner is the skill that assures himhe is exactly ninety three leagues and a quarter from his port inferable from these statements are many collateral subtile matterstouching the chase of whales the ship tore on leaving such a furrow in the sea as whena cannonball missent becomes a plough share and turns upthe level field by salt and hemp cried stubb but this swift motion of the deckcreeps up one s legs and tingles at the heart this ship and iare two brave fellows ha ha some one take me up and launch me spine wise on the sea for by live oaks my spine s a keel ha ha we go the gait that leaves no dust behind there she blows she blows she blows right ahead was now the mast head cry aye aye cried stubb i knew it ye can t escape blow on and splityour spout o whale the mad fiend himself is after ye blow your trump blister your lungs ahab will dam off your blood as a miller shutshis watergate upon the stream and stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew the frenzies of the chase had by this time worked thembubblingly up like old wine worked anew whatever palefears and forebodings some of them might have felt before these were not only now kept out of sight through the growingawe of ahab but they were broken up and on all sides routed as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison the hand of fate had snatched all their souls and by the stirringperils of the previous day the rack of the past night s suspense the fixed unfearing blind reckless way in which their wildcraft went plunging towards its flying mark by all these things their hearts were bowled along the wind that made great belliesof their sails and rushed the vessel on by arms invisibleas irresistible this seemed the symbol of that unseen agencywhich so enslaved them to the race they were one man not thirty for as the one ship that held them all though it was put together of all contrasting things oak and maple and pine wood iron and pitch and hemp yet all these raninto each other in the one concrete hull which shot on its way both balanced and directed by the long central keel even so all the individualities of the crew this man s valor that man s fear guilt and guiltiness all varieties were welded into oneness and were all directed to that fatal goal which ahab their one lordand keel did point to the rigging lived the mast heads like the tops oftall palms were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs clinging to a spar with one hand some reached forth the otherwith impatient wavings others shading their eyes from thevivid sunlight sat far out on the rocking yards all the sparsin full bearing of mortals ready and ripe for their fate ah how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seekout the thing that might destroy them why sing ye not out for him if ye see him cried ahab when after thelapse of some minutes since the first cry no more had been heard sway me up men ye have been deceived not moby dick casts one oddjet that way and then disappears it was even so in their headlong eagerness the men had mistakensome other thing for the whale spout as the event itself soon proved for hardly had ahab reached his perch hardly was the rope belayedto its pin on deck when he struck the key note to an orchestra that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharge of rifles the triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard as much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet less than a mile ahead moby dick bodily burst into view for not by any calm and indolent spoutings not by the peaceable gushof that mystic fountain in his head did the white whale now revealhis vicinity but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths the sperm whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pureelement of air and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more in those moments the torn enraged waves he shakes off seem his mane in some cases this breaching is his act of defiance there she breaches there she breaches was the cry as in hisimmeasurable bravadoes the white whale tossed himself salmon liketo heaven so suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea and relievedagainst the still bluer margin of the sky the spray that he raised for the moment intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier and stood there gradually fading and fading away from its firstsparkling intensity to the dim mistiness of an advancing showerin a vale aye breach your last to the sun moby dick cried ahab thy hour andthy harpoon are at hand down down all of ye but one man at the fore the boats stand by unmindful of the tedious rope ladders of the shrouds the men like shooting stars slid to the deck by the isolated backstaysand halyards while ahab less dartingly but still rapidlywas dropped from his perch lower away he cried so soon as he had reached his boat a spare one rigged the afternoon previous mr starbuck the ship is thine keep away from the boats but keep near them lower all as if to strike a quick terror into them by this time beingthe first assailant himself moby dick had turned and was nowcoming for the three crews ahab s boat was central and cheeringhis men he told them he would take the whale head and head that is pull straight up to his forehead a not uncommon thing for when within a certain limit such a course excludesthe coming onset from the whale s sidelong vision but ere that close limit was gained and while yet allthree boats were plain as the ship s three masts to his eye the white whale churning himself into furious speed almost inan instant as it were rushing among the boats with open jaws and a lashing tail offered appalling battle on every side and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plankof which those boats were made but skilfully manoeuvred incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field the boats for a while eluded him though at times but by aplank s breadth while all the time ahab s unearthly slogantore every other cry but his to shreds but at last in his untraceable evolutions the white whale socrossed and recrossed and in a thousand ways entangled the slackof the three lines now fast to him that they foreshortened and of themselves warped the devoted boats towards the plantedirons in him though now for a moment the whale drew asidea little as if to rally for a more tremendous charge seizing that opportunity ahab first paid out more line and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls when lo a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks caught and twisted corkscrewed in the mazes of the line loose harpoons and lances with all their bristling barbs and points came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of ahab s boat only one thing could be done seizing the boat knife he criticallyreached within through and then without the rays of steel dragged in the line beyond passed it inboard to the bowsman and then twice sundering the rope near the chocks dropped theintercepted fagot of steel into the sea and was all fast again that instant the white whale made a sudden rush among the remainingtangles of the other lines by so doing irresistibly draggedthe more involved boats of stubb and flask towards his flukes dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surf beaten beach and then diving down into the sea disappeared in a boiling maelstrom in which for a space the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks dancedround and round like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirredbowl of punch while the two crews were yet circling in the waters reaching outafter the revolving line tubs oars and other floating furniture while aslope little flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks and stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up and while the old man s line now parting admitted of hispulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils ahab s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards heaven byinvisible wires as arrow like shooting perpendicularly from the sea the white whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom and sent it turning over and over into the air till it fell again gunwale downwards and ahab and his men struggled out from under it like seals from a sea side cave the first uprising momentum of the whale modifying its directionas he struck the surface involuntarily launched him along it to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made and with his back to it he now lay for a moment slowly feelingwith his flukes from side to side and whenever a stray oar bit of plank the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin his tail swiftly drew back and came sideways smiting the sea but soon as if satisfied that his work for that time was done he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean and trailingafter him the intertangled lines continued his leeward wayat a traveller s methodic pace as before the attentive ship having descried the whole fight again came bearing down to the rescue and dropping a boat picked up the floating mariners tubs oars and whatever elsecould be caught at and safely landed them on her decks some sprained shoulders wrists and ankles livid contusions wrenched harpoons and lances inextricable intricacies of rope shattered oars and planks all these were there but nofatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one as with fedallah the day before so ahab was now found grimly clingingto his boat s broken half which afforded a comparatively easy float nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day s mishap but when he was helped to the deck all eyes were fastened upon him as instead of standing by himself he still half hung upon the shoulderof starbuck who had thus far been the foremost to assist him his ivory leg had been snapped off leaving but one short sharp splinter aye aye starbuck tis sweet to lean sometimes be the leanerwho he will and would old ahab had leaned oftener than he has the ferrule has not stood sir said the carpenter now coming up i put good work into that leg but no bones broken sir i hope said stubb with true concern aye and all splintered to pieces stubb d ye see it but even with a broken bone old ahab is untouched and i accountno living bone of mine one jot more me than this dead onethat s lost nor white whale nor man nor fiend can so muchas graze old ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being can any lead touch yonder floor any mast scrape yonder roof aloft there which way dead to leeward sir up helm then pile on the sail again ship keepers downthe rest of the spare boats and rig them mr starbuck away and muster the boat s crews let me first help thee towards the bulwarks sir oh oh oh how this splinter gores me now accursed fate that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have sucha craven mate sir my body man not thee give me something for a cane there thatshivered lance will do muster the men surely i have not seen him yet by heaven it cannot be missing quick call them all the old man s hinted thought was true upon mustering the company the parsee was not there the parsee cried stubb he must have been caught in the black vomit wrench thee run all of ye above alow cabin forecastle find him not gone not gone but quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the parseewas nowhere to be found aye sir said stubb caught among the tangles of your line i thought i saw him dragging under my line my line gone gone what means that little word what death knell rings in it that old ahab shakes as if he werethe belfry the harpoon too toss over the litter there d ye see it the forged iron men the white whale s no no no blistered fool this hand did dart it tis in the fish aloft there keep him nailed quick all hands to the rigging of the boats collect the oars harpooneers the irons the irons hoist theroyals higher a pull on all the sheets helm there steady steady for your life i ll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe yea and dive straight through it but i ll slay him yet great god but for one single instant show thyself cried starbuck never never wilt thou capture him old man in jesus name no more of this that s worse than devil s madness two days chased twice stove to splinters thy very leg oncemore snatched from under thee thy evil shadow gone all goodangels mobbing thee with warnings what more wouldst thou have shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps the last man shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea shall we be towed by him to the infernal world oh oh impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more starbuck of late i ve felt strangely moved to thee ever sincethat hour we both saw thou know st what in one another s eyes but in this matter of the whale be the front of thy faceto me as the palm of this hand a lipless unfeatured blank ahab is for ever ahab man this whole act s immutably decreed twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before thisocean rolled fool i am the fates lieutenant i act under orders look thou underling that thou obeyest mine stand round men men ye see an old man cut down to the stump leaning on a shivered lance propped up on a lonely foot tis ahab his body s part but ahab s soul s a centipede that moves upon a hundred legs i feel strained half stranded as ropes that tow dismasted frigatesin a gale and i may look so but ere i break yell hear me crack and till ye hear that know that ahab s hawser tows his purpose yet believe ye men in the things called omens then laugh aloud and cry encore for ere they drown drowning things will twicerise to the surface then rise again to sink for evermore so with moby dick two days he s floated to morrow will be the third aye men he ll rise once more but only to spout his last d ye feel brave men brave as fearless fire cried stubb and as mechanical muttered ahab then as the men went forward he muttered on the things called omens and yesterday i talkedthe same to starbuck there concerning my broken boat oh how valiantlyi seek to drive out of others hearts what s clinched so fast in mine the parsee the parsee gone gone and he was to go before but still was to be seen again ere i could perish how s that there s a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghostsof the whole line of judges like a hawk s beak it pecks my brain i ll i ll solve it though when dusk descended the whale was still in sight to leeward so once more the sail was shortened and everything passednearly as on the previous night only the sound of hammers and the hum of the grindstone was heard till nearly daylight as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete and carefulrigging of the spare boats and sharpening their fresh weaponsfor the morrow meantime of the broken keel of ahab s wreckedcraft the carpenter made him another leg while still as onthe night before slouched ahab stood fixed within his scuttle his hid heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial sat due eastward for the earliest sun chapter the chase third daythe morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh and oncemore the solitary night man at the fore mast head was relievedby crowds of the daylight look outs who dotted every mastand almost every spar d ye see him cried ahab but the whale was not yet in sight in his infallible wake though but follow that wake that s all helm there steady as thou goest and hast been going what a lovely day again were it a new made world and made fora summer house to the angels and this morning the first of itsthrowing open to them a fairer day could not dawn upon that world here s food for thought had ahab time to think but ahab never thinks he only feels feels feels that s tingling enough for mortalman to think s audacity god only has that right and privilege thinking is or ought to be a coolness and a calmness and ourpoor hearts throb and our poor brains beat too much for that and yet i ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm frozen calm this old skull cracks so like a glass in whichthe contents turned to ice and shiver it and still this hairis growing now this moment growing and heat must breed it but no it s like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere between the earthy clefts of greenland ice or in vesuvius lava how the wild winds blow it they whip it about me as the tornshreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to a vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridorsand cells and wards of hospitals and ventilated them and now comesblowing hither as innocent as fleeces out upon it it s tainted were i the wind i d blow no more on such a wicked miserable world i d crawl somewhere to a cave and slink there and yet tis a noble and heroic thing the wind who ever conquered it in every fight it has the last and bitterest blow run tiltingat it and you but run through it ha a coward wind that strikesstark naked men but will not stand to receive a single blow even ahab is a braver thing a nobler thing than that would now the wind but had a body but all the things that mostexasperate and outrage mortal man all these things are bodiless but only bodiless as objects not as agents there s amost special a most cunning oh a most malicious difference and yet i say again and swear it now that there s somethingall glorious and gracious in the wind these warm trade winds at least that in the clear heavens blow straight on in strongand steadfast vigorous mildness and veer not from their mark however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack and mightiest mississippies of the land swift and swerve about uncertain where to go at last and by the eternal poles these same trades that so directly blow my good ship on these trades or something like them something so unchangeable and full as strong blow my keeled soul along to it aloft there what d ye see nothing sir nothing and noon at hand the doubloon goes a begging seethe sun aye aye it must be so i ve over sailed him how got the start aye he s chasing me now not i him that s bad i might have known it too fool the lines the harpoons he s towing aye aye i have run him by last night about about come down all of ye but the regular look outs man the braces steering as she had done the wind had been somewhat on thepequod s quarter so that now being pointed in the reverse direction the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurnedthe cream in her own white wake against the wind he now steers for the open jaw murmured starbuckto himself as he coiled the new hauled main brace upon the rail god keep us but already my bones feel damp within me and fromthe inside wet my flesh i misdoubt me that i disobey my godin obeying him stand by to sway me up cried ahab advancing to the hempen basket we should meet him soon aye aye sir and straightway starbuck did ahab s bidding and once more ahab swung on high a whole hour now passed gold beaten out to ages time itself now held long breaths with keen suspense but at last some three points off the weather bow ahab descriedthe spout again and instantly from the three mast headsthree shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it forehead to forehead i meet thee this third time moby dick on deck there brace sharper up crowd her into the wind s eye he s too far off to lower yet mr starbuck the sails shake stand over that helmsman with a top maul so so he travels fast and i must down but let me have one more good round look alofthere at the sea there s time for that an old old sight and yetsomehow so young aye and not changed a wink since i first saw it a boy from the sand hills of nantucket the same the same the same to noah as to me there s a soft shower to leeward such lovely leewardings they must lead somewhere to something else than common land more palmy than the palms leeward the white whale goes that way look to windward then the better if the bitterer quarter but good bye good bye old mast head what s this green aye tiny mosses in thesewarped cracks no such green weather stains on ahab s head there s the difference now between man s old age and matter s but aye old mast we both grow old together sound in our hulls though are we not my ship aye minus a leg that s all by heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way i can t compare with it and i ve known some ships made of dead treesoutlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers what s that he said he should still go before me my pilot and yet to be seen again but where will i have eyes atthe bottom of the sea supposing i descend those endless stairs and all night i ve been sailing from him wherever he did sink to aye aye like many more thou told st direful truth astouching thyself o parsee but ahab there thy shot fell short good bye mast head keep a good eye upon the whale the while i m gone we ll talk to morrow nay to night when the white whale liesdown there tied by head and tail he gave the word and still gazing round him was steadily loweredthrough the cloven blue air to the deck in due time the boats were lowered but as standing in hisshallop s stern ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent he waved to the mate who held one of the tackle ropes on deck and bade him pause starbuck sir for the third time my soul s ship starts upon this voyage starbuck aye sir thou wilt have it so some ships sail from their ports and ever afterwardsare missing starbuck truth sir saddest truth some men die at ebb tide some at low water some at the fullof the flood and i feel now like a billow that s all onecrested comb starbuck i am old shake hands with me man their hands met their eyes fastened starbuck s tears the glue oh my captain my captain noble heart go not go not see it s abrave man that weeps how great the agony of the persuasion then lower away cried ahab tossing the mate s arm from him stand by for the crew in an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern the sharks the sharks cried a voice from the low cabin window there o master my master come back but ahab heard nothing for his own voice was high lifted then and the boat leaped on yet the voice spake true for scarce had he pushed from the ship when numbers of sharks seemingly rising from out the dark watersbeneath the hull maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars every time they dipped in the water and in this way accompaniedthe boat with their bites it is a thing not uncommonly happeningto the whale boats in those swarming seas the sharks at timesapparently following them in the same prescient way that vultureshover over the banners of marching regiments in the east but these were the first sharks that had been observed by the pequodsince the white whale had been first descried and whether itwas that ahab s crew were all such tiger yellow barbarians and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks a matter sometimes well known to affect them however it was they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others heart of wrought steel murmured starbuck gazing over the side and following with his eyes the receding boat canst thouyet ring boldly to that sight lowering thy keel amongravening sharks and followed by them open mouthed to the chase and this the critical third day for when three daysflow together in one continuous intense pursuit be surethe first is the morning the second the noon and the thirdthe evening and the end of that thing be that end what it may oh my god what is this that shoots through me and leaves meso deadly calm yet expectant fixed at the top of a shudder future things swim before me as in empty outlines and skeletons all the past is somehow grown dim mary girl thou fadestin pale glories behind me boy i seem to see but thy eyesgrown wondrous blue strangest problems of life seem clearing but clouds sweep between is my journey s end coming my legs feel faint like his who has footed it all day feel thy heart beats it yet stir thyself starbuck stave it off move move speak aloud mast head there see ye my boy s hand on the hill crazed aloft there keep thy keenest eye upon the boats mark well the whale ho again drive off that hawk see he pecks he tears the vane pointing to the red flag flying at the main truck ha he soarsaway with it where s the old man now see st thou that sight oh ahab shudder shudder the boats had not gone very far when by a signal from the mast heads a downward pointed arm ahab knew that the whale had sounded but intending to be near him at the next rising he held on his waya little sideways from the vessel the becharmed crew maintainingthe profoundest silence as the head bent waves hammered and hammeredagainst the opposing bow drive drive in your nails oh ye waves to their uttermostheads drive them in ye but strike a thing without a lid and no coffin and no hearse can be mine and hemp only cankill me ha ha suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles then quickly upheaved as if sideways sliding from a submergedberg of ice swiftly rising to the surface a low rumbling soundwas heard a subterraneous hum and then all held their breaths as bedraggled with trailing ropes and harpoons and lances a vast form shot lengthwise but obliquely from the sea shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist it hovered for a momentin the rainbowed air and then fell swamping back into the deep crushed thirty feet upwards the waters flashed for an instantlike heaps of fountains then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marbletrunk of the whale give way cried ahab to the oarsmen and the boats darted forward tothe attack but maddened by yesterday s fresh irons that corroded in him moby dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fellfrom heaven the wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broadwhite forehead beneath the transparent skin looked knitted together as head on he came churning his tail among the boats and once moreflailed them apart spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates boats and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows but leaving ahab s almost without a scar while daggoo and queequeg were stopping the strained planks and as the whale swimming out from them turned and showedone entire flank as he shot by them again at that momenta quick cry went up lashed round and round to the fish s back pinioned in the turns upon turns in which during the past night the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him the half torn body of the parsee was seen his sable raimentfrayed to shreds his distended eyes turned full upon old ahab the harpoon dropped from his hand befooled befooled drawing in a long lean breath aye parsee i seethee again aye and thou goest before and this this then is the hearsethat thou didst promise but i hold thee to the last letter of thy word where is the second hearse away mates to the ship those boatsare useless now repair them if ye can in time and return to me if not ahab is enough to die down men the first thing that butoffers to jump from this boat i stand in that thing i harpoon ye are not other men but my arms and my legs and so obey me where s the whale gone down again but he looked too nigh the boat for as if bent upon escapingwith the corpse he bore and as if the particular place of the lastencounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage moby dickwas now again steadily swimming forward and had almost passedthe ship which thus far had been sailing in the contrary directionto him though for the present her headway had been stopped he seemed swimming with his utmost velocity and now only intentupon pursuing his own straight path in the sea oh ahab cried starbuck not too late is it even now the third day to desist see moby dick seeks thee not it is thou thou that madly seekest him setting sail to the rising wind the lonely boat wasswiftly impelled to leeward by both oars and canvas and at last when ahab was sliding by the vessel so nearas plainly to distinguish starbuck s face as he leanedover the rail he hailed him to turn the vessel about and follow him not too swiftly at a judicious interval glancing upwards he saw tashtego queequeg and daggoo eagerly mounting to the three mast heads while the oarsmenwere rocking in the two staved boats which had but just beenhoisted to the side and were busily at work in repairing them one after the other through the port holes as he sped he also caught flying glimpses of stubb and flask busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances as he saw all this as he heard the hammers in the broken boats far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart but he rallied and now marking that the vane or flagwas gone from the main mast head he shouted to tashtego who had just gained that perch to descend again for another flag and a hammer and nails and so nail it to the mast whether fagged by the three days running chase and theresistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him whichever was true the white whale s way now began to abate as it seemed from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more though indeed the whale s last start had not been so long a oneas before and still as ahab glided over the waves the unpityingsharks accompanied him and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat and so continually bit at the plying oars that the bladesbecame jagged and crunched and left small splinters in the sea at almost every dip heed them not those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars pull on tis the better rest the sharks jaw than the yielding water but at every bite sir the thin blades grow smaller and smaller they will last long enough pull on but who can tell he muttered whether these sharks swim to feast on the whaleor on ahab but pull on aye all alive now we near him the helm take the helm let me pass and so saying two of theoarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat at length as the craft was cast to one side and ran rangingalong with the white whale s flank he seemed strangelyoblivious of its advance as the whale sometimes will and ahabwas fairly within the smoky mountain mist which thrown offfrom the whale s spout curled round his great monadnock hump he was even thus close to him when with body arched back and both arms lengthwise high lifted to the poise he dartedhis fierce iron and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale as both steel and curse sank to the socket as if sucked intoa morass moby dick sideways writhed spasmodically rolledhis nigh flank against the bow and without staving a holein it so suddenly canted the boat over that had it not beenfor the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea as it was three of the oarsmen who foreknew not the preciseinstant of the dart and were therefore unprepared for its effects these were flung out but so fell that in an instant twoof them clutched the gunwale again and rising to its level ona combing wave hurled themselves bodily inboard again the thirdman helplessly dropping astern but still afloat and swimming almost simultaneously with a mighty volition of ungraduated instantaneous swiftness the white whale darted through theweltering sea but when ahab cried out to the steersman to takenew turns with the line and hold it so and commanded the crewto turn round on their seats and tow the boat up to the mark the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug it snapped in the empty air what breaks in me some sinew cracks tis whole again oars oars burst in upon him hearing the tremendous rush of the sea crashing boat the whalewheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay but inthat evolution catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions bethinking it it may be a larger and nobler foe of a sudden he bore down upon its advancing prow smiting his jaws amid fieryshowers of foam ahab staggered his hand smote his forehead i grow blind hands stretch out before me that i may yet grope my way is t night the whale the ship cried the cringing oarsmen oars oars slope downwards to thy depths o sea that ereit be for ever too late ahab may slide this last last timeupon his mark i see the ship the ship dash on my men will ye not save my ship but as the oarsmen violently forced their boat throughthe sledge hammering seas the before whale smitten bow endsof two planks burst through and in an instant almost the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves its half wading splashing crew trying hard to stop the gapand bale out the pouring water meantime for that one beholding instant tashtego s mast headhammer remained suspended in his hand and the red flag half wrapping him as with a plaid then streamed itselfstraight out from him as his own forward flowing heart while starbuck and stubb standing upon the bowsprit beneath caught sight of the down coming monster just as soon as he the whale the whale up helm up helm oh all ye sweet powersof air now hug me close let not starbuck die if die he must in a woman s fainting fit up helm i say ye fools the jaw the jaw is this the end of all my bursting prayers all my life long fidelities oh ahab ahab lo thy work steady helmsman steady nay nay up helm again he turns to meet us oh his unappeasable browdrives on towards one whose duty tells him he cannot depart my god stand by me now stand not by me but stand under me whoever you are that willnow help stubb for stubb too sticks here i grin at thee thou grinning whale who ever helped stubb or kept stubb awake but stubb s own unwinking eye and now poor stubb goes to bed upona mattrass that is all too soft would it were stuffed with brushwood i grin at thee thou grinning whale look ye sun moon and stars i call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost for all that i would yet ring glasses with ye would ye but handthe cup oh oh oh oh thou grinning whale but there ll beplenty of gulping soon why fly ye not o ahab for me off shoesand jacket to it let stubb die in his drawers a most mouldyand over salted death though cherries cherries cherries oh flask for one red cherry ere we die cherries i only wish that we were where they grow oh stubb i hope my poor mother s drawn my part pay ere this if not few coppers will now come to her for the voyage is up from the ship s bows nearly all the seamen now hung inactive hammers bits of plank lances and harpoons mechanically retainedin their hands just as they had darted from their various employments all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale which from sideto side strangely vibrating his predestinating head sent a broadband of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed retribution swift vengeance eternal malice were in his whole aspect and spite of all that mortal man could do the solid white buttress of hisforehead smote the ship s starboard bow till men and timbers reeled some fell flat upon their faces like dislodged trucks the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their bull like necks through the breach they heard the waters pour as mountain torrentsdown a flume the ship the hearse the second hearse cried ahab from the boat its wood could only be american diving beneath the settling ship the whale ran quivering along its keel but turning under water swiftly shot to the surface again far offthe other bow but within a few yards of ahab s boat where for a time he lay quiescent i turn my body from the sun what ho tashtego let mehear thy hammer oh ye three unsurrendered spires of mine thou uncracked keel and only god bullied hull thou firm deck and haughty helm and pole pointed prow death glorious ship mustye then perish and without me am i cut off from the last fond prideof meanest shipwrecked captains

and the wood and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill the submergedsavage beneath in his death gasp kept his hammer frozen there and so the bird of heaven with archangelic shrieks and his
