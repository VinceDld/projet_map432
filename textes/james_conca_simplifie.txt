the golden bowl volume i henry james book first the prince part first i the prince had always liked his london when it had come to him he was one of the modern romans who find by the thames a more convincing image of the truth of the ancient state than any they have left by the tiber brought up on the legend of the city to which the world paid tribute he recognised in the present london much more than in contemporary rome the real dimensions of such a case if it was a question of an imperium he said to himself and if one wished as a roman to recover a little the sense of that the place to do so was on london bridge or even on a fine afternoon in may at hyde park corner it was not indeed to either of those places that these grounds of his predilection after all sufficiently vague had at the moment we are concerned with him guided his steps he had strayed simply enough into bond street where his imagination working at comparatively short range caused him now and then to stop before a window in which objects massive and lumpish in silver and gold in the forms to which precious stones contribute or in leather steel brass applied to a hundred uses and abuses were as tumbled together as if in the insolence of the empire they had been the loot of far off victories the young man s movements however betrayed no consistency of attention not even for that matter when one of his arrests had proceeded from possibilities in faces shaded as they passed him on the pavement by huge beribboned hats or more delicately tinted still under the tense silk of parasols held at perverse angles in waiting victorias and the prince s undirected thought was not a little symptomatic since though the turn of the season had come and the flush of the streets begun to fade the possibilities of faces on the august afternoon were still one of the notes of the scene he was too restless that was the fact for any concentration and the last idea that would just now have occurred to him in any connection was the idea of pursuit he had been pursuing for six months as never in his life before and what had actually unsteadied him as we join him was the sense of how he had been justified capture had crowned the pursuit or success as he would otherwise have put it had rewarded virtue whereby the consciousness of these things made him for the hour rather serious than gay a sobriety that might have consorted with failure sat in his handsome face constructively regular and grave yet at the same time oddly and as might be functionally almost radiant with its dark blue eyes its dark brown moustache and its expression no more sharply foreign to an english view than to have caused it sometimes to be observed of him with a shallow felicity that he looked like a refined irishman what had happened was that shortly before at three o clock his fate had practically been sealed and that even when one pretended to no quarrel with it the moment had something of the grimness of a crunched key in the strongest lock that could be made there was nothing to do as yet further but feel what one had done and our personage felt it while he aimlessly wandered it was already as if he were married so definitely had the solicitors at three o clock enabled the date to be fixed and by so few days was that date now distant he was to dine at half past eight o clock with the young lady on whose behalf and on whose father s the london lawyers had reached an inspired harmony with his own man of business poor calderoni fresh from rome and now apparently in the wondrous situation of being shown london before promptly leaving it again by mr verver himself mr verver whose easy way with his millions had taxed to such small purpose in the arrangements the principle of reciprocity the reciprocity with which the prince was during these minutes most struck was that of calderoni s bestowal of his company for a view of the lions if there was one thing in the world the young man at this juncture clearly intended it was to be much more decent as a son in law than lots of fellows he could think of had shown themselves in that character he thought of these fellows from whom he was so to differ in english he used mentally the english term to describe his difference for familiar with the tongue from his earliest years so that no note of strangeness remained with him either for lip or for ear he found it convenient in life for the greatest number of relations he found it convenient oddly even for his relation with himself though not unmindful that there might still as time went on be others including a more intimate degree of that one that would seek possibly with violence the larger or the finer issue which was it of the vernacular miss verver had told him he spoke english too well it was his only fault and he had not been able to speak worse even to oblige her when i speak worse you see i speak french he had said intimating thus that there were discriminations doubtless of the invidious kind for which that language was the most apt the girl had taken this she let him know as a reflection on her own french which she had always so dreamed of making good of making better to say nothing of his evident feeling that the idiom supposed a cleverness she was not a person to rise to the prince s answer to such remarks genial charming like every answer the parties to his new arrangement had yet had from him was that he was practising his american in order to converse properly on equal terms as it were with mr verver his prospective father in law had a command of it he said that put him at a disadvantage in any discussion besides which well besides which he had made to the girl the observation that positively of all his observations yet had most finely touched her you know i think he s a real galantuomo and no mistake there are plenty of sham ones about he seems to me simply the best man i ve ever seen in my life well my dear why shouldn t he be the girl had gaily inquired it was this precisely that had set the prince to think the things or many of them that had made mr verver what he was seemed practically to bring a charge of waste against the other things that with the other people known to the young man had failed of such a result why his form he had returned might have made one doubt father s form she hadn t seen it it strikes me he hasn t got any he hasn t got mine he hasn t even got yours thank you for even the girl had laughed at him oh yours my dear is tremendous but your father has his own i ve made that out so don t doubt it it s where it has brought him out that s the point it s his goodness that has brought him out our young woman had at this objected ah darling goodness i think never brought anyone out goodness when it s real precisely rather keeps people in he had been interested in his discrimination which amused him no it s his way it belongs to him but she had wondered still it s the american way that s all exactly it s all it s all i say it fits him so it must be good for something do you think it would be good for you maggie verver had smilingly asked to which his reply had been just of the happiest i don t feel my dear if you really want to know that anything much can now either hurt me or help me such as i am but you ll see for yourself say however i am a galantuomo which i devoutly hope i m like a chicken at best chopped up and smothered in sauce cooked down as a creme de volaille with half the parts left out your father s the natural fowl running about the bassecour his feathers movements his sounds those are the parts that with me are left out all as a matter of course since you can t eat a chicken alive the prince had not been annoyed at this but he had been positive well i m eating your father alive which is the only way to taste him i want to continue and as it s when he talks american that he is most alive so i must also cultivate it to get my pleasure he couldn t make one like him so much in any other language it mattered little that the girl had continued to demur it was the mere play of her joy i think he could make you like him in chinese it would be an unnecessary trouble what i mean is that he s a kind of result of his inevitable tone my liking is accordingly for the tone which has made him possible oh you ll hear enough of it she laughed before you ve done with us only this in truth had made him frown a little what do you mean please by my having done with you why found out about us all there is to find he had been able to take it indeed easily as a joke ah love i began with that i know enough i feel never to be surprised it s you yourselves meanwhile he continued who really know nothing there are two parts of me yes he had been moved to go on one is made up of the history the doings the marriages the crimes the follies the boundless betises of other people especially of their infamous waste of money that might have come to me those things are written literally in rows of volumes in libraries are as public as they re abominable everybody can get at them and you ve both of you wonderfully looked them in the face but there s another part very much smaller doubtless which such as it is represents my single self the unknown unimportant unimportant unimportant save to you personal quantity about this you ve found out nothing luckily my dear the girl had bravely said for what then would become please of the promised occupation of my future the young man remembered even now how extraordinarily clear he couldn t call it anything else she had looked in her prettiness as she had said it he also remembered what he had been moved to reply the happiest reigns we are taught you know are the reigns without any history oh i m not afraid of history she had been sure of that call it the bad part if you like yours certainly sticks out of you what was it else maggie verver had also said that made me originally think of you it wasn t as i should suppose you must have seen what you call your unknown quantity your particular self it was the generations behind you the follies and the crimes the plunder and the waste the wicked pope the monster most of all whom so many of the volumes in your family library are all about if i ve read but two or three yet i shall give myself up but the more as soon as i have time to the rest where therefore she had put it to him again without your archives annals infamies would you have been he recalled what to this he had gravely returned i might have been in a somewhat better pecuniary situation but his actual situation under the head in question positively so little mattered to them that having by that time lived deep into the sense of his advantage he had kept no impression of the girl s rejoinder it had but sweetened the waters in which he now floated tinted them as by the action of some essence poured from a gold topped phial for making one s bath aromatic no one before him never not even the infamous pope had so sat up to his neck in such a bath it showed for that matter how little one of his race could escape after all from history what was it but history and of their kind very much to have the assurance of the enjoyment of more money than the palace builder himself could have dreamed of this was the element that bore him up and into which maggie scattered on occasion her exquisite colouring drops they were of the colour of what on earth of what but the extraordinary american good faith they were of the colour of her innocence and yet at the same time of her imagination with which their relation his and these people s was all suffused what he had further said on the occasion of which we thus represent him as catching the echoes from his own thoughts while he loitered what he had further said came back to him for it had been the voice itself of his luck the soothing sound that was always with him you americans are almost incredibly romantic of course we are that s just what makes everything so nice for us everything he had wondered well everything that s nice at all the world the beautiful world or everything in it that is beautiful i mean we see so much he had looked at her a moment and he well knew how she had struck him in respect to the beautiful world as one of the beautiful the most beautiful things but what he had answered was you see too much that s what may sometimes make you difficulties when you don t at least he had amended with a further thought see too little but he had quite granted that he knew what she meant and his warning perhaps was needless he had seen the follies of the romantic disposition but there seemed somehow no follies in theirs nothing one was obliged to recognise but innocent pleasures pleasures without penalties their enjoyment was a tribute to others without being a loss to themselves only the funny thing he had respectfully submitted was that her father though older and wiser and a man into the bargain was as bad that is as good as herself oh he s better the girl had freely declared that is he s worse his relation to the things he cares for and i think it beautiful is absolutely romantic so is his whole life over here it s the most romantic thing i know you mean his idea for his native place yes the collection the museum with which he wishes to endow it and of which he thinks more as you know than of anything in the world it s the work of his life and the motive of everything he does the young man in his actual mood could have smiled again smiled delicately as he had then smiled at her has it been his motive in letting me have you yes my dear positively or in a manner she had said american city isn t by the way his native town for though he s not old it s a young thing compared with him a younger one he started there he has a feeling about it and the place has grown as he says like the programme of a charity performance you re at any rate a part of his collection she had explained one of the things that can only be got over here you re a rarity an object of beauty an object of price you re not perhaps absolutely unique but you re so curious and eminent that there are very few others like you you belong to a class about which everything is known you re what they call a morceau de musee i see i have the great sign of it he had risked that i cost a lot of money i haven t the least idea she had gravely answered what you cost and he had quite adored for the moment her way of saying it he had felt even for the moment vulgar but he had made the best of that wouldn t you find out if it were a question of parting with me my value would in that case be estimated she had looked at him with her charming eyes as if his value were well before her yes if you mean that i d pay rather than lose you and then there came again what this had made him say don t talk about me it s you who are not of this age you re a creature of a braver and finer one and the cinquecento at its most golden hour wouldn t have been ashamed of you it would of me and if i didn t know some of the pieces your father has acquired i should rather fear for american city the criticism of experts would it at all events be your idea he had then just ruefully asked to send me there for safety well we may have to come to it i ll go anywhere you want we must see first it will be only if we have to come to it there are things she had gone on that father puts away the bigger and more cumbrous of course which he stores has already stored in masses here and in paris in italy in spain in warehouses vaults banks safes wonderful secret places we ve been like a pair of pirates positively stage pirates the sort who wink at each other and say ha ha when they come to where their treasure is buried ours is buried pretty well everywhere except what we like to see what we travel with and have about us these the smaller pieces are the things we take out and arrange as we can to make the hotels we stay at and the houses we hire a little less ugly of course it s a danger and we have to keep watch but father loves a fine piece loves as he says the good of it and it s for the company of some of his things that he s willing to run his risks and we ve had extraordinary luck maggie had made that point we ve never lost anything yet and the finest objects are often the smallest values in lots of cases you must know have nothing to do with size but there s nothing however tiny she had wound up that we ve missed i like the class he had laughed for this in which you place me i shall be one of the little pieces that you unpack at the hotels or at the worst in the hired houses like this wonderful one and put out with the family photographs and the new magazines but it s something not to be so big that i have to be buried oh she had returned you shall not be buried my dear till you re dead unless indeed you call it burial to go to american city before i pronounce i should like to see my tomb so he had had after his fashion the last word in their interchange save for the result of an observation that had risen to his lips at the beginning which he had then checked and which now came back to him good bad or indifferent i hope there s one thing you believe about me he had sounded solemn even to himself but she had taken it gaily ah don t fix me down to one i believe things enough about you my dear to have a few left if most of them even go to smash i ve taken care of that i ve divided my faith into water tight compartments we must manage not to sink you do believe i m not a hypocrite you recognise that i don t lie or dissemble or deceive is that water tight the question to which he had given a certain intensity had made her he remembered stare an instant her colour rising as if it had sounded to her still stranger than he had intended he had perceived on the spot that any serious discussion of veracity of loyalty or rather of the want of them practically took her unprepared as if it were quite new to her he had noticed it before it was the english the american sign that duplicity like love had to be joked about it couldn t be gone into so the note of his inquiry was well to call it nothing else premature a mistake worth making however for the almost overdone drollery in which her answer instinctively sought refuge water tight the biggest compartment of all why it s the best cabin and the main deck and the engine room and the steward s pantry it s the ship itself it s the whole line it s the captain s table and all one s luggage one s reading for the trip she had images like that that were drawn from steamers and trains from a familiarity with lines a command of own cars from an experience of continents and seas that he was unable as yet to emulate from vast modern machineries and facilities whose acquaintance he had still to make but as to which it was part of the interest of his situation as it stood that he could quite without wincing feel his future likely to bristle with them it was in fact content as he was with his engagement and charming as he thought his affianced bride his view of that furniture that mainly constituted our young man s romance and to an extent that made of his inward state a contrast that he was intelligent enough to feel he was intelligent enough to feel quite humble to wish not to be in the least hard or voracious not to insist on his own side of the bargain to warn himself in short against arrogance and greed odd enough of a truth was his sense of this last danger which may illustrate moreover his general attitude toward dangers from within personally he considered he hadn t the vices in question and that was so much to the good his race on the other hand had had them handsomely enough and he was somehow full of his race its presence in him was like the consciousness of some inexpugnable scent in which his clothes his whole person his hands and the hair of his head might have been steeped as in some chemical bath the effect was nowhere in particular yet he constantly felt himself at the mercy of the cause he knew his antenatal history knew it in every detail and it was a thing to keep causes well before him what was his frank judgment of so much of its ugliness he asked himself but a part of the cultivation of humility what was this so important step he had just taken but the desire for some new history that should so far as possible contradict and even if need be flatly dishonour the old if what had come to him wouldn t do he must make something different he perfectly recognised always in his humility that the material for the making had to be mr verver s millions there was nothing else for him on earth to make it with he had tried before had had to look about and see the truth humble as he was at the same time he was not so humble as if he had known himself frivolous or stupid he had an idea which may amuse his historian that when you were stupid enough to be mistaken about such a matter you did know it therefore he wasn t mistaken his future might be might be scientific there was nothing in himself at all events to prevent it he was allying himself to science for it was science but the absence of prejudice backed by the presence of money his life would be full of machinery which was the antidote to superstition which was in its turn too much the consequence or at least the exhalation of archives he thought of these of his not being at all events futile and of his absolute acceptance of the developments of the coming age to redress the balance of his being so differently considered the moments when he most winced were those at which he found himself believing that really futility would have been forgiven him even with it in that absurd view he would have been good enough such was the laxity in the ververs of the romantic spirit they didn t indeed poor dears know what in that line the line of futility the real thing meant he did having seen it having tried it having taken its measure this was a memory in fact simply to screen out much as just in front of him while he walked the iron shutter of a shop closing early to the stale summer day rattled down at the turn of some crank there was machinery again just as the plate glass all about him was money was power the power of the rich peoples well he was of them now of the rich peoples he was on their side if it wasn t rather the pleasanter way of putting it that they were on his something of this sort was in any case the moral and the murmur of his walk it would have been ridiculous such a moral from such a source if it hadn t all somehow fitted to the gravity of the hour that gravity the oppression of which i began by recording another feature was the immediate nearness of the arrival of the contingent from home he was to meet them at charing cross on the morrow his younger brother who had married before him but whose wife of hebrew race with a portion that had gilded the pill was not in a condition to travel his sister and her husband the most anglicised of milanesi his maternal uncle the most shelved of diplomatists and his roman cousin don ottavio the most disponible of ex deputies and of relatives a scant handful of the consanguineous who in spite of maggie s plea for hymeneal reserve were to accompany him to the altar it was no great array yet it was apparently to be a more numerous muster than any possible to the bride herself having no wealth of kinship to choose from and making it up on the other hand by loose invitations he had been interested in the girl s attitude on the matter and had wholly deferred to it giving him as it did a glimpse distinctly pleasing of the kind of ruminations she would in general be governed by which were quite such as fell in with his own taste they hadn t natural relations she and her father she had explained so they wouldn t try to supply the place by artificial by make believe ones by any searching of highways and hedges oh yes they had acquaintances enough but a marriage was an intimate thing you asked acquaintances when you had your kith and kin you asked them over and above but you didn t ask them alone to cover your nudity and look like what they weren t she knew what she meant and what she liked and he was all ready to take from her finding a good omen in both of the facts he expected her desired her to have character his wife should have it and he wasn t afraid of her having much he had had in his earlier time to deal with plenty of people who had had it notably with the three four ecclesiastics his great uncle the cardinal above all who had taken a hand and played a part in his education the effect of all of which had never been to upset him he was thus fairly on the look out for the characteristic in this most intimate as she was to come of his associates he encouraged it when it appeared he felt therefore just at present as if his papers were in order as if his accounts so balanced as they had never done in his life before and he might close the portfolio with a snap it would open again doubtless of itself with the arrival of the romans it would even perhaps open with his dining to night in portland place where mr verver had pitched a tent suggesting that of alexander furnished with the spoils of darius but what meanwhile marked his crisis as i have said was his sense of the immediate two or three hours he paused on corners at crossings there kept rising for him in waves that consciousness sharp as to its source while vague as to its end which i began by speaking of the consciousness of an appeal to do something or other before it was too late for himself by any friend to whom he might have mentioned it the appeal could have been turned to frank derision for what for whom indeed but himself and the high advantages attached was he about to marry an extraordinarily charming girl whose prospects of the solid sort were as guaranteed as her amiability he wasn t to do it assuredly all for her the prince as happened however was so free to feel and yet not to formulate that there rose before him after a little definitely the image of a friend whom he had often found ironic he withheld the tribute of attention from passing faces only to let his impulse accumulate youth and beauty made him scarcely turn but the image of mrs assingham made him presently stop a hansom her youth her beauty were things more or less of the past but to find her at home as he possibly might would be doing what he still had time for would put something of a reason into his restlessness and thereby probably soothe it to recognise the propriety of this particular pilgrimage she lived far enough off in long cadogan place was already in fact to work it off a little a perception of the propriety of formally thanking her and of timing the act just as he happened to be doing this he made out as he went was obviously all that had been the matter with him it was true that he had mistaken the mood of the moment misread it rather superficially as an impulse to look the other way the other way from where his pledges had accumulated mrs assingham precisely represented embodied his pledges was in her pleasant person the force that had set them successively in motion she had made his marriage quite as truly as his papal ancestor had made his family though he could scarce see what she had made it for unless because she too was perversely romantic he had neither bribed nor persuaded her had given her nothing scarce even till now articulate thanks so that her profit to think of it vulgarly must have all had to come from the ververs yet he was far he could still remind himself from supposing that she had been grossly remunerated he was wholly sure she hadn t for if there were people who took presents and people who didn t she would be quite on the right side and of the proud class only then on the other hand her disinterestedness was rather awful it implied that is such abysses of confidence she was admirably attached to maggie whose possession of such a friend might moreover quite rank as one of her assets but the great proof of her affection had been in bringing them with her design together meeting him during a winter in rome meeting him afterwards in paris and liking him as she had in time frankly let him know from the first she had marked him for her young friend s own and had then unmistakably presented him in a light but the interest in maggie that was the point would have achieved but little without her interest in him on what did that sentiment unsolicited and unrecompensed rest what good again for it was much like his question about mr verver should he ever have done her the prince s notion of a recompense to women similar in this to his notion of an appeal was more or less to make love to them now he hadn t as he believed made love the least little bit to mrs assingham nor did he think she had for a moment supposed it he liked in these days to mark them off the women to whom he hadn t made love it represented and that was what pleased him in it a different stage of existence from the time at which he liked to mark off the women to whom he had neither with all this had mrs assingham herself been either aggressive or resentful on what occasion ever had she appeared to find him wanting these things the motives of such people were obscure a little alarmingly so they contributed to that element of the impenetrable which alone slightly qualified his sense of his good fortune he remembered to have read as a boy a wonderful tale by allan poe his prospective wife s countryman which was a thing to show by the way what imagination americans could have the story of the shipwrecked gordon pym who drifting in a small boat further toward the north pole or was it the south than anyone had ever done found at a given moment before him a thickness of white air that was like a dazzling curtain of light concealing as darkness conceals yet of the colour of milk or of snow there were moments when he felt his own boat move upon some such mystery the state of mind of his new friends including mrs assingham herself had resemblances to a great white curtain he had never known curtains but as purple even to blackness but as producing where they hung a darkness intended and ominous when they were so disposed as to shelter surprises the surprises were apt to be shocks shocks however from these quite different depths were not what he saw reason to apprehend what he rather seemed to himself not yet to have measured was something that seeking a name for it he would have called the quantity of confidence reposed in him he had stood still at many a moment of the previous month with the thought freshly determined or renewed of the general expectation to define it roughly of which he was the subject what was singular was that it seemed not so much an expectation of anything in particular as a large bland blank assumption of merits almost beyond notation of essential quality and value it was as if he had been some old embossed coin of a purity of gold no longer used stamped with glorious arms mediaeval wonderful of which the worth in mere modern change sovereigns and half crowns would be great enough but as to which since there were finer ways of using it such taking to pieces was superfluous that was the image for the security in which it was open to him to rest he was to constitute a possession yet was to escape being reduced to his component parts what would this mean but that practically he was never to be tried or tested what would it mean but that if they didn t change him they really wouldn t know he wouldn t know himself how many pounds shillings and pence he had to give these at any rate for the present were unanswerable questions all that was before him was that he was invested with attributes he was taken seriously lost there in the white mist was the seriousness in them that made them so take him it was even in mrs assingham in spite of her having as she had frequently shown a more mocking spirit all he could say as yet was that he had done nothing so far as to break any charm what should he do if he were to ask her frankly this afternoon what was morally speaking behind their veil it would come to asking what they expected him to do she would answer him probably oh you know it s what we expect you to be on which he would have no resource but to deny his knowledge would that break the spell his saying he had no idea what idea in fact could he have he also took himself seriously made a point of it but it wasn t simply a question of fancy and pretension his own estimate he saw ways at one time and another of dealing with but theirs sooner or later say what they might would put him to the practical proof as the practical proof accordingly would naturally be proportionate to the cluster of his attributes one arrived at a scale that he was not honestly the man to calculate who but a billionaire could say what was fair exchange for a billion that measure was the shrouded object but he felt really as his cab stopped in cadogan place a little nearer the shroud he promised himself virtually to give the latter a twitch ii they re not good days you know he had said to fanny assingham after declaring himself grateful for finding her and then with his cup of tea putting her in possession of the latest news the documents signed an hour ago de part et d autre and the telegram from his backers who had reached paris the morning before and who pausing there a little poor dears seemed to think the whole thing a tremendous lark we re very simple folk mere country cousins compared with you he had also observed and paris for my sister and her husband is the end of the world london therefore will be more or less another planet it has always been as with so many of us quite their mecca but this is their first real caravan they ve mainly known old england as a shop for articles in india rubber and leather in which they ve dressed themselves as much as possible which all means however that you ll see them all of them wreathed in smiles we must be very easy with them maggie s too wonderful her preparations are on a scale she insists on taking in the sposi and my uncle the others will come to me i ve been engaging their rooms at the hotel and with all those solemn signatures of an hour ago that brings the case home to me do you mean you re afraid his hostess had amusedly asked terribly afraid i ve now but to wait to see the monster come they re not good days they re neither one thing nor the other i ve really got nothing yet i ve everything to lose one doesn t know what still may happen the way she laughed at him was for an instant almost irritating it came out for his fancy from behind the white curtain it was a sign that is of her deep serenity which worried instead of soothing him and to be soothed after all to be tided over in his mystic impatience to be told what he could understand and believe that was what he had come for marriage then said mrs assingham is what you call the monster i admit it s a fearful thing at the best but for heaven s sake if that s what you re thinking of don t run away from it ah to run away from it would be to run away from you the prince replied and i ve already told you often enough how i depend on you to see me through he so liked the way she took this from the corner of her sofa that he gave his sincerity for it was sincerity fuller expression i m starting on the great voyage across the unknown sea my ship s all rigged and appointed the cargo s stowed away and the company complete but what seems the matter with me is that i can t sail alone my ship must be one of a pair must have in the waste of waters a what do you call it a consort i don t ask you to stay on board with me but i must keep your sail in sight for orientation i don t in the least myself know i assure you the points of the compass but with a lead i can perfectly follow you must be my lead how can you be sure she asked where i should take you why from your having brought me safely thus far i should never have got here without you you ve provided the ship itself and if you ve not quite seen me aboard you ve attended me ever so kindly to the dock your own vessel is all conveniently in the next berth and you can t desert me now she showed him again her amusement which struck him even as excessive as if to his surprise he made her also a little nervous she treated him in fine as if he were not uttering truths but making pretty figures for her diversion my vessel dear prince she smiled what vessel in the world have i this little house is all our ship bob s and mine and thankful we are now to have it we ve wandered far living as you may say from hand to mouth without rest for the soles of our feet but the time has come for us at last to draw in he made at this the young man an indignant protest you talk about rest it s too selfish when you re just launching me on adventures she shook her head with her kind lucidity not adventures heaven forbid you ve had yours as i ve had mine and my idea has been all along that we should neither of us begin again my own last precisely has been doing for you all you so prettily mention but it consists simply in having conducted you to rest you talk about ships but they re not the comparison your tossings are over you re practically in port the port she concluded of the golden isles he looked about to put himself more in relation with the place then after an hesitation seemed to speak certain words instead of certain others oh i know where i am i do decline to be left but what i came for of course was to thank you if to day has seemed for the first time the end of preliminaries i feel how little there would have been any at all without you the first were wholly yours well said mrs assingham they were remarkably easy i ve seen them i ve had them she smiled more difficult everything you must feel went of itself so you must feel everything still goes the prince quickly agreed oh beautifully but you had the conception ah prince so had you he looked at her harder a moment you had it first you had it most she returned his look as if it had made her wonder i liked it if that s what you mean but you liked it surely yourself i protest that i had easy work with you i had only at last when i thought it was time to speak for you all that is quite true but you re leaving me all the same you re leaving me you re washing your hands of me he went on however that won t be easy i won t be left and he had turned his eyes about again taking in the pretty room that she had just described as her final refuge the place of peace for a world worn couple to which she had lately retired with bob i shall keep this spot in sight say what you will i shall need you i m not you know he declared going to give you up for anybody if you re afraid which of course you re not are you trying to make me the same she asked after a moment he waited a minute too then answered her with a question you say you liked it your undertaking to make my engagement possible it remains beautiful for me that you did it s charming and unforgettable but still more it s mysterious and wonderful why you dear delightful woman did you like it i scarce know what to make she said of such an inquiry if you haven t by this time found out yourself what meaning can anything i say have for you don t you really after all feel she added while nothing came from him aren t you conscious every minute of the perfection of the creature of whom i ve put you into possession every minute gratefully conscious but that s exactly the ground of my question it wasn t only a matter of your handing me over it was a matter of your handing her it was a matter of her fate still more than of mine you thought all the good of her that one woman can think of another and yet by your account you enjoyed assisting at her risk she had kept her eyes on him while he spoke and this was what visibly determined a repetition for her are you trying to frighten me ah that s a foolish view i should be too vulgar you apparently can t understand either my good faith or my humility i m awfully humble the young man insisted that s the way i ve been feeling to day with everything so finished and ready and you won t take me for serious she continued to face him as if he really troubled her a little oh you deep old italians there you are he returned it s what i wanted you to come to that s the responsible note yes she went on if you re humble you must be dangerous she had a pause while he only smiled then she said i don t in the least want to lose sight of you but even if i did i shouldn t think it right thank you for that it s what i needed of you i m sure after all that the more you re with me the more i shall understand it s the only thing in the world i want i m excellent i really think all round except that i m stupid i can do pretty well anything i see but i ve got to see it first and he pursued his demonstration i don t in the least mind its having to be shown me in fact i like that better therefore it is that i want that i shall always want your eyes through them i wish to look even at any risk of their showing me what i mayn t like for then he wound up i shall know and of that i shall never be afraid she might quite have been waiting to see what he would come to but she spoke with a certain impatience what on earth are you talking about but he could perfectly say of my real honest fear of being off some day of being wrong without knowing it that s what i shall always trust you for to tell me when i am no with you people it s a sense we haven t got it not as you have therefore but he had said enough ecco he simply smiled it was not to be concealed that he worked upon her but of course she had always liked him i should be interested she presently remarked to see some sense you don t possess well he produced one on the spot the moral dear mrs assingham i mean always as you others consider it i ve of course something that in our poor dear backward old rome sufficiently passes for it but it s no more like yours than the tortuous stone staircase half ruined into the bargain in some castle of our quattrocento is like the lightning elevator in one of mr verver s fifteen storey buildings your moral sense works by steam it sends you up like a rocket ours is slow and steep and unlighted with so many of the steps missing that well that it s as short in almost any case to turn round and come down again trusting mrs assingham smiled to get up some other way yes or not to have to get up at all however he added i told you that at the beginning machiavelli she simply exclaimed you do me too much honour i wish indeed i had his genius however if you really believe i have his perversity you wouldn t say it but it s all right he gaily enough concluded i shall always have you to come to on this for a little they sat face to face after which without comment she asked him if he would have more tea all she would give him he promptly signified and he developed making her laugh his idea that the tea of the english race was somehow their morality made with boiling water in a little pot so that the more of it one drank the more moral one would become his drollery served as a transition and she put to him several questions about his sister and the others questions as to what bob in particular colonel assingham her husband could do for the arriving gentlemen whom by the prince s leave he would immediately go to see he was funny while they talked about his own people too whom he described with anecdotes of their habits imitations of their manners and prophecies of their conduct as more rococo than anything cadogan place would ever have known this mrs assingham professed was exactly what would endear them to her and that in turn drew from her visitor a fresh declaration of all the comfort of his being able so to depend on her he had been with her at this point some twenty minutes but he had paid her much longer visits and he stayed now as if to make his attitude prove his appreciation he stayed moreover that was really the sign of the hour in spite of the nervous unrest that had brought him and that had in truth much rather fed on the scepticism by which she had apparently meant to soothe it she had not soothed him and there arrived remarkably a moment when the cause of her failure gleamed out he had not frightened her as she called it he felt that yet she was herself not at ease she had been nervous though trying to disguise it the sight of him following on the announcement of his name had shown her as disconcerted this conviction for the young man deepened and sharpened yet with the effect too of making him glad in spite of it it was as if in calling he had done even better than he intended for it was somehow important that was what it was that there should be at this hour something the matter with mrs assingham with whom in all their acquaintance so considerable now there had never been the least little thing the matter to wait thus and watch for it was to know of a truth that there was something the matter with him since strangely with so little to go upon his heart had positively begun to beat to the tune of suspense it fairly befell at last for a climax that they almost ceased to pretend to pretend that is to cheat each other with forms the unspoken had come up and there was a crisis neither could have said how long it lasted during which they were reduced for all interchange to looking at each other on quite an inordinate scale they might at this moment in their positively portentous stillness have been keeping it up for a wager sitting for their photograph or even enacting a tableau vivant the spectator of whom they would thus well have been worthy might have read meanings of his own into the intensity of their communion or indeed even without meanings have found his account aesthetically in some gratified play of our modern sense of type so scantly to be distinguished from our modern sense of beauty type was there at the worst in mrs assingham s dark neat head on which the crisp black hair made waves so fine and so numerous that she looked even more in the fashion of the hour than she desired full of discriminations against the obvious she had yet to accept a flagrant appearance and to make the best of misleading signs her richness of hue her generous nose her eyebrows marked like those of an actress these things with an added amplitude of person on which middle age had set its seal seemed to present her insistently as a daughter of the south or still more of the east a creature formed by hammocks and divans fed upon sherbets and waited upon by slaves she looked as if her most active effort might be to take up as she lay back her mandolin or to share a sugared fruit with a pet gazelle she was in fact however neither a pampered jewess nor a lazy creole new york had been recordedly her birthplace and europe punctually her discipline she wore yellow and purple because she thought it better as she said while one was about it to look like the queen of sheba than like a revendeuse she put pearls in her hair and crimson and gold in her tea gown for the same reason it was her theory that nature itself had overdressed her and that her only course was to drown as it was hopeless to try to chasten the overdressing so she was covered and surrounded with things which were frankly toys and shams a part of the amusement with which she rejoiced to supply her friends these friends were in the game that of playing with the disparity between her aspect and her character her character was attested by the second movement of her face which convinced the beholder that her vision of the humours of the world was not supine not passive she enjoyed she needed the warm air of friendship but the eyes of the american city looked out somehow for the opportunity of it from under the lids of jerusalem with her false indolence in short her false leisure her false pearls and palms and courts and fountains she was a person for whom life was multitudinous detail detail that left her as it at any moment found her unappalled and unwearied sophisticated as i may appear it was her frequent phrase she had found sympathy her best resource it gave her plenty to do it made her as she also said sit up she had in her life two great holes to fill and she described herself as dropping social scraps into them as she had known old ladies in her early american time drop morsels of silk into the baskets in which they collected the material for some eventual patchwork quilt one of these gaps in mrs assingham s completeness was her want of children the other was her want of wealth it was wonderful how little either in the fulness of time came to show sympathy and curiosity could render their objects practically filial just as an english husband who in his military years had run everything in his regiment could make economy blossom like the rose colonel bob had a few years after his marriage left the army which had clearly by that time done its laudable all for the enrichment of his personal experience and he could thus give his whole time to the gardening in question there reigned among the younger friends of this couple a legend almost too venerable for historical criticism that the marriage itself the happiest of its class dated from the far twilight of the age a primitive period when such things such things as american girls accepted as good enough had not begun to be so that the pleasant pair had been as to the risk taken on either side bold and original honourably marked for the evening of life as discoverers of a kind of hymeneal northwest passage mrs assingham knew better knew there had been no historic hour from that of pocahontas down when some young englishman hadn t precipitately believed and some american girl hadn t with a few more gradations availed herself to the full of her incapacity to doubt but she accepted resignedly the laurel of the founder since she was in fact pretty well the doyenne above ground of her transplanted tribe and since above all she had invented combinations though she had not invented bob s own it was he who had done that absolutely puzzled it out by himself from his first odd glimmer resting upon it moreover through the years to come as proof enough in him by itself of the higher cleverness if she kept her own cleverness up it was largely that he should have full credit there were moments in truth when she privately felt how little striking out as he had done he could have afforded that she should show the common limits but mrs assingham s cleverness was in truth tested when her present visitor at last said to her i don t think you know that you re treating me quite right you ve something on your mind that you don t tell me it was positive too that her smile in reply was a trifle dim am i obliged to tell you everything i have on my mind it isn t a question of everything but it s a question of anything that may particularly concern me then you shouldn t keep it back you know with what care i desire to proceed taking everything into account and making no mistake that may possibly injure her mrs assingham at this had after an instant an odd interrogation her her and him both our friends either maggie or her father i have something on my mind mrs assingham presently returned something has happened for which i hadn t been prepared but it isn t anything that properly concerns you the prince with immediate gaiety threw back his head what do you mean by properly i somehow see volumes in it it s the way people put a thing when they put it well wrong i put things right what is it that has happened for me his hostess the next moment had drawn spirit from his tone oh i shall be delighted if you ll take your share of it charlotte stant is in london she has just been here miss stant oh really the prince expressed clear surprise a transparency through which his eyes met his friend s with a certain hardness of concussion she has arrived from america he then quickly asked she appears to have arrived this noon coming up from southampton at an hotel she dropped upon me after luncheon and was here for more than an hour the young man heard with interest though not with an interest too great for his gaiety you think then i ve a share in it what is my share why any you like the one you seemed just now eager to take it was you yourself who insisted he looked at her on this with conscious inconsistency and she could now see that he had changed colour but he was always easy i didn t know then what the matter was you didn t think it could be so bad do you call it very bad the young man asked only she smiled because that s the way it seems to affect you he hesitated still with the trace of his quickened colour still looking at her still adjusting his manner but you allowed you were upset to the extent yes of not having in the least looked for her any more said mrs assingham than i judge maggie to have done the prince thought then as if glad to be able to say something very natural and true no quite right maggie hasn t looked for her but i m sure he added she ll be delighted to see her that certainly and his hostess spoke with a different shade of gravity she ll be quite overjoyed the prince went on has miss stant now gone to her she has gone back to her hotel to bring her things here i can t have her said mrs assingham alone at an hotel no i see if she s here at all she must stay with me he quite took it in so she s coming now i expect her at any moment if you wait you ll see her oh he promptly declared charming but this word came out as if a little in sudden substitution for some other it sounded accidental whereas he wished to be firm that accordingly was what he next showed himself if it wasn t for what s going on these next days maggie would certainly want to have her in fact he lucidly continued isn t what s happening just a reason to make her want to mrs assingham for answer only looked at him and this the next instant had apparently had more effect than if she had spoken for he asked a question that seemed incongruous what has she come for it made his companion laugh why for just what you say for your marriage mine he wondered maggie s it s the same thing it s for your great event and then said mrs assingham she s so lonely has she given you that as a reason i scarcely remember she gave me so many she abounds poor dear in reasons but there s one that whatever she does i always remember for myself and which is that he looked as if he ought to guess but couldn t why the fact that she has no home absolutely none whatever she s extraordinarily alone again he took it in and also has no great means very small ones which is not however with the expense of railways and hotels a reason for her running to and fro on the contrary but she doesn t like her country hers my dear man it s little enough hers the attribution for the moment amused his hostess she has rebounded now but she has had little enough else to do with it oh i say hers the prince pleasantly explained very much as at this time of day i might say mine i quite feel i assure you as if the great place already more or less belonged to me that s your good fortune and your point of view you own or you soon practically will own so much of it charlotte owns almost nothing in the world she tells me but two colossal trunks only one of which i have given her leave to introduce into this house she ll depreciate to you mrs assingham added your property he thought of these things he thought of every thing but he had always his resource at hand of turning all to the easy has she come with designs upon me and then in a moment as if even this were almost too grave he sounded the note that had least to do with himself est elle toujours aussi belle that was the furthest point somehow to which charlotte stant could be relegated mrs assingham treated it freely just the same the person in the world to my sense whose looks are most subject to appreciation it s all in the way she affects you one admires her if one doesn t happen not to so as well one criticises her ah that s not fair said the prince to criticise her then there you are you re answered i m answered he took it humorously as his lesson sank his previous self consciousness with excellent effect in grateful docility i only meant that there are perhaps better things to be done with miss stant than to criticise her when once you begin that with anyone he was vague and kind i quite agree that it s better to keep out of it as long as one can but when one must do it yes he asked as she paused then know what you mean i see perhaps he smiled i don t know what i mean well it s what just now in all ways you particularly should know mrs assingham however made no more of this having before anything else apparently a scruple about the tone she had just used i quite understand of course that given her great friendship with maggie she should have wanted to be present she has acted impulsively but she has acted generously she has acted beautifully said the prince i say generously because i mean she hasn t in any way counted the cost she ll have it to count in a manner now his hostess continued but that doesn t matter he could see how little you ll look after her i ll look after her so it s all right it s all right said mrs assingham then why are you troubled it pulled her up but only for a minute i m not any more than you the prince s dark blue eyes were of the finest and on occasion precisely resembled nothing so much as the high windows of a roman palace of an historic front by one of the great old designers thrown open on a feast day to the golden air his look itself at such times suggested an image that of some very noble personage who expected acclaimed by the crowd in the street and with old precious stuffs falling over the sill for his support had gaily and gallantly come to show himself always moreover less in his own interest than in that of spectators and subjects whose need to admire even to gape was periodically to be considered the young man s expression became after this fashion something vivid and concrete a beautiful personal presence that of a prince in very truth a ruler warrior patron lighting up brave architecture and diffusing the sense of a function it had been happily said of his face that the figure thus appearing in the great frame was the ghost of some proudest ancestor whoever the ancestor now at all events the prince was for mrs assingham s benefit in view of the people he seemed leaning on crimson damask to take in the bright day he looked younger than his years he was beautiful innocent vague oh well i m not he rang out clear i should like to see you sir she said for you wouldn t have a shadow of excuse he showed how he agreed that he would have been at a loss for one and the fact of their serenity was thus made as important as if some danger of its opposite had directly menaced them the only thing was that if the evidence of their cheer was so established mrs assingham had a little to explain her original manner and she came to this before they dropped the question my first impulse is always to behave about everything as if i feared complications but i don t fear them i really like them they re quite my element he deferred for her to this account of herself but still he said if we re not in the presence of a complication she hesitated a handsome clever odd girl staying with one is always a complication the young man weighed it almost as if the question were new to him and will she stay very long his friend gave a laugh how in the world can i know i ve scarcely asked her ah yes you can t but something in the tone of it amused her afresh do you think you could i he wondered do you think you could get it out of her for me the probable length of her stay he rose bravely enough to the occasion and the challenge i daresay if you were to give me the chance here it is then for you she answered for she had heard within the minute the stop of a cab at her door she s back iii it had been said as a joke but as after this they awaited their friend in silence the effect of the silence was to turn the time to gravity a gravity not dissipated even when the prince next spoke he had been thinking the case over and making up his mind a handsome clever odd girl staying with one was a complication mrs assingham so far was right but there were the facts the good relations from schooldays of the two young women and the clear confidence with which one of them had arrived she can come you know at any time to us mrs assingham took it up with an irony beyond laughter you d like her for your honeymoon oh no you must keep her for that but why not after she had looked at him a minute then at the sound of a voice in the corridor they had got up why not you re splendid charlotte stant the next minute was with them ushered in as she had alighted from her cab and prepared for not finding mrs assingham alone this would have been to be noticed by the butler s answer on the stairs to a question put to him she could have looked at her hostess with such straightness and brightness only from knowing that the prince was also there the discrimination of but a moment yet which let him take her in still better than if she had instantly faced him he availed himself of the chance thus given him for he was conscious of all these things what he accordingly saw for some seconds with intensity was a tall strong charming girl who wore for him at first exactly the look of her adventurous situation a suggestion in all her person in motion and gesture in free vivid yet altogether happy indications of dress from the becoming compactness of her hat to the shade of tan in her shoes of winds and waves and custom houses of far countries and long journeys the knowledge of how and where and the habit founded on experience of not being afraid he was aware at the same time that of this combination the strongminded note was not as might have been apprehended the basis he was now sufficiently familiar with english speaking types he had sounded attentively enough such possibilities for a quick vision of differences he had besides his own view of this young lady s strength of mind it was great he had ground to believe but it would never interfere with the play of her extremely personal her always amusing taste this last was the thing in her for she threw it out positively on the spot like a light that she might have reappeared during these moments just to cool his worried eyes with he saw her in her light that immediate exclusive address to their friend was like a lamp she was holding aloft for his benefit and for his pleasure it showed him everything above all her presence in the world so closely so irretrievably contemporaneous with his own a sharp sharp fact sharper during these instants than any other at all even than that of his marriage but accompanied in a subordinate and controlled way with those others facial physiognomic that mrs assingham had been speaking of as subject to appreciation so they were these others as he met them again and that was the connection they instantly established with him if they had to be interpreted this made at least for intimacy there was but one way certainly for him to interpret them in the sense of the already known making use then of clumsy terms of excess the face was too narrow and too long the eyes not large and the mouth on the other hand by no means small with substance in its lips and a slight the very slightest tendency to protrusion in the solid teeth otherwise indeed well arrayed and flashingly white but it was strangely as a cluster of possessions of his own that these things in charlotte stant now affected him items in a full list items recognised each of them as if for the long interval they had been stored wrapped up numbered put away in a cabinet while she faced mrs assingham the door of the cabinet had opened of itself he took the relics out one by one and it was more and more each instant as if she were giving him time he saw again that her thick hair was vulgarly speaking brown but that there was a shade of tawny autumn leaf in it for appreciation a colour indescribable and of which he had known no other case something that gave her at moments the sylvan head of a huntress he saw the sleeves of her jacket drawn to her wrists but he again made out the free arms within them to be of the completely rounded the polished slimness that florentine sculptors in the great time had loved and of which the apparent firmness is expressed in their old silver and old bronze he knew her narrow hands he knew her long fingers and the shape and colour of her finger nails he knew her special beauty of movement and line when she turned her back and the perfect working of all her main attachments that of some wonderful finished instrument something intently made for exhibition for a prize he knew above all the extraordinary fineness of her flexible waist the stem of an expanded flower which gave her a likeness also to some long loose silk purse well filled with gold pieces but having been passed empty through a finger ring that held it together it was as if before she turned to him he had weighed the whole thing in his open palm and even heard a little the chink of the metal when she did turn to him it was to recognise with her eyes what he might have been doing she made no circumstance of thus coming upon him save so far as the intelligence in her face could at any moment make a circumstance of almost anything if when she moved off she looked like a huntress she looked when she came nearer like his notion perhaps not wholly correct of a muse but what she said was simply you see you re not rid of me how is dear maggie it was to come soon enough by the quite unforced operation of chance the young man s opportunity to ask her the question suggested by mrs assingham shortly before her entrance the license had he chosen to embrace it was within a few minutes all there the license given him literally to inquire of this young lady how long she was likely to be with them for a matter of the mere domestic order had quickly determined on mrs assingham s part a withdrawal of a few moments which had the effect of leaving her visitors free mrs betterman s there she had said to charlotte in allusion to some member of the household who was to have received her and seen her belongings settled to which charlotte had replied that she had encountered only the butler who had been quite charming she had deprecated any action taken on behalf of her effects but her hostess rebounding from accumulated cushions evidently saw more in mrs betterman s non appearance than could meet the casual eye what she saw in short demanded her intervention in spite of an earnest let me go from the girl and a prolonged smiling wail over the trouble she was giving the prince was quite aware at this moment that departure for himself was indicated the question of miss stant s installation didn t demand his presence it was a case for one to go away if one hadn t a reason for staying he had a reason however of that he was equally aware and he had not for a good while done anything more conscious and intentional than not quickly to take leave his visible insistence for it came to that even demanded of him a certain disagreeable effort the sort of effort he had mostly associated with acting for an idea his idea was there his idea was to find out something something he wanted much to know and to find it out not tomorrow not at some future time not in short with waiting and wondering but if possible before quitting the place this particular curiosity moreover confounded itself a little with the occasion offered him to satisfy mrs assingham s own he wouldn t have admitted that he was staying to ask a rude question there was distinctly nothing rude in his having his reasons it would be rude for that matter to turn one s back without a word or two on an old friend well as it came to pass he got the word or two for mrs assingham s preoccupation was practically simplifying the little crisis was of shorter duration than our account of it duration naturally would have forced him to take up his hat he was somehow glad on finding himself alone with charlotte that he had not been guilty of that inconsequence not to be flurried was the kind of consistency he wanted just as consistency was the kind of dignity and why couldn t he have dignity when he had so much of the good conscience as it were on which such advantages rested he had done nothing he oughtn t he had in fact done nothing at all once more as a man conscious of having known many women he could assist as he would have called it at the recurrent the predestined phenomenon the thing always as certain as sunrise or the coming round of saints days the doing by the woman of the thing that gave her away she did it ever inevitably infallibly she couldn t possibly not do it it was her nature it was her life and the man could always expect it without lifting a finger this was his the man s any man s position and strength that he had necessarily the advantage that he only had to wait with a decent patience to be placed in spite of himself it might really be said in the right just so the punctuality of performance on the part of the other creature was her weakness and her deep misfortune not less no doubt than her beauty it produced for the man that extraordinary mixture of pity and profit in which his relation with her when he was not a mere brute mainly consisted and gave him in fact his most pertinent ground of being always nice to her nice about her nice for her she always dressed her act up of course she muffled and disguised and arranged it showing in fact in these dissimulations a cleverness equal to but one thing in the world equal to her abjection she would let it be known for anything for everything but the truth of which it was made that was what precisely charlotte stant would be doing now that was the present motive and support to a certainty of each of her looks and motions she was the twentieth woman she was possessed by her doom but her doom was also to arrange appearances and what now concerned him was to learn how she proposed he would help her would arrange with her to any point in reason the only thing was to know what appearance could best be produced and best be preserved produced and preserved on her part of course since on his own there had been luckily no folly to cover up nothing but a perfect accord between conduct and obligation they stood there together at all events when the door had closed behind their friend with a conscious strained smile and very much as if each waited for the other to strike the note or give the pitch the young man held himself in his silent suspense only not more afraid because he felt her own fear she was afraid of herself however whereas to his gain of lucidity he was afraid only of her would she throw herself into his arms or would she be otherwise wonderful she would see what he would do so their queer minute without words told him and she would act accordingly but what could he do but just let her see that he would make anything everything for her as honourably easy as possible even if she should throw herself into his arms he would make that easy easy that is to overlook to ignore not to remember and not by the same token either to regret this was not what in fact happened though it was also not at a single touch but by the finest gradations that his tension subsided it s too delightful to be back she said at last and it was all she definitely gave him being moreover nothing but what anyone else might have said yet with two or three other things that on his response followed it it quite pointed the path while the tone of it and her whole attitude were as far removed as need have been from the truth of her situation the abjection that was present to him as of the essence quite failed to peep out and he soon enough saw that if she was arranging she could be trusted to arrange good it was all he asked and all the more that he could admire and like her for it the particular appearance she would as they said go in for was that of having no account whatever to give him it would be in fact that of having none to give anybody of reasons or of motives of comings or of goings she was a charming young woman who had met him before but she was also a charming young woman with a life of her own she would take it high up up up ever so high well then he would do the same no height would be too great for them not even the dizziest conceivable to a young person so subtle the dizziest seemed indeed attained when after another moment she came as near as she was to come to an apology for her abruptness i ve been thinking of maggie and at last i yearned for her i wanted to see her happy and it doesn t strike me i find you too shy to tell me i shall of course she s happy thank god only it s almost terrible you know the happiness of young good generous creatures it rather frightens one but the blessed virgin and all the saints said the prince have her in their keeping certainly they have she s the dearest of the dear but i needn t tell you the girl added ah he returned with gravity i feel that i ve still much to learn about her to which he subjoined she ll rejoice awfully in your being with us oh you don t need me charlotte smiled it s her hour it s a great hour one has seen often enough with girls what it is but that she said is exactly why why i ve wanted i mean not to miss it he bent on her a kind comprehending face you mustn t miss anything he had got it the pitch and he could keep it now for all he had needed was to have it given him the pitch was the happiness of his wife that was to be the sight of that happiness as a joy for an old friend it was yes magnificent and not the less so for its coming to him suddenly as sincere as nobly exalted something in charlotte s eyes seemed to tell him this seemed to plead with him in advance as to what he was to find in it he was eager and he tried to show her that too to find what she liked mindful as he easily could be of what the friendship had been for maggie it had been armed with the wings of young imagination young generosity it had been he believed always counting out her intense devotion to her father the liveliest emotion she had known before the dawn of the sentiment inspired by himself she had not to his knowledge invited the object of it to their wedding had not thought of proposing to her for a matter of a couple of hours an arduous and expensive journey but she had kept her connected and informed from week to week in spite of preparations and absorptions oh i ve been writing to charlotte i wish you knew her better he could still hear from recent weeks this record of the fact just as he could still be conscious not otherwise than queerly of the gratuitous element in maggie s wish which he had failed as yet to indicate to her older and perhaps more intelligent at any rate why shouldn t charlotte respond and be quite free to respond to such fidelities with something more than mere formal good manners the relations of women with each other were of the strangest it was true and he probably wouldn t have trusted here a young person of his own race he was proceeding throughout on the ground of the immense difference difficult indeed as it might have been to disembroil in this young person her race quality nothing in her definitely placed her she was a rare a special product her singleness her solitude her want of means that is her want of ramifications and other advantages contributed to enrich her somehow with an odd precious neutrality to constitute for her so detached yet so aware a sort of small social capital it was the only one she had it was the only one a lonely gregarious girl could have since few surely had in anything like the same degree arrived at it and since this one indeed had compassed it but through the play of some gift of nature to which you could scarce give a definite name it wasn t a question of her strange sense for tongues with which she juggled as a conjuror at a show juggled with balls or hoops or lighted brands it wasn t at least entirely that for he had known people almost as polyglot whom their accomplishment had quite failed to make interesting he was polyglot himself for that matter as was the case too with so many of his friends and relations for none of whom more than for himself was it anything but a common convenience the point was that in this young woman it was a beauty in itself and almost a mystery so certainly he had more than once felt in noting on her lips that rarest among the barbarians of all civil graces a perfect felicity in the use of italian he had known strangers a few and mostly men who spoke his own language agreeably but he had known neither man nor woman who showed for it charlotte s almost mystifying instinct he remembered how from the first of their acquaintance she had made no display of it quite as if english between them his english so matching with hers were their inevitable medium he had perceived all by accident by hearing her talk before him to somebody else that they had an alternative as good an alternative in fact as much better as the amusement for him was greater in watching her for the slips that never came her account of the mystery didn t suffice her recall of her birth in florence and florentine childhood her parents from the great country but themselves already of a corrupt generation demoralised falsified polyglot well before her with the tuscan balia who was her first remembrance the servants of the villa the dear contadini of the poder the little girls and the other peasants of the next podere all the rather shabby but still ever so pretty human furniture of her early time including the good sisters of the poor convent of the tuscan hills the convent shabbier than almost anything else but prettier too in which she had been kept at school till the subsequent phase the phase of the much grander institution in paris at which maggie was to arrive terribly frightened and as a smaller girl three years before her own ending of her period of five such reminiscences naturally gave a ground but they had not prevented him from insisting that some strictly civil ancestor generations back and from the tuscan hills if she would made himself felt ineffaceably in her blood and in her tone she knew nothing of the ancestor but she had taken his theory from him gracefully enough as one of the little presents that make friendship flourish these matters however all melted together now though a sense of them was doubtless concerned not unnaturally in the next thing of the nature of a surmise that his discretion let him articulate you haven t i rather gather particularly liked your country they would stick for the time to their english it doesn t i fear seem particularly mine and it doesn t in the least matter over there whether one likes it or not that is to anyone but one s self but i didn t like it said charlotte stant that s not encouraging then to me is it the prince went on do you mean because you re going oh yes of course we re going i ve wanted immensely to go she hesitated but now immediately in a month or two it seems to be the new idea on which there was something in her face as he imagined that made him say didn t maggie write to you not of your going at once but of course you must go and of course you must stay charlotte was easily clear as long as possible is that what you did he laughed you stayed as long as possible well it seemed to me so but i hadn t interests you ll have them on a great scale it s the country for interests said charlotte if i had only had a few i doubtless wouldn t have left it he waited an instant they were still on their feet yours then are rather here oh mine the girl smiled they take up little room wherever they are it determined in him the way this came from her and what it somehow did for her it determined in him a speech that would have seemed a few minutes before precarious and in questionable taste the lead she had given him made the difference and he felt it as really a lift on finding an honest and natural word rise by its license to his lips nothing surely could be for both of them more in the note of a high bravery i ve been thinking it all the while so probable you know that you would have seen your way to marrying she looked at him an instant and just for these seconds he feared for what he might have spoiled to marrying whom why some good kind clever rich american again his security hung in the balance then she was as he felt admirable i tried everyone i came across i did my best i showed i had come quite publicly for that perhaps i showed it too much at any rate it was no use i had to recognise it no one would have me then she seemed to show as sorry for his having to hear of her anything so disconcerting she pitied his feeling about it if he was disappointed she would cheer him up existence you know all the same doesn t depend on that i mean she smiled on having caught a husband oh existence the prince vaguely commented you think i ought to argue for more than mere existence she asked i don t see why my existence even reduced as much as you like to being merely mine should be so impossible there are things of sorts i should be able to have things i should be able to be the position of a single woman to day is very favourable you know favourable to what why just to existence which may contain after all in one way and another so much it may contain at the worst even affections affections in fact quite particularly fixed that is on one s friends i m extremely fond of maggie for instance i quite adore her how could i adore her more if i were married to one of the people you speak of the prince gave a laugh you might adore him more ah but it isn t is it she asked a question of that my dear friend he returned it s always a question of doing the best for one s self one can without injury to others he felt by this time that they were indeed on an excellent basis so he went on again as if to show frankly his sense of its firmness i venture therefore to repeat my hope that you ll marry some capital fellow and also to repeat my belief that such a marriage will be more favourable to you as you call it than even the spirit of the age she looked at him at first only for answer and would have appeared to take it with meekness had she not perhaps appeared a little more to take it with gaiety thank you very much she simply said but at that moment their friend was with them again it was undeniable that as she came in mrs assingham looked with a certain smiling sharpness from one of them to the other the perception of which was perhaps what led charlotte for reassurance to pass the question on the prince hopes so much i shall still marry some good person whether it worked for mrs assingham or not the prince was himself at this more than ever reassured he was safe in a word that was what it all meant and he had required to be safe he was really safe enough for almost any joke it s only he explained to their hostess because of what miss stant has been telling me don t we want to keep up her courage if the joke was broad he had at least not begun it not that is as a joke which was what his companion s address to their friend made of it she has been trying in america she says but hasn t brought it off the tone was somehow not what mrs assingham had expected but she made the best of it well then she replied to the young man if you take such an interest you must bring it off and you must help dear charlotte said unperturbed as you ve helped so beautifully in such things before with which before mrs assingham could meet the appeal she had addressed herself to the prince on a matter much nearer to him your mar riage is on friday on saturday oh on friday no for what do you take us there s not a vulgar omen we re neglecting on saturday please at the oratory at three o clock before twelve assistants exactly twelve including me it struck him he laughed you ll make the thirteenth it won t do not said charlotte if you re going in for omens should you like me to stay away dear no we ll manage we ll make the round number we ll have in some old woman they must keep them there for that don t they mrs assingham s return had at last indicated for him his departure he had possessed himself again of his hat and approached her to take leave but he had another word for charlotte i dine to night with mr verver have you any message the girl seemed to wonder a little for mr verver for maggie about her seeing you early that i know is what she ll like then i ll come early thanks i daresay he went on she ll send for you i mean send a carriage oh i don t require that thanks i can go for a penny can t i she asked of mrs assingham in an omnibus oh i say said the prince while mrs assingham looked at her blandly yes love and i ll give you the penny she shall get there the good lady added to their friend but charlotte as the latter took leave of her thought of something else there s a great favour prince that i want to ask of you i want between this and saturday to make maggie a marriage present oh i say the young man again soothingly exclaimed ah but i must she went on it s really almost for that i came back it was impossible to get in america what i wanted mrs assingham showed anxiety what is it then dear you want but the girl looked only at their companion that s what the prince if he ll be so good must help me to decide can t i mrs assingham asked help you to decide certainly darling we must talk it well over and she kept her eyes on the prince but i want him if he kindly will to go with me to look i want him to judge with me and choose that if you can spare the hour she said is the great favour i mean he raised his eyebrows at her he wonderfully smiled what you came back from america to ask ah certainly then i must find the hour he wonderfully smiled but it was rather more after all than he had been reckoning with it went somehow so little with the rest that directly for him it wasn t the note of safety it preserved this character at the best but by being the note of publicity quickly quickly however the note of publicity struck him as better than any other in another moment even it seemed positively what he wanted for what so much as publicity put their relation on the right footing by this appeal to mrs assingham it was established as right and she immediately showed that such was her own understanding certainly prince she laughed you must find the hour and it was really so express a license from her as representing friendly judgment public opinion the moral law the margin allowed a husband about to be or whatever that after observing to charlotte that should she come to portland place in the morn ing he would make a point of being there to see her and so easily arrange with her about a time he took his departure with the absolutely confirmed impression of knowing as he put it to himself where he was which was what he had prolonged his visit for he was where he could stay iv i don t quite see my dear colonel assingham said to his wife the night of charlotte s arrival i don t quite see i m bound to say why you take it even at the worst so ferociously hard it isn t your fault after all is it i ll be hanged at any rate if it s mine the hour was late and the young lady who had disembarked at southampton that morning to come up by the steamer special and who had then settled herself at an hotel only to re settle herself a couple of hours later at a private house was by this time they might hope peacefully resting from her exploits there had been two men at dinner rather battered brothers in arms of his own period casually picked up by her host the day before and when the gentlemen after the meal rejoined the ladies in the drawing room charlotte pleading fatigue had already excused herself the beguiled warriors however had stayed till after eleven mrs assingham though finally quite without illusions as she said about the military character was always beguiling to old soldiers and as the colonel had come in before dinner only in time to dress he had not till this moment really been summoned to meet his companion over the situation that as he was now to learn their visitor s advent had created for them it was actually more than midnight the servants had been sent to bed the rattle of the wheels had ceased to come in through a window still open to the august air and robert assingham had been steadily learning all the while what it thus behoved him to know but the words just quoted from him presented themselves for the moment as the essence of his spirit and his attitude he disengaged he would be damned if he didn t they were both phrases he repeatedly used his responsibility the simplest the sanest the most obliging of men he habitually indulged in extravagant language his wife had once told him in relation to his violence of speech that such excesses on his part made her think of a retired general whom she had once seen playing with toy soldiers fighting and winning battles carrying on sieges and annihilating enemies with little fortresses of wood and little armies of tin her husband s exaggerated emphasis was his box of toy soldiers his military game it harmlessly gratified in him for his declining years the military instinct bad words when sufficiently numerous and arrayed in their might could represent battalions squadrons tremendous cannonades and glorious charges of cavalry it was natural it was delightful the romance and for her as well of camp life and of the perpetual booming of guns it was fighting to the end to the death but no one was ever killed less fortunate than she nevertheless in spite of his wealth of expression he had not yet found the image that described her favourite game all he could do was practically to leave it to her emulating her own philosophy he had again and again sat up late to discuss those situations in which her finer consciousness abounded but he had never failed to deny that anything in life anything of hers could be a situation for himself she might be in fifty at once if she liked and it was what women did like at their ease after all there always being when they had too much of any some man as they were well aware to get them out he wouldn t at any price have one of any sort whatever of his own or even be in one along with her he watched her accordingly in her favourite element very much as he had sometimes watched at the aquarium the celebrated lady who in a slight though tight bathing suit turned somersaults and did tricks in the tank of water which looked so cold and uncomfortable to the non amphibious he listened to his companion to night while he smoked his last pipe he watched her through her demonstration quite as if he had paid a shilling but it was true that this being the case he desired the value of his money what was it in the name of wonder that she was so bent on being responsible for what did she pretend was going to happen and what at the worst could the poor girl do even granting she wanted to do anything what at the worst for that matter could she be conceived to have in her head if she had told me the moment she got here mrs assingham replied i shouldn t have my difficulty in finding out but she wasn t so obliging and i see no sign at all of her becoming so what s certain is that she didn t come for nothing she wants she worked it out at her leisure to see the prince again that isn t what troubles me i mean that such a fact as a fact isn t but what i ask myself is what does she want it for what s the good of asking yourself if you know you don t know the colonel sat back at his own ease with an ankle resting on the other knee and his eyes attentive to the good appearance of an extremely slender foot which he kept jerking in its neat integument of fine spun black silk and patent leather it seemed to confess this member to consciousness of military discipline everything about it being as polished and perfect as straight and tight and trim as a soldier on parade it went so far as to imply that someone or other would have got something or other confinement to barracks or suppression of pay if it hadn t been just as it was bob assingham was distinguished altogether by a leanness of person a leanness quite distinct from physical laxity which might have been determined on the part of superior powers by views of transport and accommodation and which in fact verged on the abnormal he did himself as well as his friends mostly knew yet remained hungrily thin with facial with abdominal cavities quite grim in their effect and with a consequent looseness of apparel that combined with a choice of queer light shades and of strange straw like textures of the aspect of chinese mats provocative of wonder at his sources of supply suggested the habit of tropic islands a continual cane bottomed chair a governorship exercised on wide verandahs his smooth round head with the particular shade of its white hair was like a silver pot reversed his cheekbones and the bristle of his moustache were worthy of attila the hun the hollows of his eyes were deep and darksome but the eyes within them were like little blue flowers plucked that morning he knew everything that could be known about life which he regarded as for far the greater part a matter of pecuniary arrangement his wife accused him of a want alike of moral and of intellectual reaction or rather indeed of a complete incapacity for either he never went even so far as to understand what she meant and it didn t at all matter since he could be in spite of the limitation a perfectly social creature the infirmities the predicaments of men neither surprised nor shocked him and indeed which was perhaps his only real loss in a thrifty career scarce even amused he took them for granted without horror classifying them after their kind and calculating results and chances he might in old bewildering climates in old campaigns of cruelty and license have had such revelations and known such amazements that he had nothing more to learn but he was wholly content in spite of his fondness in domestic discussion for the superlative degree and his kindness in the oddest way seemed to have nothing to do with his experience he could deal with things perfectly for all his needs without getting near them this was the way he dealt with his wife a large proportion of whose meanings he knew he could neglect he edited for their general economy the play of her mind just as he edited savingly with the stump of a pencil her redundant telegrams the thing in the world that was least of a mystery to him was his club which he was accepted as perhaps too completely managing and which he managed on lines of perfect penetration his connection with it was really a master piece of editing this was in fact to come back very much the process he might have been proposing to apply to mrs assingham s view of what was now before them that is to their connection with charlotte stant s possibilities they wouldn t lavish on them all their little fortune of curiosity and alarm certainly they wouldn t spend their cherished savings so early in the day he liked charlotte moreover who was a smooth and compact inmate and whom he felt as with her instincts that made against waste much more of his own sort than his wife he could talk with her about fanny almost better than he could talk with fanny about charlotte however he made at present the best of the latter necessity even to the pressing of the question he has been noted as having last uttered if you can t think what to be afraid of wait till you can think then you ll do it much better or otherwise if that s waiting too long find out from her don t try to find out from me ask her herself mrs assingham denied as we know that her husband had a play of mind so that she could on her side treat these remarks only as if they had been senseless physical gestures or nervous facial movements she overlooked them as from habit and kindness yet there was no one to whom she talked so persistently of such intimate things it s her friendship with maggie that s the immense complication because that she audibly mused is so natural then why can t she have come out for it she came out mrs assingham continued to meditate because she hates america there was no place for her there she didn t fit in she wasn t in sympathy no more were the people she saw then it s hideously dear she can t on her means begin to live there not at all as she can in a way here in the way you mean of living with us of living with anyone she can t live by visits alone and she doesn t want to she s too good for it even if she could but she will she must sooner or later stay with them maggie will want her maggie will make her besides she ll want to herself then why won t that do the colonel asked for you to think it s what she has come for how will it do how she went on as without hearing him that s what one keeps feeling why shouldn t it do beautifully that anything of the past she brooded should come back now how will it do how will it do it will do i daresay without your wringing your hands over it when my dear the colonel pursued as he smoked have you ever seen anything of yours anything that you ve done not do ah i didn t do this it brought her answer straight i didn t bring her back did you expect her to stay over there all her days to oblige you not a bit for i shouldn t have minded her coming after their marriage it s her coming this way before to which she added with inconsequence i m too sorry for her of course she can t enjoy it but i don t see what perversity rides her she needn t have looked it all so in the face as she doesn t do it i suppose simply for discipline it s almost that s the bore of it discipline to me perhaps then said bob assingham that s what has been her idea take it for god s sake as discipline to you and have done with it it will do he added for discipline to me as well she was far however from having done with it it was a situation with such different sides as she said and to none of which one could in justice be blind it isn t in the least you know for instance that i believe she s bad never never mrs assingham declared i don t think that of her then why isn t that enough nothing was enough mrs assingham signified but that she should develop her thought she doesn t deliberately intend she doesn t consciously wish the least complication it s perfectly true that she thinks maggie a dear as who doesn t she s incapable of any plan to hurt a hair of her head yet here she is and there they are she wound up her husband again for a little smoked in silence what in the world between them ever took place between charlotte and the prince why nothing except their having to recognise that nothing could that was their little romance it was even their little tragedy but what the deuce did they do do they fell in love with each other but seeing it wasn t possible gave each other up then where was the romance why in their frustration in their having the courage to look the facts in the face what facts the colonel went on well to begin with that of their neither of them having the means to marry if she had had even a little a little i mean for two i believe he would bravely have done it after which as her husband but emitted an odd vague sound she corrected herself i mean if he himself had had only a little or a little more than a little a little for a prince they would have done what they could she did them justice if there had been a way but there wasn t a way and charlotte quite to her honour i consider understood it he had to have money it was a question of life and death it wouldn t have been a bit amusing either to marry him as a pauper i mean leaving him one that was what she had as he had the reason to see and their reason is what you call their romance she looked at him a moment what do you want more didn t he the colonel inquired want anything more or didn t for that matter poor charlotte herself she kept her eyes on him there was a manner in it that half answered they were thoroughly in love she might have been his she checked herself she even for a minute lost herself she might have been anything she liked except his wife but she wasn t said the colonel very smokingly she wasn t mrs assingham echoed the echo not loud but deep filled for a little the room he seemed to listen to it die away then he began again how are you sure she waited before saying but when she spoke it was definite there wasn t time he had a small laugh for her reason he might have expected some other does it take so much time she herself however remained serious it takes more than they had he was detached but he wondered what was the matter with their time after which as remembering it all living it over and piecing it together she only considered you mean that you came in with your idea he demanded it brought her quickly to the point and as if also in a measure to answer herself not a bit of it then but you surely recall she went on the way a year ago everything took place they had parted before he had ever heard of maggie why hadn t he heard of her from charlotte herself because she had never spoken of her is that also the colonel inquired what she has told you i m not speaking his wife returned of what she has told me that s one thing i m speaking of what i know by myself that s another you feel in other words that she lies to you bob assingham more sociably asked she neglected the question treating it as gross she never so much at the time as named maggie it was so positive that it appeared to strike him it s he then who has told you she after a moment admitted it it s he and he doesn t lie no to do him justice i believe he absolutely doesn t if i hadn t believed it mrs assingham declared for her general justification i would have had nothing to do with him that is in this connection he s a gentleman i mean all as much of one as he ought to be and he had nothing to gain that helps she added even a gentleman it was i who named maggie to him a year from last may he had never heard of her before then it s grave said the colonel she hesitated do you mean grave for me oh that everything s grave for you is what we take for granted and are fundamentally talking about it s grave it was for charlotte and it s grave for maggie that is it was when he did see her or when she did see him you don t torment me as much as you would like she presently went on because you think of nothing that i haven t a thousand times thought of and because i think of everything that you never will it would all she recognised have been grave if it hadn t all been right you can t make out she contended that we got to rome before the end of february he more than agreed there s nothing in life my dear that i can make out well there was nothing in life apparently that she at real need couldn t charlotte who had been there that year from early quite from november left suddenly you ll quite remember about the th of april she was to have stayed on she was to have stayed naturally more or less for us and she was to have stayed all the more that the ververs due all winter but delayed week after week in paris were at last really coming they were coming that is maggie was largely to see her and above all to be with her there it was all altered by charlotte s going to florence she went from one day to the other you forget everything she gave her reasons but i thought it odd at the time i had a sense that something must have happened the difficulty was that though i knew a little i didn t know enough i didn t know her relation with him had been as you say a near thing that is i didn t know how near the poor girl s departure was a flight she went to save herself he had listened more than he showed as came out in his tone to save herself well also really i think to save him too i saw it afterwards i see it all now he would have been sorry he didn t want to hurt her oh i daresay the colonel laughed they generally don t at all events his wife pursued she escaped they both did for they had had simply to face it their marriage couldn t be and if that was so the sooner they put the apennines between them the better it had taken them it is true some time to feel this and to find it out they had met constantly and not always publicly all that winter they had met more than was known though it was a good deal known more certainly she said than i then imagined though i don t know what difference it would after all have made with me i liked him i thought him charming from the first of our knowing him and now after more than a year he has done nothing to spoil it and there are things he might have done things that many men easily would therefore i believe in him and i was right at first in knowing i was going to so i haven t and she stated it as she might have quoted from a slate after adding up the items the sum of a column of figures so i haven t i say to myself been a fool well are you trying to make out that i ve said you have all their case wants at any rate bob assingham declared is that you should leave it well alone it s theirs now they ve bought it over the counter and paid for it it has ceased to be yours of which case she asked are you speaking he smoked a minute then with a groan lord are there so many there s maggie s and the prince s and there s the prince s and charlotte s oh yes and then the colonel scoffed there s charlotte s and the prince s there s maggie s and charlotte s she went on and there s also maggie s and mine i think too that there s charlotte s and mine yes she mused charlotte s and mine is certainly a case in short you see there are plenty but i mean she said to keep my head are we to settle them all he inquired to night i should lose it if things had happened otherwise if i had acted with any folly she had gone on in her earnestness unheeding of his question i shouldn t be able to bear that now but my good conscience is my strength no one can accuse me the ververs came on to rome alone charlotte after their days with her in florence had decided about america maggie i daresay had helped her she must have made her a present and a handsome one so that many things were easy charlotte left them came to england joined somebody or other sailed for new york i have still her letter from milan telling me i didn t know at the moment all that was behind it but i felt in it nevertheless the undertaking of a new life certainly in any case it cleared that air i mean the dear old roman in which we were steeped it left the field free it gave me a free hand there was no question for me of anybody else when i brought the two others together more than that there was no question for them so you see she concluded where that puts me she got up on the words very much as if they were the blue daylight towards which through a darksome tunnel she had been pushing her way and the elation in her voice combined with her recovered alertness might have signified the sharp whistle of the train that shoots at last into the open she turned about the room she looked out a moment into the august night she stopped here and there before the flowers in bowls and vases yes it was distinctly as if she had proved what was needing proof as if the issue of her operation had been almost unexpectedly a success old arithmetic had perhaps been fallacious but the new settled the question her husband oddly however kept his place without apparently measuring these results as he had been amused at her intensity so he was not uplifted by her relief his interest might in fact have been more enlisted than he allowed do you mean he presently asked that he had already forgot about charlotte she faced round as if he had touched a spring he wanted to naturally and it was much the best thing he could do she was in possession of the main case as it truly seemed she had it all now he was capable of the effort and he took the best way remember too what maggie then seemed to us she s very nice but she always seems to me more than anything else the young woman who has a million a year if you mean that that s what she especially seemed to him you of course place the thing in your light the effort to forget charlotte couldn t i grant you have been so difficult this pulled her up but for an instant i never said he didn t from the first i never said that he doesn t more and more like maggie s money i never said i shouldn t have liked it myself bob assingham returned he made no movement he smoked another minute how much did maggie know how much she seemed to consider as if it were between quarts and gallons how best to express the quantity she knew what charlotte in florence had told her and what had charlotte told her very little what makes you so sure why this that she couldn t tell her and she explained a little what she meant there are things my dear haven t you felt it yourself coarse as you are that no one could tell maggie there are things that upon my word i shouldn t care to attempt to tell her now the colonel smoked on it she d be so scandalised she d be so frightened she d be in her strange little way so hurt she wasn t born to know evil she must never know it bob assingham had a queer grim laugh the sound of which in fact fixed his wife before him we re taking grand ways to prevent it but she stood there to protest we re not taking any ways the ways are all taken they were taken from the moment he came up to our carriage that day in villa borghese the second or third of her days in rome when as you remember you went off somewhere with mr verver and the prince who had got into the carriage with us came home with us to tea they had met they had seen each other well they were in relation the rest was to come of itself and as it could it began practically i recollect in our drive maggie happened to learn by some other man s greeting of him in the bright roman way from a streetcorner as we passed that one of the prince s baptismal names the one always used for him among his relations was amerigo which as you probably don t know however even after a lifetime of me was the name four hundred years ago or whenever of the pushing man who followed across the sea in the wake of columbus and succeeded where columbus had failed in becoming godfather or name father to the new continent so that the thought of any connection with him can even now thrill our artless breasts the colonel s grim placidity could always quite adequately meet his wife s not infrequent imputation of ignorances on the score of the land of her birth unperturbed and unashamed and these dark depths were even at the present moment not directly lighted by an inquiry that managed to be curious without being apologetic but where does the connection come in his wife was prompt by the women that is by some obliging woman of old who was a descendant of the pushing man the make believe discoverer and whom the prince is therefore luckily able to refer to as an ancestress a branch of the other family had become great great enough at least to marry into his and the name of the navigator crowned with glory was very naturally to become so the fashion among them that some son of every generation was appointed to wear it my point is at any rate that i recall noticing at the time how the prince was from the start helped with the dear ververs by his wearing it the connection became romantic for maggie the moment she took it in she filled out in a flash every link that might be vague by that sign i quite said to myself he ll conquer with his good fortune of course of having the other necessary signs too it really said mrs assingham was practically the fine side of the wedge which struck me as also she wound up a lovely note for the candour of the ververs the colonel took in the tale but his comment was prosaic he knew amerigo what he was about and i don t mean the old one i know what you mean his wife bravely threw off the old one he pointed his effect isn t the only discoverer in the family oh as much as you like if he discovered america or got himself honoured as if he had his successors were in due time to discover the americans and it was one of them in particular doubtless who was to discover how patriotic we are wouldn t this be the same one the colonel asked who really discovered what you call the connection she gave him a look the connection s a true thing the connection s perfectly historic your insinuations recoil upon your cynical mind don t you understand she asked that the history of such people is known root and branch at every moment of its course oh it s all right said bob assingham go to the british museum his companion continued with spirit and what am i to do there there s a whole immense room or recess or department or whatever filled with books written about his family alone you can see for yourself have you seen for your self she faltered but an instant certainly i went one day with maggie we looked him up so to say they were most civil and she fell again into the current her husband had slightly ruffled the effect was produced the charm began to work at all events in rome from that hour of the prince s drive with us my only course afterwards had to be to make the best of it it was certainly good enough for that mrs assingham hastened to add and i didn t in the least see my duty in making the worst in the same situation to day i wouldn t act differently i entered into the case as it then appeared to me and as for the matter of that it still does i liked it i thought all sorts of good of it and nothing can even now she said with some intensity make me think anything else nothing can ever make you think anything you don t want to the colonel still in his chair remarked over his pipe you ve got a precious power of thinking whatever you do want you want also from moment to moment to think such desperately different things what happened he went on was that you fell violently in love with the prince yourself and that as you couldn t get me out of the way you had to take some roundabout course you couldn t marry him any more than charlotte could that is not to yourself but you could to somebody else it was always the prince it was always marriage you could to your little friend to whom there were no objections not only there were no objections but there were reasons positive ones and all excellent all charming she spoke with an absence of all repudiation of his exposure of the spring of her conduct and this abstention clearly and effectively conscious evidently cost her nothing it is always the prince and it is always thank heaven marriage and these are the things god grant that it will always be that i could help a year ago most assuredly made me happy and it continues to make me happy then why aren t you quiet i am quiet said fanny assingham he looked at her with his colourless candour still in his place she moved about again a little emphasising by her unrest her declaration of her tranquillity he was as silent at first as if he had taken her answer but he was not to keep it long what do you make of it that by your own show charlotte couldn t tell her all what do you make of it that the prince didn t tell her anything say one understands that there are things she can t be told since as you put it she is so easily scared and shocked he produced these objections slowly giving her time by his pauses to stop roaming and come back to him but she was roaming still when he concluded his inquiry if there hadn t been anything there shouldn t have been between the pair before charlotte bolted in order precisely as you say that there shouldn t be why in the world was what there had been too bad to be spoken of mrs assingham after this question continued still to circulate not directly meeting it even when at last she stopped i thought you wanted me to be quiet so i do and i m trying to make you so much so that you won t worry more can t you be quiet on that she thought a moment then seemed to try to relate that she had to bolt for the reasons we speak of even though the bolting had done for her what she wished that i can perfectly feel charlotte s not wanting to do ah then if it has done for her what she wished but the colonel s conclusion hung by the if which his wife didn t take up so it hung but the longer when he presently spoke again all one wonders in that case is why then she has come back to him say she hasn t come back to him not really to him i ll say anything you like but that won t do me the same good as your saying it nothing my dear will do you good mrs assingham returned you don t care for anything in itself you care for nothing but to be grossly amused because i don t keep washing my hands i thought your whole argument was that everything is so right that this is precisely what you do but his wife as it was a point she had often made could go on as she had gone on before you re perfectly indifferent really you re perfectly immoral you ve taken part in the sack of cities and i m sure you ve done dreadful things yourself but i don t trouble my head if you like so now there she laughed he accepted her laugh but he kept his way well i back poor charlotte back her to know what she wants ah then so do i she does know what she wants and mrs assingham produced this quantity at last on the girl s behalf as the ripe result of her late wanderings and musings she had groped through their talk for the thread and now she had got it she wants to be magnificent she is said the colonel almost cynically she wants his wife now had it fast to be thoroughly superior and she s capable of that of wanting to of carrying out her idea and what is her idea to see maggie through bob assingham wondered through what through everything she knows the prince and maggie doesn t no dear thing mrs assingham had to recognise it she doesn t so that charlotte has come out to give her lessons she continued fanny assingham to work out her thought she has done this great thing for him that is a year ago she practically did it she practically at any rate helped him to do it himself and helped me to help him she kept off she stayed away she left him free and what moreover were her silences to maggie but a direct aid to him if she had spoken in florence if she had told her own poor story if she had come back at any time till within a few weeks ago if she hadn t gone to new york and hadn t held out there if she hadn t done these things all that has happened since would certainly have been different therefore she s in a position to be consistent now she knows the prince mrs assingham repeated it involved even again her former recognition and maggie dear thing doesn t she was high she was lucid she was almost inspired and it was but the deeper drop therefore to her husband s flat common sense in other words maggie is by her ignorance in danger then if she s in danger there is danger there won t be with charlotte s understanding of it that s where she has had her conception of being able to be heroic of being able in fact to be sublime she is she will be the good lady by this time glowed so she sees it to become for her best friend an element of positive safety bob assingham looked at it hard which of them do you call her best friend she gave a toss of impatience i ll leave you to discover but the grand truth thus made out she had now completely adopted it s for us therefore to be hers hers you and i it s for us to be charlotte s it s for us on our side to see her through through her sublimity through her noble lonely life only that s essential it mustn t be lonely it will be all right if she marries so we re to marry her we re to marry her it will be mrs assingham continued the great thing i can do she made it out more and more it will make up make up for what as she said nothing however his desire for lucidity renewed itself if everything s so all right what is there to make up for why if i did do either of them by any chance a wrong if i made a mistake you ll make up for it by making another and then as she again took her time i thought your whole point is just that you re sure one can never be ideally sure of anything there are always possibilities then if we can but strike so wild why keep meddling it made her again look at him where would you have been my dear if i hadn t meddled with you ah that wasn t meddling i was your own i was your own said the colonel from the moment i didn t object well these people won t object they are my own too in the sense that i m awfully fond of them also in the sense she continued that i think they re not so very much less fond of me our relation all round exists it s a reality and a very good one we re mixed up so to speak and it s too late to change it we must live in it and with it therefore to see that charlotte gets a good husband as soon as possible that as i say will be one of my ways of living it will cover she said with conviction all the ground and then as his own conviction appeared to continue as little to match the ground i mean of any nervousness i may ever feel it will be in fact my duty and i shan t rest till my duty s performed she had arrived by this time at something like exaltation i shall give for the next year or two if necessary my life to it i shall have done in that case what i can he took it at last as it came you hold there s no limit to what you can i don t say there s no limit or anything of the sort i say there are good chances enough of them for hope why shouldn t there be when a girl is after all all that she is by after all you mean after she s in love with somebody else the colonel put his question with a quietude doubtless designed to be fatal but it scarcely pulled her up she s not too much in love not herself to want to marry she would now particularly like to has she told you so not yet it s too soon but she will meanwhile however i don t require the information her marrying will prove the truth and what truth the truth of everything i say prove it to whom well to myself to begin with that will be enough for me to work for her what it will prove mrs assingham presently went on will be that she s cured that she accepts the situation he paid this the tribute of a long pull at his pipe the situation of doing the one thing she can that will really seem to cover her tracks his wife looked at him the good dry man as if now at last he was merely vulgar the one thing she can do that will really make new tracks altogether the thing that before any other will be wise and right the thing that will best give her her chance to be magnificent he slowly emitted his smoke and best give you by the same token yours to be magnificent with her i shall be as magnificent at least as i can bob assingham got up and you call me immoral she hesitated i ll call you stupid if you prefer but stupidity pushed to a certain point is you know immorality just so what is morality but high intelligence this he was unable to tell her which left her more definitely to conclude besides it s all at the worst great fun oh if you simply put it at that his implication was that in this case they had a common ground yet even thus he couldn t catch her by it oh i don t mean she said from the threshold the fun that you mean good night in answer to which as he turned out the electric light he gave an odd short groan almost a grunt he had apparently meant some particular kind v well now i must tell you for i want to be absolutely honest so charlotte spoke a little ominously after they had got into the park i don t want to pretend and i can t pretend a moment longer you may think of me what you will but i don t care i knew i shouldn t and i find now how little i came back for this not really for anything else for this she repeated as under the influence of her tone the prince had already come to a pause for this he spoke as if the particular thing she indicated were vague to him or were rather a quantity that couldn t at the most be much it would be as much however as she should be able to make it to have one hour alone with you it had rained heavily in the night and though the pavements were now dry thanks to a cleansing breeze the august morning with its hovering thick drifting clouds and freshened air was cool and grey the multitudinous green of the park had been deepened and a wholesome smell of irrigation purging the place of dust and of odours less acceptable rose from the earth charlotte had looked about her with expression from the first of their coming in quite as if for a deep greeting for general recognition the day was even in the heart of london of a rich low browed weatherwashed english type it was as if it had been waiting for her as if she knew it placed it loved it as if it were in fact a part of what she had come back for so far as this was the case the impression of course could only be lost on a mere vague italian it was one of those for which you had to be blessedly an american as indeed you had to be blessedly an american for all sorts of things so long as you hadn t blessedly or not to remain in america the prince had by half past ten as also by definite appointment called in cadogan place for mrs assingham s visitor and then after brief delay the two had walked together up sloane street and got straight into the park from knightsbridge the understanding to this end had taken its place after a couple of days as inevitably consequent on the appeal made by the girl during those first moments in mrs assingham s drawing room it was an appeal the couple of days had done nothing to invalidate everything much rather to place in a light and as to which obviously it wouldn t have fitted that anyone should raise an objection who was there for that matter to raise one from the moment mrs assingham informed and apparently not disapproving didn t intervene this the young man had asked himself with a very sufficient sense of what would have made him ridiculous he wasn t going to begin that at least was certain by showing a fear even had fear at first been sharp in him moreover it would already not a little have dropped so happy all round so propitious he quite might have called it had been the effect of this rapid interval the time had been taken up largely by his active reception of his own wedding guests and by maggie s scarce less absorbed entertainment of her friend whom she had kept for hours together in portland place whom she had not as wouldn t have been convenient invited altogether as yet to migrate but who had been present with other persons his contingent at luncheon at tea at dinner at perpetual repasts he had never in his life it struck him had to reckon with so much eating whenever he had looked in if he had not again till this hour save for a minute seen charlotte alone so positively all the while he had not seen even maggie and if therefore he had not seen even maggie nothing was more natural than that he shouldn t have seen charlotte the exceptional minute a mere snatch at the tail of the others on the huge portland place staircase had sufficiently enabled the girl to remind him so ready she assumed him to be of what they were to do time pressed if they were to do it at all everyone had brought gifts his relations had brought wonders how did they still have where did they still find such treasures she only had brought nothing and she was ashamed yet even by the sight of the rest of the tribute she wouldn t be put off she would do what she could and he was unknown to maggie he must remember to give her his aid he had prolonged the minute so far as to take time to hesitate for a reason and then to risk bringing his reason out the risk was because he might hurt her hurt her pride if she had that particular sort but she might as well be hurt one way as another and besides that particular sort of pride was just what she hadn t so his slight resistance while they lingered had been just easy enough not to be impossible i hate to encourage you and for such a purpose after all to spend your money she had stood a stair or two below him where while she looked up at him beneath the high domed light of the hall she rubbed with her palm the polished mahogany of the balustrade which was mounted on fine ironwork eighteenth century english because you think i must have so little i ve enough at any rate enough for us to take our hour enough she had smiled is as good as a feast and then she had said it isn t of course a question of anything expensive gorged with treasure as maggie is it isn t a question of competing or outshining what naturally in the way of the priceless hasn t she got mine is to be the offering of the poor something precisely that no rich person could ever give her and that being herself too rich ever to buy it she would therefore never have charlotte had spoken as if after so much thought only as it can t be fine it ought to be funny and that s the sort of thing to hunt for hunting in london besides is amusing in itself he recalled even how he had been struck with her word funny oh i don t mean a comic toy i mean some little thing with a charm but absolutely right in its comparative cheapness that s what i call funny she had explained you used she had also added to help me to get things cheap in rome you were splendid for beating down i have them all still i needn t say the little bargains i there owed you there are bargains in london in august ah but i don t understand your english buying and i confess i find it dull so much as that while they turned to go up together he had objected i understood my poor dear romans it was they who understood you that was your pull she had laughed our amusement here is just that they don t understand us we can make it amusing you ll see if he had hesitated again it was because the point permitted the amusement surely will be to find our present certainly as i say well if they don t come down then we ll come up there s always something to be done besides prince she had gone on i m not if you come to that absolutely a pauper i m too poor for some things she had said yet strange as she was lightly enough but i m not too poor for others and she had paused again at the top i ve been saving up he had really challenged it in america yes even there with my motive and we oughtn t you know she had wound up to leave it beyond to morrow that definitely with ten words more was what had passed he feeling all the while how any sort of begging off would only magnify it he might get on with things as they were but he must do anything rather than magnify besides which it was pitiful to make her beg of him he was making her she had begged and this for a special sensibility in him didn t at all do that was accordingly in fine how they had come to where they were he was engaged as hard as possible in the policy of not magnifying he had kept this up even on her making a point and as if it were almost the whole point that maggie of course was not to have an idea half the interest of the thing at least would be that she shouldn t suspect therefore he was completely to keep it from her as charlotte on her side would that they had been anywhere at all together or had so much as seen each other for five minutes alone the absolute secrecy of their little excursion was in short of the essence she appealed to his kindness to let her feel that he didn t betray her there had been something frankly a little disconcerting in such an appeal at such an hour on the very eve of his nuptials it was one thing to have met the girl casually at mrs assingham s and another to arrange with her thus for a morning practically as private as their old mornings in rome and practically not less intimate he had immediately told maggie the same evening of the minutes that had passed between them in cadogan place though not mentioning those of mrs assingham s absence any more than he mentioned the fact of what their friend had then with such small delay proposed but what had briefly checked his assent to any present to any positive making of mystery what had made him while they stood at the top of the stairs demur just long enough for her to notice it was the sense of the resemblance of the little plan before him to occasions of the past from which he was quite disconnected from which he could only desire to be this was like beginning something over which was the last thing he wanted the strength the beauty of his actual position was in its being wholly a fresh start was that what it began would be new altogether these items of his consciousness had clustered so quickly that by the time charlotte read them in his face he was in presence of what they amounted to she had challenged them as soon as read them had met them with a do you want then to go and tell her that had somehow made them ridiculous it had made him promptly fall back on minimizing it that is on minimizing fuss apparent scruples were obviously fuss and he had on the spot clutched in the light of this truth at the happy principle that would meet every case this principle was simply to be with the girl always simple and with the very last simplicity that would cover everything it had covered then and there certainly his immediate submission to the sight of what was clearest this was really that what she asked was little compared to what she gave what she gave touched him as she faced him for it was the full tune of her renouncing she really renounced renounced everything and without even insisting now on what it had all been for her her only insistence was her insistence on the small matter of their keeping their appointment to themselves that in exchange for everything everything she gave up was verily but a trifle he let himself accordingly be guided he so soon assented for enlightened indulgence to any particular turn she might wish the occasion to take that the stamp of her preference had been well applied to it even while they were still in the park the application in fact presently required that they should sit down a little really to see where they were in obedience to which propriety they had some ten minutes of a quality quite distinct in a couple of penny chairs under one of the larger trees they had taken for their walk to the cropped rain freshened grass after finding it already dry and the chairs turned away from the broad alley the main drive and the aspect of park lane looked across the wide reaches of green which seemed in a manner to refine upon their freedom they helped charlotte thus to make her position her temporary position still more clear and it was for this purpose obviously that abruptly on seeing her opportunity she sat down he stood for a little before her as if to mark the importance of not wasting time the importance she herself had previously insisted on but after she had said a few words it was impossible for him not to resort again to good nature he marked as he could by this concession that if he had finally met her first proposal for what would be amusing in it so any idea she might have would contribute to that effect he had consequently in all consistency to treat it as amusing that she reaffirmed and reaffirmed again the truth that was her truth i don t care what you make of it and i don t ask anything whatever of you anything but this i want to have said it that s all i want not to have failed to say it to see you once and be with you to be as we are now and as we used to be for one small hour or say for two that s what i have had for weeks in my head i mean of course to get it before before what you re going to do so all the while you see she went on with her eyes on him it was a question for me if i should be able to manage it in time if i couldn t have come now i probably shouldn t have come at all perhaps even ever now that i m here i shall stay but there were moments over there when i despaired it wasn t easy there were reasons but it was either this or nothing so i didn t struggle you see in vain after oh i didn t want that i don t mean she smiled that it wouldn t have been delightful to see you even then to see you at any time but i would never have come for it this is different this is what i wanted this is what i ve got this is what i shall always have this is what i should have missed of course she pursued if you had chosen to make me miss it if you had thought me horrid had refused to come i should naturally have been immensely sold i had to take the risk well you re all i could have hoped that s what i was to have said i didn t want simply to get my time with you but i wanted you to know i wanted you she kept it up slowly softly with a small tremor of voice but without the least failure of sense or sequence i wanted you to understand i wanted you that is to hear i don t care i think whether you understand or not if i ask nothing of you i don t i mayn t ask even so much as that what you may think of me that doesn t in the least matter what i want is that it shall always be with you so that you ll never be able quite to get rid of it that i did i won t say that you did you may make as little of that as you like but that i was here with you where we are and as we are i just saying this giving myself in other words away and perfectly willing to do it for nothing that s all she paused as if her demonstration was complete yet for the moment without moving as if in fact to give it a few minutes to sink in into the listening air into the watching space into the conscious hospitality of nature so far as nature was all londonised all vulgarised with them there or even for that matter into her own open ears rather than into the attention of her passive and prudent friend his attention had done all that attention could do his handsome slightly anxious yet still more definitely amused face sufficiently played its part he clutched however at what he could best clutch at the fact that she let him off definitely let him off she let him off it seemed even from so much as answering so that while he smiled back at her in return for her information he felt his lips remain closed to the successive vaguenesses of rejoinder of objection that rose for him from within charlotte herself spoke again at last you may want to know what i get by it but that s my own affair he really didn t want to know even this or continued for the safest plan quite to behave as if he didn t which prolonged the mere dumbness of diversion in which he had taken refuge he was glad when finally the point she had wished to make seeming established to her satisfaction they brought to what might pass for a close the moment of his life at which he had had least to say movement and progress after this with more impersonal talk were naturally a relief so that he was not again during their excursion at a loss for the right word the air had been as it were cleared they had their errand itself to discuss and the opportunities of london the sense of the wonderful place the pleasures of prowling there the question of shops of possibilities of particular objects noticed by each in previous prowls each professed surprise at the extent of the other s knowledge the prince in especial wondered at his friend s possession of her london he had rather prized his own possession the guidance he could really often give a cabman it was a whim of his own a part of his anglomania and congruous with that feature which had after all so much more surface than depth when his companion with the memory of other visits and other rambles spoke of places he hadn t seen and things he didn t know he actually felt again as half the effect just a shade humiliated he might even have felt a trifle annoyed if it hadn t been on this spot for his being even more interested it was a fresh light on charlotte and on her curious world quality of which in rome he had had his due sense but which clearly would show larger on the big london stage rome was in comparison a village a family party a little old world spinnet for the fingers of one hand by the time they reached the marble arch it was almost as if she were showing him a new side and that in fact gave amusement a new and a firmer basis the right tone would be easy for putting himself in her hands should they disagree a little frankly and fairly about directions and chances values and authenticities the situation would be quite gloriously saved they were none the less as happened much of one mind on the article of their keeping clear of resorts with which maggie would be acquainted charlotte recalled it as a matter of course named it in time as a condition they would keep away from any place to which he had already been with maggie this made indeed a scant difference for though he had during the last month done few things so much as attend his future wife on her making of purchases the antiquarii as he called them with charlotte had not been the great affair except in bond street really maggie had had no use for them her situation indeed in connection with that order of traffic was full of consequences produced by her father s mr verver one of the great collectors of the world hadn t left his daughter to prowl for herself he had little to do with shops and was mostly as a purchaser approached privately and from afar great people all over europe sought introductions to him high personages incredibly high and more of them than would ever be known solemnly sworn as everyone was in such cases to discretion high personages made up to him as the one man on the short authentic list likely to give the price it had therefore been easy to settle as they walked that the tracks of the ververs daughter s as well as father s were to be avoided the importance only was that their talk about it led for a moment to the first words they had as yet exchanged on the subject of maggie charlotte still in the park proceeded to them for it was she who began with a serenity of appreciation that was odd certainly as a sequel to her words of ten minutes before this was another note on her what he would have called another light for her companion who though without giving a sign admired for what it was the simplicity of her transition a transition that took no trouble either to trace or to explain itself she paused again an instant on the grass to make it she stopped before him with a sudden anything of course dear as she is will do for her i mean if i were to give her a pin cushion from the baker street bazaar that s exactly what i meant the prince laughed out this allusion to their snatch of talk in portland place it s just what i suggested she took however no notice of the reminder she went on in her own way but it isn t a reason in that case one would never do anything for her i mean charlotte explained if one took advantage of her character of her character we mustn t take advantage of her character the girl again unheeding pursued one mustn t if not for her at least for one s self she saves one such trouble she had spoken thoughtfully with her eyes on her friend s she might have been talking preoccupied and practical of someone with whom he was comparatively unconnected she certainly gives one no trouble said the prince and then as if this were perhaps ambiguous or inadequate she s not selfish god forgive her enough that s what i mean charlotte instantly said she s not selfish enough there s nothing absolutely that one need do for her she s so modest she developed she doesn t miss things i mean if you love her or rather i should say if she loves you she lets it go the prince frowned a little as a tribute after all to seriousness she lets what anything anything that you might do and that you don t she lets everything go but her own disposition to be kind to you it s of herself that she asks efforts so far as she ever has to ask them she hasn t much she does everything herself and that s terrible the prince had listened but always with propriety he didn t commit himself terrible well unless one is almost as good as she it makes too easy terms for one it takes stuff within one so far as one s decency is concerned to stand it and nobody charlotte continued in the same manner is decent enough good enough to stand it not without help from religion or something of that kind not without prayer and fasting that is without taking great care certainly she said such people as you and i are not the prince obligingly thought an instant not good enough to stand it well not good enough not rather to feel the strain we happen each i think to be of the kind that are easily spoiled her friend again for propriety followed the argument oh i don t know may not one s affection for her do something more for one s decency as you call it than her own generosity her own affection her decency has the unfortunate virtue to undo ah of course it must be all in that but she had made her question all the same interesting to him what it comes to one can see what you mean is the way she believes in one that is if she believes at all yes that s what it comes to said charlotte stant and why he asked almost soothingly should it be terrible he couldn t at the worst see that because it s always so the idea of having to pity people not when there s also with it the idea of helping them yes but if we can t help them we can we always can that is he competently added if we care for them and that s what we re talking about yes she on the whole assented it comes back then to our absolutely refusing to be spoiled certainly but everything the prince laughed as they went on all your decency i mean comes back to that she walked beside him a moment it s just what i meant she then reasonably said vi the man in the little shop in which well after this they lingered longest the small but interesting dealer in the bloomsbury street who was remarkable for an insistence not importunate inasmuch as it was mainly mute but singularly intensely coercive this personage fixed on his visitors an extraordinary pair of eyes and looked from one to the other while they considered the object with which he appeared mainly to hope to tempt them they had come to him last for their time was nearly up an hour of it at least from the moment of their getting into a hansom at the marble arch having yielded no better result than the amusement invoked from the first the amusement of course was to have consisted in seeking but it had also involved the idea of finding which latter necessity would have been obtrusive only if they had found too soon the question at present was if they were finding and they put it to each other in the bloomsbury shop while they enjoyed the undiverted attention of the shopman he was clearly the master and devoted to his business the essence of which in his conception might precisely have been this particular secret that he possessed for worrying the customer so little that it fairly made for their relations a sort of solemnity he had not many things none of the redundancy of rot they had elsewhere seen and our friends had on entering even had the sense of a muster so scant that as high values obviously wouldn t reign the effect might be almost pitiful then their impression had changed for though the show was of small pieces several taken from the little window and others extracted from a cupboard behind the counter dusky in the rather low browed place despite its glass doors each bid for their attention spoke however modestly for itself and the pitch of their entertainer s pretensions was promptly enough given his array was heterogeneous and not at all imposing still it differed agreeably from what they had hitherto seen charlotte after the incident was to be full of impressions of several of which later on she gave her companion always in the interest of their amusement the benefit and one of the impressions had been that the man himself was the greatest curiosity they had looked at the prince was to reply to this that he himself hadn t looked at him as precisely in the general connection charlotte had more than once from other days noted for his advantage her consciousness of how below a certain social plane he never saw one kind of shopman was just like another to him which was oddly inconsequent on the part of a mind that where it did notice noticed so much he took throughout always the meaner sort for granted the night of their meanness or whatever name one might give it for him made all his cats grey he didn t no doubt want to hurt them but he imaged them no more than if his eyes acted only for the level of his own high head her own vision acted for every relation this he had seen for himself she remarked beggars she remembered servants she recognised cabmen she had often distinguished beauty when out with him in dirty children she had admired type in faces at hucksters stalls therefore on this occasion she had found their antiquario interesting partly because he cared so for his things and partly because he cared well so for them he likes his things he loves them she was to say and it isn t only it isn t perhaps even at all that he loves to sell them i think he would love to keep them if he could and he prefers at any rate to sell them to right people we clearly were right people he knows them when he sees them and that s why as i say you could make out or at least i could that he cared for us didn t you see she was to ask it with an insistence the way he looked at us and took us in i doubt if either of us have ever been so well looked at before yes he ll remember us she was to profess herself convinced of that almost to uneasiness but it was after all this was perhaps reassuring because given his taste since he has taste he was pleased with us he was struck he had ideas about us well i should think people might we re beautiful aren t we and he knows then also he has his way for that way of saying nothing with his lips when he s all the while pressing you so with his face which shows how he knows you feel it that is a regular way of decent old gold old silver old bronze of old chased and jewelled artistry were the objects that successively produced had ended by numerously dotting the counter where the shopman s slim light fingers with neat nails touched them at moments briefly nervously tenderly as those of a chess player rest a few seconds over the board on a figure he thinks he may move and then may not small florid ancientries ornaments pendants lockets brooches buckles pretexts for dim brilliants bloodless rubies pearls either too large or too opaque for value miniatures mounted with diamonds that had ceased to dazzle snuffboxes presented to or by the too questionable great cups trays taper stands suggestive of pawn tickets archaic and brown that would themselves if preserved have been prized curiosities a few commemorative medals of neat outline but dull reference a classic monument or two things of the first years of the century things consular napoleonic temples obelisks arches tinily re embodied completed the discreet cluster in which however even after tentative reinforcement from several quaint rings intaglios amethysts carbuncles each of which had found a home in the ancient sallow satin of some weakly snapping little box there was in spite of the due proportion of faint poetry no great force of persuasion they looked the visitors they touched they vaguely pretended to consider but with scepticism so far as courtesy permitted in the quality of their attention it was impossible they shouldn t after a little tacitly agree as to the absurdity of carrying to maggie a token from such a stock it would be that was the difficulty pretentious without being good too usual as a treasure to have been an inspiration of the giver and yet too primitive to be taken as tribute welcome on any terms they had been out more than two hours and evidently had found nothing it forced from charlotte a kind of admission it ought really if it should be a thing of this sort to take its little value from having belonged to one s self ecco said the prince just triumphantly enough there you are behind the dealer were sundry small cupboards in the wall two or three of these charlotte had seen him open so that her eyes found themselves resting on those he had not visited but she completed her admission there s nothing here she could wear it was only after a moment that her companion rejoined is there anything do you think that you could it made her just start she didn t at all events look at the objects she but looked for an instant very directly at him no ah the prince quietly exclaimed would it be charlotte asked your idea to offer me something well why not as a small ricordo but a ricordo of what why of this as you yourself say of this little hunt oh i say it but hasn t my whole point been that i don t ask you to therefore she demanded but smiling at him now where s the logic oh the logic he laughed but logic s everything that at least is how i feel it a ricordo from you from you to me is a ricordo of nothing it has no reference ah my dear he vaguely protested their entertainer meanwhile stood there with his eyes on them and the girl though at this minute more interested in her passage with her friend than in anything else again met his gaze it was a comfort to her that their foreign tongue covered what they said and they might have appeared of course as the prince now had one of the snuffboxes in his hand to be discussing a purchase you don t refer she went on to her companion i refer he had lifted the lid of his little box and he looked into it hard do you mean by that then that you would be free free to offer me something this gave her a longer pause and when she spoke again she might have seemed oddly to be addressing the dealer would you allow me no said the prince into his little box you wouldn t accept it from me no he repeated in the same way she exhaled a long breath that was like a guarded sigh but you ve touched an idea that has been mine it s what i ve wanted then she added it was what i hoped he put down his box this had drawn his eyes he made nothing clearly of the little man s attention it s what you brought me out for well that s at any rate she returned my own affair but it won t do it won t do cara mia it s impossible it s impossible and he took up one of the brooches she had another pause while the shopman only waited if i were to accept from you one of these charming little ornaments as you suggest what should i do with it he was perhaps at last a little irritated he even as if he might understand looked vaguely across at their host wear it per bacco where then please under my clothes wherever you like but it isn t then if you will he added worth talking about it s only worth talking about mio caro she smiled from your having begun it my question is only reasonable so that your idea may stand or fall by your answer to it if i should pin one of these things on for you would it be to your mind that i might go home and show it to maggie as your present they had had between them often in talk the refrain jocosely descriptively applied of old roman it had been as a pleasantry in the other time his explanation to her of everything but nothing truly had even seemed so old roman as the shrug in which he now indulged why in the world not because on our basis it would be impossible to give her an account of the pretext the pretext he wondered the occasion this ramble that we shall have had together and that we re not to speak of oh yes he said after a moment i remember we re not to speak of it that of course you re pledged to and the one thing you see goes with the other so you don t insist he had again at random laid back his trinket with which he quite turned to her a little wearily at last even a little impatiently i don t insist it disposed for the time of the question but what was next apparent was that it had seen them no further the shopman who had not stirred stood there in his patience which his mute intensity helping had almost the effect of an ironic comment the prince moved to the glass door and his back to the others as with nothing more to contribute looked though not less patiently into the street then the shopman for charlotte momentously broke silence you ve seen disgraziatamente signora principessa he sadly said too much and it made the prince face about for the effect of the momentous came if not from the sense from the sound of his words which was that of the suddenest sharpest italian charlotte exchanged with her friend a glance that matched it and just for the minute they were held in check but their glance had after all by that time said more than one thing had both exclaimed on the apprehension by the wretch of their intimate conversation let alone of her possible her impossible title and remarked for mutual reassurance that it didn t all the same matter the prince remained by the door but immediately addressing the speaker from where he stood you re italian then are you but the reply came in english oh dear no you re english to which the answer was this time with a smile in briefest italian che the dealer waived the question he practically disposed of it by turning straightway toward a receptacle to which he had not yet resorted and from which after unlocking it he extracted a square box of some twenty inches in height covered with worn looking leather he placed the box on the counter pushed back a pair of small hooks lifted the lid and removed from its nest a drinking vessel larger than a common cup yet not of exorbitant size and formed to appearance either of old fine gold or of some material once richly gilt he handled it with tenderness with ceremony making a place for it on a small satin mat my golden bowl he observed and it sounded on his lips as if it said everything he left the important object for as important it did somehow present itself to produce its certain effect simple but singularly elegant it stood on a circular foot a short pedestal with a slightly spreading base and though not of signal depth justified its title by the charm of its shape as well as by the tone of its surface it might have been a large goblet diminished to the enhancement of its happy curve by half its original height as formed of solid gold it was impressive it seemed indeed to warn off the prudent admirer charlotte with care immediately took it up while the prince who had after a minute shifted his position again regarded it from a distance it was heavier than charlotte had thought gold really gold she asked of their companion he hesitated look a little and perhaps you ll make out she looked holding it up in both her fine hands turning it to the light it may be cheap for what it is but it will be dear i m afraid for me well said the man i can part with it for less than its value i got it you see for less for how much then again he waited always with his serene stare do you like it then charlotte turned to her friend do you like it he came no nearer he looked at their companion cos e well signori miei if you must know it s just a perfect crystal of course we must know per dio said the prince but he turned away again he went back to his glass door charlotte set down the bowl she was evidently taken do you mean it s cut out of a single crystal if it isn t i think i can promise you that you ll never find any joint or any piecing she wondered even if i were to scrape off the gold he showed though with due respect that she amused him you couldn t scrape it off it has been too well put on put on i don t know when and i don t know how but by some very fine old worker and by some beautiful old process charlotte frankly charmed with the cup smiled back at him now a lost art call it a lost art but of what time then is the whole thing well say also of a lost time the girl considered then if it s so precious how comes it to be cheap her interlocutor once more hung fire but by this time the prince had lost patience i ll wait for you out in the air he said to his companion and though he spoke without irritation he pointed his remark by passing immediately into the street where during the next minutes the others saw him his back to the shopwindow philosophically enough hover and light a fresh cigarette charlotte even took a little her time she was aware of his funny italian taste for london street life her host meanwhile at any rate answered her question ah i ve had it a long time without selling it i think i must have been keeping it madam for you you ve kept it for me because you ve thought i mightn t see what s the matter with it he only continued to face her he only continued to appear to follow the play of her mind what is the matter with it oh it s not for me to say it s for you honestly to tell me of course i know something must be but if it s something you can t find out isn t it as good as if it were nothing i probably should find out as soon as i had paid for it not her host lucidly insisted if you hadn t paid too much what do you call she asked little enough well what should you say to fifteen pounds i should say said charlotte with the utmost promptitude that it s altogether too much the dealer shook his head slowly and sadly but firmly it s my price madam and if you admire the thing i think it really might be yours it s not too much it s too little it s almost nothing i can t go lower charlotte wondering but resisting bent over the bowl again then it s impossible it s more than i can afford ah the man returned one can sometimes afford for a present more than one can afford for one s self he said it so coaxingly that she found herself going on without as might be said putting him in his place oh of course it would be only for a present then it would be a lovely one does one make a present she asked of an object that contains to one s knowledge a flaw well if one knows of it one has only to mention it the good faith the man smiled is always there and leave the person to whom one gives the thing you mean to discover it he wouldn t discover it if you re speaking of a gentleman i m not speaking of anyone in particular charlotte said well whoever it might be he might know and he might try but he wouldn t find she kept her eyes on him as if though unsatisfied mystified she yet had a fancy for the bowl not even if the thing should come to pieces and then as he was silent not even if he should have to say to me the golden bowl is broken he was still silent after which he had his strangest smile ah if anyone should want to smash it she laughed she almost admired the little man s expression you mean one could smash it with a hammer yes if nothing else would do or perhaps even by dashing it with violence say upon a marble floor oh marble floors but she might have been thinking for they were a connection marble floors a connection with many things with her old rome and with his with the palaces of his past and a little of hers with the possibilities of his future with the sumptuosities of his marriage with the wealth of the ververs all the same however there were other things and they all together held for a moment her fancy does crystal then break when it is crystal i thought its beauty was its hardness her friend in his way discriminated its beauty is its being crystal but its hardness is certainly its safety it doesn t break he went on like vile glass it splits if there is a split ah charlotte breathed with interest if there is a split and she looked down again at the bowl there is a split eh crystal does split eh on lines and by laws of its own you mean if there s a weak place for all answer after an hesitation he took the bowl up again holding it aloft and tapping it with a key it rang with the finest sweetest sound where is the weak place she then did the question justice well for me only the price i m poor you see very poor but i thank you and i ll think the prince on the other side of the shop window had finally faced about and as to see if she hadn t done was trying to reach with his eyes the comparatively dim interior i like it she said i want it but i must decide what i can do the man not ungraciously resigned himself well i ll keep it for you the small quarter of an hour had had its marked oddity this she felt even by the time the open air and the bloomsbury aspects had again in their protest against the truth of her gathered impression made her more or less their own yet the oddity might have been registered as small as compared to the other effect that before they had gone much further she had with her companion to take account of this latter was simply the effect of their having by some tacit logic some queer inevitability quite dropped the idea of a continued pursuit they didn t say so but it was on the line of giving up maggie s present that they practically proceeded the line of giving it up without more reference to it the prince s first reference was in fact quite independently made i hope you satisfied yourself before you had done of what was the matter with that bowl no indeed i satisfied myself of nothing of nothing at least but that the more i looked at it the more i liked it and that if you weren t so unaccommodating this would be just the occasion for your giving me the pleasure of accepting it he looked graver for her at this than he had looked all the morning do you propose it seriously without wishing to play me a trick she wondered what trick would it be he looked at her harder you mean you really don t know but know what why what s the matter with it you didn t see all the while she only continued however to stare how could you see out in the street i saw before i went out it was because i saw that i did go out i didn t want to have another scene with you before that rascal and i judged you would presently guess for yourself is he a rascal charlotte asked his price is so moderate she waited but a moment five pounds really so little five pounds he continued to look at her five pounds he might have been doubting her word but he was only it appeared gathering emphasis it would be dear to make a gift of at five shillings if it had cost you even but five pence i wouldn t take it from you then she asked what is the matter why it has a crack it sounded on his lips so sharp it had such an authority that she almost started while her colour at the word rose it was as if he had been right though his assurance was wonderful you answer for it without having looked i did look i saw the object itself it told its story no wonder it s cheap but it s exquisite charlotte as if with an interest in it now made even tenderer and stranger found herself moved to insist of course it s exquisite that s the danger then a light visibly came to her a light in which her friend suddenly and intensely showed the reflection of it as she smiled at him was in her own face the danger i see is because you re superstitious per dio i m superstitious a crack is a crack and an omen s an omen you d be afraid per bacco for your happiness for my happiness for your safety for my safety she just paused for your marriage for my marriage for everything she thought again thank goodness then that if there be a crack we know it but if we may perish by cracks in things that we don t know and she smiled with the sadness of it we can never then give each other anything he considered but he met it ah but one does know i do at least and by instinct i don t fail that will always protect me it was funny the way he said such things yet she liked him really the more for it they fell in for her with a general or rather with a special vision but she spoke with a mild despair what then will protect me where i m concerned i will from me at least you ve nothing to fear he now quite amiably responded anything you consent to accept from me but he paused well well shall be perfect that s very fine she presently answered it s vain after all for you to talk of my accepting things when you ll accept nothing from me ah there better still he could meet her you attach an impossible condition that i mean of my keeping your gift so to myself well she looked before him there at the condition then abruptly with a gesture she gave it up she had a headshake of disenchantment so far as the idea had appealed to her it all appeared too difficult oh my condition i don t hold to it you may cry it on the housetops anything i ever do ah well then this made he laughed all the difference but it was too late oh i don t care now i should have liked the bowl but if that won t do there s nothing he considered this he took it in looking graver again but after a moment he qualified yet i shall want some day to give you something she wondered at him what day the day you marry for you will marry you must seriously marry she took it from him but it determined in her the only words she was to have uttered all the morning that came out as if a spring had been pressed to make you feel better well he replied frankly wonderfully it will but here he added is your hansom he had signalled the cab was charging she put out no hand for their separation but she prepared to get in before she did so however she said what had been gathering while she waited well i would marry i think to have something from you in all freedom part second vii adam verver at fawns that autumn sunday might have been observed to open the door of the billiard room with a certain freedom might have been observed that is had there been a spectator in the field the justification of the push he had applied however and of the push equally sharp that to shut himself in he again applied the ground of this energy was precisely that he might here however briefly find himself alone alone with the handful of letters newspapers and other unopened missives to which during and since breakfast he had lacked opportunity to give an eye the vast square clean apartment was empty and its large clear windows looked out into spaces of terrace and garden of park and woodland and shining artificial lake of richly condensed horizon all dark blue upland and church towered village and strong cloudshadow which were together a thing to create the sense with everyone else at church of one s having the world to one s self we share this world none the less for the hour with mr verver the very fact of his striking as he would have said for solitude the fact of his quiet flight almost on tiptoe through tortuous corridors investing him with an interest that makes our attention tender indeed almost to compassion qualify his achieved isolation for it may immediately be mentioned that this amiable man bethought himself of his personal advantage in general only when it might appear to him that other advantages those of other persons had successfully put in their claim it may be mentioned also that he always figured other persons such was the law of his nature as a numerous array and that though conscious of but a single near tie one affection one duty deepest rooted in his life it had never for many minutes together been his portion not to feel himself surrounded and committed never quite been his refreshment to make out where the many coloured human appeal represented by gradations of tint diminishing concentric zones of intensity of importunity really faded to the blessed impersonal whiteness for which his vision sometimes ached it shaded off the appeal he would have admitted that but he had as yet noted no point at which it positively stopped thus had grown in him a little habit his innermost secret not confided even to maggie though he felt she understood it as she understood to his view everything thus had shaped itself the innocent trick of occasionally making believe that he had no conscience or at least that blankness in the field of duty did reign for an hour a small game to which the few persons near enough to have caught him playing it and of whom mrs assingham for instance was one attached indulgently that idea of quaintness quite in fact that charm of the pathetic involved in the preservation by an adult of one of childhood s toys when he took a rare moment off he did so with the touching confessing eyes of a man of forty seven caught in the act of handling a relic of infancy sticking on the head of a broken soldier or trying the lock of a wooden gun it was essentially in him the imitation of depravity which for amusement as might have been he practised keeping up in spite of practice he was still imperfect for these so artlessly artful interludes were condemned by the nature of the case to brevity he had fatally stamped himself it was his own fault a man who could be interrupted with impunity the greatest of wonders moreover was exactly in this that so interrupted a man should ever have got as the phrase was should above all have got so early to where he was it argued a special genius he was clearly a case of that the spark of fire the point of light sat somewhere in his inward vagueness as a lamp before a shrine twinkles in the dark perspective of a church and while youth and early middle age while the stiff american breeze of example and opportunity were blowing upon it hard had made of the chamber of his brain a strange workshop of fortune this establishment mysterious and almost anonymous the windows of which at hours of highest pressure never seemed for starers and wonderers perceptibly to glow must in fact have been during certain years the scene of an unprecedented a miraculous white heat the receipt for producing which it was practically felt that the master of the forge could not have communicated even with the best intentions the essential pulse of the flame the very action of the cerebral temperature brought to the highest point yet extraordinarily contained these facts themselves were the immensity of the result they were one with perfection of machinery they had constituted the kind of acquisitive power engendered and applied the necessary triumph of all operations a dim explanation of phenomena once vivid must at all events for the moment suffice us it being obviously no account of the matter to throw on our friend s amiability alone the weight of the demonstration of his economic history amiability of a truth is an aid to success it has even been known to be the principle of large accumulations but the link for the mind is none the less fatally missing between proof on such a scale of continuity if of nothing more insolent in one field and accessibility to distraction in every other variety of imagination what is that but fatal in the world of affairs unless so disciplined as not to be distinguished from monotony mr verver then for a fresh full period a period betraying extraordinarily no wasted year had been inscrutably monotonous behind an iridescent cloud the cloud was his native envelope the soft looseness so to say of his temper and tone not directly expressive enough no doubt to figure an amplitude of folds but of a quality unmistakable for sensitive feelers he was still reduced in fine to getting his rare moments with himself by feigning a cynicism his real inability to maintain the pretence however had perhaps not often been better instanced than by his acceptance of the inevitable to day his acceptance of it on the arrival at the end of a quarter of an hour of that element of obligation with which he had all the while known he must reckon a quarter of an hour of egoism was about as much as he taking one situation with another usually got mrs rance opened the door more tentatively indeed than he himself had just done but on the other hand as if to make up for this she pushed forward even more briskly on seeing him than he had been moved to do on seeing nobody then with force it came home to him that he had definitely a week before established a precedent he did her at least that justice it was a kind of justice he was always doing someone he had on the previous sunday liked to stop at home and he had exposed himself thereby to be caught in the act to make this possible that is mrs rance had only had to like to do the same the trick was so easily played it had not occurred to him to plan in any way for her absence which would have destroyed somehow in principle the propriety of his own presence if persons under his roof hadn t a right not to go to church what became for a fair mind of his own right his subtlest manoeuvre had been simply to change from the library to the billiard room it being in the library that his guest or his daughter s or the guest of the miss lutches he scarce knew in which light to regard her had then and not unnaturally of course joined him it was urged on him by his memory of the duration of the visit she had that time as it were paid him that the law of recurrence would already have got itself enacted she had spent the whole morning with him was still there in the library when the others came back thanks to her having been tepid about their taking mr verver and she a turn outside it had been as if she looked on that as a kind of subterfuge almost as a form of disloyalty yet what was it she had in mind what did she wish to make of him beyond what she had already made a patient punctilious host mindful that she had originally arrived much as a stranger arrived not at all deliberately or yearningly invited so that one positively had her possible susceptibilities the more on one s conscience the miss lutches the sisters from the middle west were there as friends of maggie s friends of the earlier time but mrs rance was there or at least had primarily appeared only as a friend of the miss lutches this lady herself was not of the middle west she rather insisted on it but of new jersey rhode island or delaware one of the smallest and most intimate states he couldn t remember which though she insisted too on that it was not in him we may say it for him to go so far as to wonder if their group were next to be recruited by some friend of her own and this partly because she had struck him verily rather as wanting to get the miss lutches themselves away than to extend the actual circle and partly as well as more essentially because such connection as he enjoyed with the ironic question in general resided substantially less in a personal use of it than in the habit of seeing it as easy to others he was so framed by nature as to be able to keep his inconveniences separate from his resentments though indeed if the sum of these latter had at the most always been small that was doubtless in some degree a consequence of the fewness of the former his greatest inconvenience he would have admitted had he analyzed was in finding it so taken for granted that as he had money he had force it pressed upon him hard and all round assuredly this attribution of power everyone had need of one s power whereas one s own need at the best would have seemed to be but some trick for not communicating it the effect of a reserve so merely so meanly defensive would in most cases beyond question sufficiently discredit the cause wherefore though it was complicating to be perpetually treated as an infinite agent the outrage was not the greatest of which a brave man might complain complaint besides was a luxury and he dreaded the imputation of greed the other the constant imputation that of being able to do would have no ground if he hadn t been to start with this was the point provably luxurious his lips somehow were closed and by a spring connected moreover with the action of his eyes themselves the latter showed him what he had done showed him where he had come out quite at the top of his hill of difficulty the tall sharp spiral round which he had begun to wind his ascent at the age of twenty and the apex of which was a platform looking down if one would on the kingdoms of the earth and with standing room for but half a dozen others his eyes in any case now saw mrs rance approach with an instant failure to attach to the fact any grossness of avidity of mrs rance s own or at least to descry any triumphant use even for the luridest impression of her intensity what was virtually supreme would be her vision of his having attempted by his desertion of the library to mislead her which in point of fact barely escaped being what he had designed it was not easy for him in spite of accumulations fondly and funnily regarded as of systematic practice not now to be ashamed the one thing comparatively easy would be to gloss over his course the billiard room was not at the particular crisis either a natural or a graceful place for the nominally main occupant of so large a house to retire to and this without prejudice either to the fact that his visitor wouldn t as he apprehended explicitly make him a scene should she frankly denounce him for a sneak he would simply go to pieces but he was after an instant not afraid of that wouldn t she rather as emphasising their communion accept and in a manner exploit the anomaly treat it perhaps as romantic or possibly even as comic show at least that they needn t mind even though the vast table draped in brown holland thrust itself between them as an expanse of desert sand she couldn t cross the desert but she could and did beautifully get round it so that for him to convert it into an obstacle he would have had to cause himself as in some childish game or unbecoming romp to be pursued to be genially hunted this last was a turn he was well aware the occasion should on no account take and there loomed before him for the mere moment the prospect of her fairly proposing that they should knock about the balls that danger certainly it struck him he should manage in some way to deal with why too for that matter had he need of defences material or other how was it a question of dangers really to be called such the deep danger the only one that made him as an idea positively turn cold would have been the possibility of her seeking him in marriage of her bringing up between them that terrible issue here fortunately she was powerless it being apparently so provable against her that she had a husband in undiminished existence she had him it was true only in america only in texas in nebraska in arizona or somewhere somewhere that at old fawns house in the county of kent scarcely counted as a definite place at all it showed somehow from afar as so lost so indistinct and illusory in the great alkali desert of cheap divorce she had him even in bondage poor man had him in contempt had him in remembrance so imperfect as barely to assert itself but she had him none the less in existence unimpeached the miss lutches had seen him in the flesh as they had appeared eager to mention though when they were separately questioned their descriptions failed to tally he would be at the worst should it come to the worst mrs rance s difficulty and he served therefore quite enough as the stout bulwark of anyone else this was in truth logic without a flaw yet it gave mr verver less comfort than it ought he feared not only danger he feared the idea of danger or in other words feared hauntedly himself it was above all as a symbol that mrs rance actually rose before him a symbol of the supreme effort that he should have sooner or later as he felt to make this effort would be to say no he lived in terror of having to he should be proposed to at a given moment it was only a question of time and then he should have to do a thing that would be extremely disagreeable he almost wished on occasion that he wasn t so sure he would do it he knew himself however well enough not to doubt he knew coldly quite bleakly where he would at the crisis draw the line it was maggie s marriage and maggie s finer happiness happy as he had supposed her before that had made the difference he hadn t in the other time it now seemed to him had to think of such things they hadn t come up for him and it was as if she positively had herself kept them down she had only been his child which she was indeed as much as ever but there were sides on which she had protected him as if she were more than a daughter she had done for him more than he knew much and blissfully as he always had known if she did at present more than ever through having what she called the change in his life to make up to him for his situation still all the same kept pace with her activity his situation being simply that there was more than ever to be done there had not yet been quite so much on all the showing as since their return from their twenty months in america as since their settlement again in england experimental though it was and the consequent sense now quite established for him of a domestic air that had cleared and lightened producing the effect for their common personal life of wider perspectives and large waiting spaces it was as if his son in law s presence even from before his becoming his son in law had somehow filled the scene and blocked the future very richly and handsomely when all was said not at all inconveniently or in ways not to have been desired inasmuch as though the prince his measure now practically taken was still pretty much the same big fact the sky had lifted the horizon receded the very foreground itself expanded quite to match him quite to keep everything in comfortable scale at first certainly their decent little old time union maggie s and his own had resembled a good deal some pleasant public square in the heart of an old city into which a great palladian church say something with a grand architectural front had suddenly been dropped so that the rest of the place the space in front the way round outside to the east end the margin of street and passage the quantity of over arching heaven had been temporarily compromised not even then of a truth in a manner disconcerting given that is for the critical or at least the intelligent eye the great style of the facade and its high place in its class the phenomenon that had since occurred whether originally to have been pronounced calculable or not had not naturally been the miracle of a night but had taken place so gradually quietly easily that from this vantage of wide wooded fawns with its eighty rooms as they said with its spreading park with its acres and acres of garden and its majesty of artificial lake though that for a person so familiar with the great ones might be rather ridiculous no visibility of transition showed no violence of adjustment in retrospect emerged the palladian church was always there but the piazza took care of itself the sun stared down in his fulness the air circulated and the public not less the limit stood off the way round was easy the east end was as fine in its fashion as the west and there were also side doors for entrance between the two large monumental ornamental in their style as for all proper great churches by some such process in fine had the prince for his father in law while remaining solidly a feature ceased to be at all ominously a block mr verver it may further be mentioned had taken at no moment sufficient alarm to have kept in detail the record of his reassurance but he would none the less not have been unable not really have been indisposed to impart in confidence to the right person his notion of the history of the matter the right person it is equally distinct had not for this illumination been wanting but had been encountered in the form of fanny assingham not for the first time indeed admitted to his counsels and who would have doubtless at present in any case from plenitude of interest and with equal guarantees repeated his secret it all came then the great clearance from the one prime fact that the prince by good fortune hadn t proved angular he clung to that description of his daughter s husband as he often did to terms and phrases in the human the social connection that he had found for himself it was his way to have times of using these constantly as if they just then lighted the world or his own path in it for him even when for some of his interlocutors they covered less ground it was true that with mrs assingham he never felt quite sure of the ground anything covered she disputed with him so little agreed with him so much surrounded him with such systematic consideration such predetermined tenderness that it was almost which he had once told her in irritation as if she were nursing a sick baby he had accused her of not taking him seriously and she had replied as from her it couldn t frighten him that she took him religiously adoringly she had laughed again as she had laughed before on his producing for her that good right word about the happy issue of his connection with the prince with an effect the more odd perhaps as she had not contested its value she couldn t of course however be at the best as much in love with his discovery as he was himself he was so much so that he fairly worked it to his own comfort came in fact sometimes near publicly pointing the moral of what might have occurred if friction so to speak had occurred he pointed it frankly one day to the personage in question mentioned to the prince the particular justice he did him was even explicit as to the danger that in their remarkable relation they had thus escaped oh if he had been angular who could say what might then have happened he spoke and it was the way he had spoken to mrs assingham too as if he grasped the facts without exception for which angularity stood it figured for him clearly as a final idea a conception of the last vividness he might have been signifying by it the sharp corners and hard edges all the stony pointedness the grand right geometry of his spreading palladian church just so he was insensible to no feature of the felicity of a contact that beguilingly almost confoundingly was a contact but with practically yielding lines and curved surfaces you re round my boy he had said you re all you re variously and inexhaustibly round when you might by all the chances have been abominably square i m not sure for that matter he had added that you re not square in the general mass whether abominably or not the abomination isn t a question for you re inveterately round that s what i mean in the detail it s the sort of thing in you that one feels or at least i do with one s hand say you had been formed all over in a lot of little pyramidal lozenges like that wonderful side of the ducal palace in venice so lovely in a building but so damnable for rubbing against in a man and especially in a near relation i can see them all from here each of them sticking out by itself all the architectural cut diamonds that would have scratched one s softer sides one would have been scratched by diamonds doubtless the neatest way if one was to be scratched at all but one would have been more or less reduced to a hash as it is for living with you re a pure and perfect crystal i give you my idea i think you ought to have it just as it has come to me the prince had taken the idea in his way for he was well accustomed by this time to taking and nothing perhaps even could more have confirmed mr verver s account of his surface than the manner in which these golden drops evenly flowed over it they caught in no interstice they gathered in no concavity the uniform smoothness betrayed the dew but by showing for the moment a richer tone the young man in other words unconfusedly smiled though indeed as if assenting from principle and habit to more than he understood he liked all signs that things were well but he cared rather less why they were in regard to the people among whom he had since his marriage been living the reasons they so frequently gave so much oftener than he had ever heard reasons given before remained on the whole the element by which he most differed from them and his father in law and his wife were after all only first among the people among whom he had been living he was never even yet sure of how at this that or the other point he would strike them they felt remarkably so often things he hadn t meant and missed not less remarkably and not less often things he had he had fallen back on his general explanation we haven t the same values by which he understood the same measure of importance his curves apparently were important because they had been unexpected or still more unconceived whereas when one had always as in his relegated old world taken curves and in much greater quantities too for granted one was no more surprised at the resulting feasibility of intercourse than one was surprised at being upstairs in a house that had a staircase he had in fact on this occasion disposed alertly enough of the subject of mr verver s approbation the promptitude of his answer we may in fact well surmise had sprung not a little from a particular kindled remembrance this had given his acknowledgment its easiest turn oh if i m a crystal i m delighted that i m a perfect one for i believe that they sometimes have cracks and flaws in which case they re to be had very cheap he had stopped short of the emphasis it would have given his joke to add that there had been certainly no having him cheap and it was doubtless a mark of the good taste practically reigning between them that mr verver had not on his side either taken up the opportunity it is the latter s relation to such aspects however that now most concerns us and the bearing of his pleased view of this absence of friction upon amerigo s character as a representative precious object representative precious objects great ancient pictures and other works of art fine eminent pieces in gold in silver in enamel majolica ivory bronze had for a number of years so multiplied themselves round him and as a general challenge to acquisition and appreciation so engaged all the faculties of his mind that the instinct the particular sharpened appetite of the collector had fairly served as a basis for his acceptance of the prince s suit over and above the signal fact of the impression made on maggie herself the aspirant to his daughter s hand showed somehow the great marks and signs stood before him with the high authenticities he had learned to look for in pieces of the first order adam verver knew by this time knew thoroughly no man in europe or in america he privately believed was less capable in such estimates of vulgar mistakes he had never spoken of himself as infallible it was not his way but apart from the natural affections he had acquainted himself with no greater joy of the intimately personal type than the joy of his originally coming to feel and all so unexpectedly that he had in him the spirit of the connoisseur he had like many other persons in the course of his reading been struck with keats s sonnet about stout cortez in the presence of the pacific but few persons probably had so devoutly fitted the poet s grand image to a fact of experience it consorted so with mr verver s consciousness of the way in which at a given moment he had stared at his pacific that a couple of perusals of the immortal lines had sufficed to stamp them in his memory his peak in darien was the sudden hour that had transformed his life the hour of his perceiving with a mute inward gasp akin to the low moan of apprehensive passion that a world was left him to conquer and that he might conquer it if he tried it had been a turning of the page of the book of life as if a leaf long inert had moved at a touch and eagerly reversed had made such a stir of the air as sent up into his face the very breath of the golden isles to rifle the golden isles had on the spot become the business of his future and with the sweetness of it what was most wondrous of all still more even in the thought than in the act the thought was that of the affinity of genius or at least of taste with something in himself with the dormant intelligence of which he had thus almost violently become aware and that affected him as changing by a mere revolution of the screw his whole intellectual plane he was equal somehow with the great seers the invokers and encouragers of beauty and he didn t after all perhaps dangle so far below the great producers and creators he had been nothing of that kind before too decidedly too dreadfully not but now he saw why he had been what he had why he had failed and fallen short even in huge success now he read into his career in one single magnificent night the immense meaning it had waited for it was during his first visit to europe after the death of his wife when his daughter was ten years old that the light in his mind had so broken and he had even made out at that time why on an earlier occasion the journey of his honeymoon year it had still been closely covered he had bought then so far as he had been able but he had bought almost wholly for the frail fluttered creature at his side who had had her fancies decidedly but all for the art then wonderful to both of them of the rue de la paix the costly authenticities of dressmakers and jewellers her flutter pale disconcerted ghost as she actually was a broken white flower tied round almost grotesquely for his present sense with a huge satin bow of the boulevard her flutter had been mainly that of ribbons frills and fine fabrics all funny pathetic evidence for memory of the bewilderments overtaking them as a bridal pair confronted with opportunity he could wince fairly still as he remembered the sense in which the poor girl s pressure had under his fond encouragement indeed been exerted in favour of purchase and curiosity these were wandering images out of the earlier dusk that threw her back for his pity into a past more remote than he liked their common past their young affection to appear it would have had to be admitted to an insistent criticism that maggie s mother all too strangely had not so much failed of faith as of the right application of it since she had exercised it eagerly and restlessly made it a pretext for innocent perversities in respect to which philosophic time was at last to reduce all groans to gentleness and they had loved each other so that his own intelligence on the higher line had temporarily paid for it the futilities the enormities the depravities of decoration and ingenuity that before his sense was unsealed she had made him think lovely musing reconsidering little man that he was and addicted to silent pleasures as he was accessible to silent pains he even sometimes wondered what would have become of his intelligence in the sphere in which it was to learn more and more exclusively to play if his wife s influence upon it had not been in the strange scheme of things so promptly removed would she have led him altogether attached as he was to her into the wilderness of mere mistakes would she have prevented him from ever scaling his vertiginous peak or would she otherwise have been able to accompany him to that eminence where he might have pointed out to her as cortez to his companions the revelation vouchsafed no companion of cortez had presumably been a real lady mr verver allowed that historic fact to determine his inference viii what was at all events not permanently hidden from him was a truth much less invidious about his years of darkness it was the strange scheme of things again the years of darkness had been needed to render possible the years of light a wiser hand than he at first knew had kept him hard at acquisition of one sort as a perfect preliminary to acquisition of another and the preliminary would have been weak and wanting if the good faith of it had been less his comparative blindness had made the good faith which in its turn had made the soil propitious for the flower of the supreme idea he had had to like forging and sweating he had had to like polishing and piling up his arms they were things at least he had had to believe he liked just as he had believed he liked transcendent calculation and imaginative gambling all for themselves the creation of interests that were the extinction of other interests the livid vulgarity even of getting in or getting out first that had of course been so far from really the case with the supreme idea all the while growing and striking deep under everything in the warm rich earth he had stood unknowing he had walked and worked where it was buried and the fact itself the fact of his fortune would have been a barren fact enough if the first sharp tender shoot had never struggled into day there on one side was the ugliness his middle time had been spared there on the other from all the portents was the beauty with which his age might still be crowned he was happier doubtless than he deserved but that when one was happy at all it was easy to be he had wrought by devious ways but he had reached the place and what would ever have been straighter in any man s life than his way now of occupying it it hadn t merely his plan all the sanctions of civilization it was positively civilization condensed concrete consummate set down by his hands as a house on a rock a house from whose open doors and windows open to grateful to thirsty millions the higher the highest knowledge would shine out to bless the land in this house designed as a gift primarily to the people of his adoptive city and native state the urgency of whose release from the bondage of ugliness he was in a position to measure in this museum of museums a palace of art which was to show for compact as a greek temple was compact a receptacle of treasures sifted to positive sanctity his spirit to day almost altogether lived making up as he would have said for lost time and haunting the portico in anticipation of the final rites these would be the opening exercises the august dedication of the place his imagination he was well aware got over the ground faster than his judgment there was much still to do for the production of his first effect foundations were laid and walls were rising the structure of the shell all determined but raw haste was forbidden him in a connection so intimate with the highest effects of patience and piety he should belie himself by completing without a touch at least of the majesty of delay a monument to the religion he wished to propagate the exemplary passion the passion for perfection at any price he was far from knowing as yet where he would end but he was admirably definite as to where he wouldn t begin he wouldn t begin with a small show he would begin with a great and he could scarce have indicated even had he wished to try the line of division he had drawn he had taken no trouble to indicate it to his fellow citizens purveyors and consumers in his own and the circumjacent commonwealths of comic matter in large lettering diurnally set up printed published folded and delivered at the expense of his presumptuous emulation of the snail the snail had become for him under this ironic suggestion the loveliest beast in nature and his return to england of which we are present witnesses had not been unconnected with the appreciation so determined it marked what he liked to mark that he needed on the matter in question instruction from no one on earth a couple of years of europe again of renewed nearness to changes and chances refreshed sensibility to the currents of the market would fall in with the consistency of wisdom the particular shade of enlightened conviction that he wished to observe it didn t look like much for a whole family to hang about waiting they being now since the birth of his grandson a whole family and there was henceforth only one ground in all the world he felt on which the question of appearance would ever really again count for him he cared that a work of art of price should look like the master to whom it might perhaps be deceitfully attributed but he had ceased on the whole to know any matter of the rest of life by its looks he took life in general higher up the stream so far as he was not actually taking it as a collector he was taking it decidedly as a grandfather in the way of precious small pieces he had handled nothing so precious as the principino his daughter s first born whose italian designation endlessly amused him and whom he could manipulate and dandle already almost toss and catch again as he couldn t a correspondingly rare morsel of an earlier pate tendre he could take the small clutching child from his nurse s arms with an iteration grimly discountenanced in respect to their contents by the glass doors of high cabinets something clearly beatific in this new relation had moreover without doubt confirmed for him the sense that none of his silent answers to public detraction to local vulgarity had ever been so legitimately straight as the mere element of attitude reduce it he said to that in his easy weeks at fawns the element of attitude was all he wanted of these weeks and he was enjoying it on the spot even more than he had hoped enjoying it in spite of mrs rance and the miss lutches in spite of the small worry of his belief that fanny assingham had really something for him that she was keeping back in spite of his full consciousness overflowing the cup like a wine too generously poured that if he had consented to marry his daughter and thereby to make as it were the difference what surrounded him now was exactly consent vivified marriage demonstrated the difference in fine definitely made he could call back his prior his own wedded consciousness it was not yet out of range of vague reflection he had supposed himself above all he had supposed his wife as married as anyone could be and yet he wondered if their state had deserved the name or their union worn the beauty in the degree to which the couple now before him carried the matter in especial since the birth of their boy in new york the grand climax of their recent american period brought to so right an issue the happy pair struck him as having carried it higher deeper further to where it ceased to concern his imagination at any rate to follow them extraordinary beyond question was one branch of his characteristic mute wonderment it characterised above all with its subject before it his modesty the strange dim doubt waking up for him at the end of the years of whether maggie s mother had after all been capable of the maximum the maximum of tenderness he meant as the terms existed for him the maximum of immersion in the fact of being married maggie herself was capable maggie herself at this season was exquisitely divinely the maximum such was the impression that positively holding off a little for the practical the tactful consideration it inspired in him a respect for the beauty and sanctity of it almost amounting to awe such was the impression he daily received from her she was her mother oh yes but her mother and something more it becoming thus a new light for him and in such a curious way too that anything more than her mother should prove at this time of day possible he could live over again at almost any quiet moment the long process of his introduction to his present interests an introduction that had depended all on himself like the cheek of the young man who approaches a boss without credentials or picks up an acquaintance makes even a real friend by speaking to a passer in the street his real friend in all the business was to have been his own mind with which nobody had put him in relation he had knocked at the door of that essentially private house and his call in truth had not been immediately answered so that when after waiting and coming back he had at last got in it was twirling his hat as an embarrassed stranger or trying his keys as a thief at night he had gained confidence only with time but when he had taken real possession of the place it had been never again to come away all of which success represented it must be allowed his one principle of pride pride in the mere original spring pride in his money would have been pride in something that had come in comparison so easily the right ground for elation was difficulty mastered and his difficulty thanks to his modesty had been to believe in his facility this was the problem he had worked out to its solution the solution that was now doing more than all else to make his feet settle and his days flush and when he wished to feel good as they said at american city he had but to retrace his immense development that was what the whole thing came back to that the development had not been somebody s else passing falsely accepted too ignobly for his to think how servile he might have been was absolutely to respect himself was in fact as much as he liked to admire himself as free the very finest spring that ever responded to his touch was always there to press the memory of his freedom as dawning upon him like a sunrise all pink and silver during a winter divided between florence rome and naples some three years after his wife s death it was the hushed daybreak of the roman revelation in particular that he could usually best recover with the way that there above all where the princes and popes had been before him his divination of his faculty most went to his head he was a plain american citizen staying at an hotel where sometimes for days together there were twenty others like him but no pope no prince of them all had read a richer meaning he believed into the character of the patron of art he was ashamed of them really if he wasn t afraid and he had on the whole never so climbed to the tip top as in judging over a perusal of hermann grimm where julius ii and leo x were placed by their treatment of michael angelo far below the plain american citizen in the case at least in which this personage happened not to be too plain to be adam verver going to our friend s head moreover some of the results of such comparisons may doubtless be described as having stayed there his freedom to see of which the comparisons were part what could it do but steadily grow and grow it came perhaps even too much to stand to him for all freedom since for example it was as much there as ever at the very time of mrs rance s conspiring against him at fawns with the billiard room and the sunday morning on the occasion round which we have perhaps drawn our circle too wide mrs rance at least controlled practically each other license of the present and the near future the license to pass the hour as he would have found convenient the license to stop remembering for a little that though if proposed to and not only by this aspirant but by any other he wouldn t prove foolish the proof of wisdom was none the less in such a fashion rather cruelly conditioned the license in especial to proceed from his letters to his journals and insulate orientate himself afresh by the sound over his gained interval of the many mouthed monster the exercise of whose lungs he so constantly stimulated mrs rance remained with him till the others came back from church and it was by that time clearer than ever that his ordeal when it should arrive would be really most unpleasant his impression this was the point took somehow the form not so much of her wanting to press home her own advantage as of her building better than she knew that is of her symbolising with virtual unconsciousness his own special deficiency his unfortunate lack of a wife to whom applications could be referred the applications the contingencies with which mrs rance struck him as potentially bristling were not of a sort really to be met by one s self and the possibility of them when his visitor said or as good as said i m restrained you see because of mr rance and also because i m proud and refined but if it wasn t for mr rance and for my refinement and my pride the possibility of them i say turned to a great murmurous rustle of a volume to fill the future a rustle of petticoats of scented many paged letters of voices as to which distinguish themselves as they might from each other it mattered little in what part of the resounding country they had learned to make themselves prevail the assinghams and the miss lutches had taken the walk through the park to the little old church on the property that our friend had often found himself wishing he were able to transport as it stood for its simple sweetness in a glass case to one of his exhibitory halls while maggie had induced her husband not inveterate in such practices to make with her by carriage the somewhat longer pilgrimage to the nearest altar modest though it happened to be of the faith her own as it had been her mother s and as mr verver himself had been loosely willing always to let it be taken for his without the solid ease of which making the stage firm and smooth the drama of her marriage might not have been acted out what at last appeared to have happened however was that the divided parties coming back at the same moment had met outside and then drifted together from empty room to room yet not in mere aimless quest of the pair of companions they had left at home the quest had carried them to the door of the billiard room and their appearance as it opened to admit them determined for adam verver in the oddest way in the world a new and sharp perception it was really remarkable this perception expanded on the spot as a flower one of the strangest might at a breath have suddenly opened the breath for that matter was more than anything else the look in his daughter s eyes the look with which he saw her take in exactly what had occurred in her absence mrs rance s pursuit of him to this remote locality the spirit and the very form perfectly characteristic of his acceptance of the complication the seal set in short unmistakably on one of maggie s anxieties the anxiety it was true would have been even though not imparted separately shared for fanny assingham s face was by the same stroke not at all thickly veiled for him and a queer light of a colour quite to match fairly glittered in the four fine eyes of the miss lutches each of these persons counting out that is the prince and the colonel who didn t care and who didn t even see that the others did knew something or had at any rate had her idea the idea precisely that this was what mrs rance artfully biding her time would do the special shade of apprehension on the part of the miss lutches might indeed have suggested the vision of an energy supremely asserted it was droll in truth if one came to that the position of the miss lutches they had themselves brought they had guilelessly introduced mrs rance strong in the fact of mr rance s having been literally beheld of them and it was now for them positively as if their handful of flowers since mrs rance was a handful had been but the vehicle of a dangerous snake mr verver fairly felt in the air the miss lutches imputation in the intensity of which really his own propriety might have been involved that none the less was but a flicker what made the real difference as i have hinted was his mute passage with maggie his daughter s anxiety alone had depths and it opened out for him the wider that it was altogether new when in their common past when till this moment had she shown a fear however dumbly for his individual life they had had fears together just as they had had joys but all of hers at least had been for what equally concerned them here of a sudden was a question that concerned him alone and the soundless explosion of it somehow marked a date he was on her mind he was even in a manner on her hands as a distinct thing that is from being where he had always been merely deep in her heart and in her life too deep down as it were to be disengaged contrasted or opposed in short objectively presented but time finally had done it their relation was altered he saw again the difference lighted for her this marked it to himself and it wasn t a question simply of a mrs rance the more or the less for maggie too at a stroke almost beneficently their visitor had from being an inconvenience become a sign they had made vacant by their marriage his immediate foreground his personal precinct they being the princess and the prince they had made room in it for others so others had become aware he became aware himself for that matter during the minute maggie stood there before speaking and with the sense moreover of what he saw her see he had the sense of what she saw him this last it may be added would have been his intensest perception had there not the next instant been more for him in fanny assingham her face couldn t keep it from him she had seen on top of everything in her quick way what they both were seeing ix so much mute communication was doubtless all this time marvellous and we may confess to having perhaps read into the scene prematurely a critical character that took longer to develop yet the quiet hour of reunion enjoyed that afternoon by the father and the daughter did really little else than deal with the elements definitely presented to each in the vibration produced by the return of the church goers nothing allusive nothing at all insistent passed between them either before or immediately after luncheon except indeed so far as their failure soon again to meet might be itself an accident charged with reference the hour or two after luncheon and on sundays with especial rigour for one of the domestic reasons of which it belonged to maggie quite multitudinously to take account were habitually spent by the princess with her little boy in whose apartment she either frequently found her father already established or was sooner or later joined by him his visit to his grandson at some hour or other held its place in his day against all interventions and this without counting his grandson s visits to him scarcely less ordered and timed and the odd bits as he called them that they picked up together when they could communions snatched for the most part on the terrace in the gardens or the park while the principino with much pomp and circumstance of perambulator parasol fine lace over veiling and incorruptible female attendance took the air in the private apartments which occupying in the great house the larger part of a wing of their own were not much more easily accessible than if the place had been a royal palace and the small child an heir apparent in the nursery of nurseries the talk at these instituted times was always so prevailingly with or about the master of the scene that other interests and other topics had fairly learned to avoid the slighting and inadequate notice there taken of them they came in at the best but as involved in the little boy s future his past or his comprehensive present never getting so much as a chance to plead their own merits or to complain of being neglected nothing perhaps in truth had done more than this united participation to confirm in the elder parties that sense of a life not only uninterrupted but more deeply associated more largely combined of which on adam verver s behalf we have made some mention it was of course an old story and a familiar idea that a beautiful baby could take its place as a new link between a wife and a husband but maggie and her father had with every ingenuity converted the precious creature into a link between a mamma and a grandpapa the principino for a chance spectator of this process might have become by an untoward stroke a hapless half orphan with the place of immediate male parent swept bare and open to the next nearest sympathy they had no occasion thus the conjoined worshippers to talk of what the prince might be or might do for his son the sum of service in his absence so completely filled itself out it was not in the least moreover that there was doubt of him for he was conspicuously addicted to the manipulation of the child in the frank italian way at such moments as he judged discreet in respect to other claims conspicuously indeed that is for maggie who had more occasion on the whole to speak to her husband of the extravagance of her father than to speak to her father of the extravagance of her husband adam verver had all round in this connection his own serenity he was sure of his son in law s auxiliary admiration admiration he meant of his grand son since to begin with what else had been at work but the instinct or it might fairly have been the tradition of the latter s making the child so solidly beautiful as to have to be admired what contributed most to harmony in this play of relations however was the way the young man seemed to leave it to be gathered that tradition for tradition the grandpapa s own was not in any estimate to go for nothing a tradition or whatever it was that had flowered prelusively in the princess herself well amerigo s very discretions were his way of taking account of it his discriminations in respect to his heir were in fine not more angular than any others to be observed in him and mr verver received perhaps from no source so distinct an impression of being for him an odd and important phenomenon as he received from this impunity of appropriation these unchallenged nursery hours it was as if the grandpapa s special show of the character were but another side for the observer to study another item for him to note it came back this latter personage knew to his own previous perception that of the prince s inability in any matter in which he was concerned to conclude the idiosyncrasy for him at each stage had to be demonstrated on which however he admirably accepted it this last was after all the point he really worked poor young man for acceptance since he worked so constantly for comprehension and how when you came to that could you know that a horse wouldn t shy at a brass band in a country road because it didn t shy at a traction engine it might have been brought up to traction engines without having been brought up to brass bands little by little thus from month to month the prince was learning what his wife s father had been brought up to and now it could be checked off he had been brought up to the romantic view of principini who would have thought it and where would it all stop the only fear somewhat sharp for mr verver was a certain fear of disappointing him for strangeness he felt that the evidence he offered thus viewed was too much on the positive side he didn t know he was learning and it was funny for him to how many things he had been brought up if the prince could only strike something to which he hadn t this wouldn t it seemed to him ruffle the smoothness and yet might a little add to the interest what was now clear at all events for the father and the daughter was their simply knowing they wanted for the time to be together at any cost as it were and their necessity so worked in them as to bear them out of the house in a quarter hidden from that in which their friends were gathered and cause them to wander unseen unfollowed along a covered walk in the old garden as it was called old with an antiquity of formal things high box and shaped yew and expanses of brick wall that had turned at once to purple and to pink they went out of a door in the wall a door that had a slab with a date set above it but in the old multiplied lettering and then had before them a small white gate intensely white and clean amid all the greenness through which they gradually passed to where some of the grandest trees spaciously clustered and where they would find one of the quietest places a bench had been placed long ago beneath a great oak that helped to crown a mild eminence and the ground sank away below it to rise again opposite at a distance sufficient to enclose the solitude and figure a bosky horizon summer blissfully was with them yet and the low sun made a splash of light where it pierced the looser shade maggie coming down to go out had brought a parasol which as over her charming bare head she now handled it gave with the big straw hat that her father in these days always wore a good deal tipped back definite intention to their walk they knew the bench it was sequestered they had praised it for that together before and liked the word and after they had begun to linger there they could have smiled if they hadn t been really too serious and if the question hadn t so soon ceased to matter over the probable wonder of the others as to what would have become of them the extent to which they enjoyed their indifference to any judgment of their want of ceremony what did that of itself speak but for the way that as a rule they almost equally had others on their mind they each knew that both were full of the superstition of not hurting but might precisely have been asking themselves asking in fact each other at this moment whether that was to be after all the last word of their conscientious development certain it was at all events that in addition to the assinghams and the lutches and mrs rance the attendance at tea just in the right place on the west terrace might perfectly comprise the four or five persons among them the very pretty the typically irish miss maddock vaunted announced and now brought from the couple of other houses near enough one of these the minor residence of their proprietor established thriftily while he hired out his ancestral home within sight and sense of his profit it was not less certain either that for once in a way the group in question must all take the case as they found it fanny assingham at any time for that matter might perfectly be trusted to see mr verver and his daughter to see their reputation for a decent friendliness through any momentary danger might be trusted even to carry off their absence for amerigo for amerigo s possible funny italian anxiety amerigo always being as the princess was well aware conveniently amenable to this friend s explanations beguilements reassurances and perhaps in fact rather more than less dependent on them as his new life since that was his own name for it opened out it was no secret to maggie it was indeed positively a public joke for her that she couldn t explain as mrs assingham did and that the prince liking explanations liking them almost as if he collected them in the manner of book plates or postage stamps for themselves his requisition of this luxury had to be met he didn t seem to want them as yet for use rather for ornament and amusement innocent amusement of the kind he most fancied and that was so characteristic of his blessed beautiful general slightly indolent lack of more dissipated or even just of more sophisticated tastes however that might be the dear woman had come to be frankly and gaily recognised and not least by herself as filling in the intimate little circle an office that was not always a sinecure it was almost as if she had taken with her kind melancholy colonel at her heels a responsible engagement to be within call as it were for all those appeals that sprang out of talk that sprang not a little doubtless too out of leisure it naturally led her position in the household as she called it to considerable frequency of presence to visits from the good couple freely repeated and prolonged and not so much as under form of protest she was there to keep him quiet it was amerigo s own description of her influence and it would only have needed a more visible disposition to unrest in him to make the account perfectly fit fanny herself limited indeed she minimised her office you didn t need a jailor she contended for a domesticated lamb tied up with pink ribbon this was not an animal to be controlled it was an animal to be at the most educated she admitted accordingly that she was educative which maggie was so aware that she herself inevitably wasn t so it came round to being true that what she was most in charge of was his mere intelligence this left goodness knew plenty of different calls for maggie to meet in a case in which so much pink ribbon as it might be symbolically named was lavished on the creature what it all amounted to at any rate was that mrs assingham would be keeping him quiet now while his wife and his father in law carried out their own little frugal picnic quite moreover doubtless not much less neededly in respect to the members of the circle that were with them there than in respect to the pair they were missing almost for the first time it was present to maggie that the prince could bear when he was with his wife almost any queerness on the part of people strange english types who bored him beyond convenience by being so little as he himself was for this was one of the ways in which a wife was practically sustaining but she was as positively aware that she hadn t yet learned to see him as meeting such exposure in her absence how did he move and talk how above all did he or how would he look he who with his so nobly handsome face could look such wonderful things in case of being left alone with some of the subjects of his wonder there were subjects for wonder among these very neighbours only maggie herself had her own odd way which didn t moreover the least irritate him of really liking them in proportion as they could strike her as strange it came out in her by heredity he amused himself with declaring this love of chinoiseries but she actually this evening didn t mind he might deal with her chinese as he could maggie indeed would always have had for such moments had they oftener occurred the impression made on her by a word of mrs assingham s a word referring precisely to that appetite in amerigo for the explanatory which we have just found in our path it wasn t that the princess could be indebted to another person even to so clever a one as this friend for seeing anything in her husband that she mightn t see unaided but she had ever hitherto been of a nature to accept with modest gratitude any better description of a felt truth than her little limits terribly marked she knew in the direction of saying the right things enabled her to make thus it was at any rate that she was able to live more or less in the light of the fact expressed so lucidly by their common comforter the fact that the prince was saving up for some very mysterious but very fine eventual purpose all the wisdom all the answers to his questions all the impressions and generalisations he gathered putting them away and packing them down because he wanted his great gun to be loaded to the brim on the day he should decide to let it off he wanted first to make sure of the whole of the subject that was unrolling itself before him after which the innumerable facts he had collected would find their use he knew what he was about trust him at last therefore to make and to some effect his big noise and mrs assingham had repeated that he knew what he was about it was the happy form of this assurance that had remained with maggie it could always come in for her that amerigo knew what he was about he might at moments seem vague seem absent seem even bored this when away from her father with whom it was impossible for him to appear anything but respectfully occupied he let his native gaiety go in outbreaks of song or even of quite whimsical senseless sound either expressive of intimate relaxation or else fantastically plaintive he might at times reflect with the frankest lucidity on the circumstance that the case was for a good while yet absolutely settled in regard to what he still had left at home of his very own in regard to the main seat of his affection the house in rome the big black palace the palazzo nero as he was fond of naming it and also on the question of the villa in the sabine hills which she had at the time of their engagement seen and yearned over and the castello proper described by him always as the perched place that had as she knew formerly stood up on the pedestal of its mountain slope showing beautifully blue from afar as the head and front of the princedom he might rejoice in certain moods over the so long estranged state of these properties not indeed all irreclaimably alienated but encumbered with unending leases and charges with obstinate occupants with impossibilities of use all without counting the cloud of mortgages that had from far back buried them beneath the ashes of rage and remorse a shroud as thick as the layer once resting on the towns at the foot of vesuvius and actually making of any present restorative effort a process much akin to slow excavation just so he might with another turn of his humour almost wail for these brightest spots of his lost paradise declaring that he was an idiot not to be able to bring himself to face the sacrifices sacrifices resting if definitely anywhere with mr verver necessary for winning them back one of the most comfortable things between the husband and the wife meanwhile one of those easy certitudes they could be merely gay about was that she never admired him so much or so found him heartbreakingly handsome clever irresistible in the very degree in which he had originally and fatally dawned upon her as when she saw other women reduced to the same passive pulp that had then begun once for all to constitute her substance there was really nothing they had talked of together with more intimate and familiar pleasantry than of the license and privilege the boundless happy margin thus established for each she going so far as to put it that even should he some day get drunk and beat her the spectacle of him with hated rivals would after no matter what extremity always for the sovereign charm of it charm of it in itself and as the exhibition of him that most deeply moved her suffice to bring her round what would therefore be more open to him than to keep her in love with him he agreed with all his heart at these light moments that his course wouldn t then be difficult inasmuch as so simply constituted as he was on all the precious question and why should he be ashamed of it he knew but one way with the fair they had to be fair and he was fastidious and particular his standard was high but when once this was the case what relation with them was conceivable what relation was decent rudimentary properly human but that of a plain interest in the fairness his interest she always answered happened not to be plain and plainness all round had little to do with the matter which was marked on the contrary by the richest variety of colour but the working basis at all events had been settled the miss maddocks of life been assured of their importance for him how conveniently assured maggie to take him too into the joke had more than once gone so far as to mention to her father since it fell in easily with the tenderness of her disposition to remember she might occasionally make him happy by an intimate confidence this was one of her rules full as she was of little rules considerations provisions there were things she of course couldn t tell him in so many words about amerigo and herself and about their happiness and their union and their deepest depths and there were other things she needn t but there were also those that were both true and amusing both communicable and real and of these with her so conscious so delicately cultivated scheme of conduct as a daughter she could make her profit at will a pleasant hush for that matter had fallen on most of the elements while she lingered apart with her companion it involved this serenity innumerable complete assumptions since so ordered and so splendid a rest all the tokens spreading about them of confidence solidly supported might have suggested for persons of poorer pitch the very insolence of facility still they weren t insolent they weren t our pair could reflect they were only blissful and grateful and personally modest not ashamed of knowing with competence when great things were great when good things were good and when safe things were safe and not therefore placed below their fortune by timidity which would have been as bad as being below it by impudence worthy of it as they were and as each appears under our last possible analysis to have wished to make the other feel that they were what they most finally exhaled into the evening air as their eyes mildly met may well have been a kind of helplessness in their felicity their rightness the justification of everything something they so felt the pulse of sat there with them but they might have been asking themselves a little blankly to what further use they could put anything so perfect they had created and nursed and established it they had housed it here in dignity and crowned it with comfort but mightn t the moment possibly count for them or count at least for us while we watch them with their fate all before them as the dawn of the discovery that it doesn t always meet all contingencies to be right otherwise why should maggie have found a word of definite doubt the expression of the fine pang determined in her a few hours before rise after a time to her lips she took so for granted moreover her companion s intelligence of her doubt that the mere vagueness of her question could say it all what is it after all that they want to do to you they were for the princess too the hovering forces of which mrs rance was the symbol and her father only smiling back now at his ease took no trouble to appear not to know what she meant what she meant when once she had spoken could come out well enough though indeed it was nothing after they had come to the point that could serve as ground for a great defensive campaign the waters of talk spread a little and maggie presently contributed an idea in saying what has really happened is that the proportions for us are altered he accepted equally for the time this somewhat cryptic remark he still failed to challenge her even when she added that it wouldn t so much matter if he hadn t been so terribly young he uttered a sound of protest only when she went to declare that she ought as a daughter in common decency to have waited yet by that time she was already herself admitting that she should have had to wait long if she waited that is till he was old but there was a way since you are an irresistible youth we ve got to face it that somehow is what that woman has made me feel there ll be others x to talk of it thus appeared at last a positive relief to him yes there ll be others but you ll see me through she hesitated do you mean if you give in oh no through my holding out maggie waited again but when she spoke it had an effect of abruptness why should you hold out forever he gave none the less no start and this as from the habit of taking anything taking everything from her as harmonious but it was quite written upon him too for that matter that holding out wouldn t be so very completely his natural or at any rate his acquired form his appearance would have testified that he might have to do so a long time for a man so greatly beset this appearance that is spoke but little as yet of short remainders and simplified senses and all in spite of his being a small spare slightly stale person deprived of the general prerogative of presence it was not by mass or weight or vulgar immediate quantity that he would in the future any more than he had done in the past insist or resist or prevail there was even something in him that made his position on any occasion made his relation to any scene or to any group a matter of the back of the stage of an almost visibly conscious want of affinity with the footlights he would have figured less than anything the stage manager or the author of the play who most occupy the foreground he might be at the best the financial backer watching his interests from the wing but in rather confessed ignorance of the mysteries of mimicry barely taller than his daughter he pressed at no point on the presumed propriety of his greater stoutness he had lost early in life much of his crisp closely curling hair the fineness of which was repeated in a small neat beard too compact to be called full though worn equally as for a mark where other marks were wanting on lip and cheek and chin his neat colourless face provided with the merely indispensable features suggested immediately for a description that it was clear and in this manner somewhat resembled a small decent room clean swept and unencumbered with furniture but drawing a particular advantage as might presently be noted from the outlook of a pair of ample and uncurtained windows there was something in adam verver s eyes that both admitted the morning and the evening in unusual quantities and gave the modest area the outward extension of a view that was big even when restricted to stars deeply and changeably blue though not romantically large they were yet youthfully almost strangely beautiful with their ambiguity of your scarce knowing if they most carried their possessor s vision out or most opened themselves to your own whatever you might feel they stamped the place with their importance as the house agents say so that on one side or the other you were never out of their range were moving about for possible community opportunity the sight of you scarce knew what either before them or behind them if other importances not to extend the question kept themselves down they were in no direction less obtruded than in that of our friend s dress adopted once for all as with a sort of sumptuary scruple he wore every day of the year whatever the occasion the same little black cut away coat of the fashion of his younger time he wore the same cool looking trousers chequered in black and white the proper harmony with which he inveterately considered was a sprigged blue satin necktie and over his concave little stomach quaintly indifferent to climates and seasons a white duck waistcoat should you really he now asked like me to marry he spoke as if coming from his daughter herself it might be an idea which for that matter he would be ready to carry out should she definitely say so definite however just yet she was not prepared to be though it seemed to come to her with force as she thought that there was a truth in the connection to utter what i feel is that there is somehow something that used to be right and that i ve made wrong it used to be right that you hadn t married and that you didn t seem to want to it used also she continued to make out to seem easy for the question not to come up that s what i ve made different it does come up it will come up you don t think i can keep it down mr verver s tone was cheerfully pensive well i ve given you by my move all the trouble of having to he liked the tenderness of her idea and it made him as she sat near him pass his arm about her i guess i don t feel as if you had moved very far you ve only moved next door well she continued i don t feel as if it were fair for me just to have given you a push and left you so if i ve made the difference for you i must think of the difference then what darling he indulgently asked do you think that s just what i don t yet know but i must find out we must think together as we ve always thought what i mean she went on after a moment is that it strikes me that i ought to at least offer you some alternative i ought to have worked one out for you an alternative to what well to your simply missing what you ve lost without anything being done about it but what have i lost she thought a minute as if it were difficult to say yet as if she more and more saw it well whatever it was that before kept us from thinking and kept you really as you might say in the market it was as if you couldn t be in the market when you were married to me or rather as if i kept people off innocently by being married to you now that i m married to some one else you re as in consequence married to nobody therefore you may be married to anybody to everybody people don t see why you shouldn t be married to them isn t it enough of a reason he mildly inquired that i don t want to be it s enough of a reason yes but to be enough of a reason it has to be too much of a trouble i mean for you it has to be too much of a fight you ask me what you ve lost maggie continued to explain the not having to take the trouble and to make the fight that s what you ve lost the advantage the happiness of being just as you were because i was just as i was that s what you miss so that you think her father presently said that i had better get married just in order to be as i was before the detached tone of it detached as if innocently to amuse her by showing his desire to accommodate was so far successful as to draw from her gravity a short light laugh well what i don t want you to feel is that if you were to i shouldn t understand i should understand that s all said the princess gently her companion turned it pleasantly over you don t go so far as to wish me to take somebody i don t like ah father she sighed you know how far i go how far i could go but i only wish that if you ever should like anybody you may never doubt of my feeling how i ve brought you to it you ll always know that i know that it s my fault you mean he went on in his contemplative way that it will be you who ll take the consequences maggie just considered i ll leave you all the good ones but i ll take the bad well that s handsome he emphasised his sense of it by drawing her closer and holding her more tenderly it s about all i could expect of you so far as you ve wronged me therefore we ll call it square i ll let you know in time if i see a prospect of your having to take it up but am i to understand meanwhile he soon went on that ready as you are to see me through my collapse you re not ready or not as ready to see me through my resistance i ve got to be a regular martyr before you ll be inspired she demurred at his way of putting it why if you like it you know it won t be a collapse then why talk about seeing me through at all i shall only collapse if i do like it but what i seem to feel is that i don t want to like it that is he amended unless i feel surer i do than appears very probable i don t want to have to think i like it in a case when i really shan t i ve had to do that in some cases he confessed when it has been a question of other things i don t want he wound up to be made to make a mistake ah but it s too dreadful she returned that you should even have to fear or just nervously to dream that you may be what does that show after all she asked but that you do really well within feel a want what does it show but that you re truly susceptible well it may show that he defended himself against nothing but it shows also i think that charming women are in the kind of life we re leading now numerous and formidable maggie entertained for a moment the proposition under cover of which however she passed quickly from the general to the particular do you feel mrs rance to be charming well i feel her to be formidable when they cast a spell it comes to the same thing i think she d do anything oh well i d help you the princess said with decision as against her if that s all you require it s too funny she went on before he again spoke that mrs rance should be here at all but if you talk of the life we lead much of it is altogether i m bound to say too funny the thing is maggie developed under this impression that i don t think we lead as regards other people any life at all we don t at any rate it seems to me lead half the life we might and so it seems i think to amerigo so it seems also i m sure to fanny assingham mr verver as if from due regard for these persons considered a little what life would they like us to lead oh it s not a question i think on which they quite feel together she thinks dear fanny that we ought to be greater greater he echoed it vaguely and amerigo too you say ah yes her reply was prompt but amerigo doesn t mind he doesn t care i mean what we do it s for us he considers to see things exactly as we wish fanny herself maggie pursued thinks he s magnificent magnificent i mean for taking everything as it is for accepting the social limitations of our life for not missing what we don t give him mr verver attended then if he doesn t miss it his magnificence is easy it is easy that s exactly what i think if there were things he did miss and if in spite of them he were always sweet then no doubt he would be a more or less unappreciated hero he could be a hero he will be one if it s ever necessary but it will be about something better than our dreariness i know the princess declared where he s magnificent and she rested a minute on that she ended however as she had begun we re not all the same committed to anything stupid if we ought to be grander as fanny thinks we can be grander there s nothing to prevent is it a strict moral obligation adam verver inquired no it s for the amusement for whose for fanny s own for everyone s though i dare say fanny s would be a large part she hesitated she had now it might have appeared something more to bring out which she finally produced for yours in particular say if you go into the question she even bravely followed it up i haven t really after all had to think much to see that much more can be done for you than is done mr verver uttered an odd vague sound don t you think a good deal is done when you come out and talk to me this way ah said his daughter smiling at him we make too much of that and then to explain that s good and it s natural but it isn t great we forget that we re as free as air well that s great mr verver pleaded great if we act on it not if we don t she continued to smile and he took her smile wondering again a little by this time however struck more and more by an intensity in it that belied a light tone what do you want he demanded to do to me and he added as she didn t say you ve got something in your mind it had come to him within the minute that from the beginning of their session there she had been keeping something back and that an impression of this had more than once in spite of his general theoretic respect for her present right to personal reserves and mysteries almost ceased to be vague in him there had been from the first something in her anxious eyes in the way she occasionally lost herself that it would perfectly explain he was therefore now quite sure you ve got something up your sleeve she had a silence that made him right well when i tell you you ll understand it s only up my sleeve in the sense of being in a letter i got this morning all day yes it has been in my mind i ve been asking myself if it were quite the right moment or in any way fair to ask you if you could stand just now another woman it relieved him a little yet the beautiful consideration of her manner made it in a degree portentous stand one well mind her coming he stared then he laughed it depends on who she is there you see i ve at all events been thinking whether you d take this particular person but as a worry the more whether that is you d go so far with her in your notion of having to be kind he gave at this the quickest shake to his foot how far would she go in her notion of it well his daughter returned you know how far in a general way charlotte stant goes charlotte is she coming she writes me practically that she d like to if we re so good as to ask her mr verver continued to gaze but rather as if waiting for more then as everything appeared to have come his expression had a drop if this was all it was simple then why in the world not maggie s face lighted anew but it was now another light it isn t a want of tact to ask her to propose it to you that i should ask her he put the question as an effect of his remnant of vagueness but this had also its own effect maggie wondered an instant after which as with a flush of recognition she took it up it would be too beautiful if you would this clearly had not been her first idea the chance of his words had prompted it do you mean write to her myself yes it would be kind it would be quite beautiful of you that is of course said maggie if you sincerely can he appeared to wonder an instant why he sincerely shouldn t and indeed for that matter where the question of sincerity came in this virtue between him and his daughter s friend had surely been taken for granted my dear child he returned i don t think i m afraid of charlotte well that s just what it s lovely to have from you from the moment you re not the least little bit i ll immediately invite her but where in the world is she he spoke as if he had not thought of charlotte nor so much as heard her name pronounced for a very long time he quite in fact amicably almost amusedly woke up to her she s in brittany at a little bathing place with some people i don t know she s always with people poor dear she rather has to be even when as is sometimes the case they re people she doesn t immensely like well i guess she likes us said adam verver yes fortunately she likes us and if i wasn t afraid of spoiling it for you maggie added i d even mention that you re not the one of our number she likes least why should that spoil it for me oh my dear you know what else have we been talking about it costs you so much to be liked that s why i hesitated to tell you of my letter he stared a moment as if the subject had suddenly grown out of recognition but charlotte on other visits never used to cost me anything no only her keep maggie smiled then i don t think i mind her keep if that s all the princess however it was clear wished to be thoroughly conscientious well it may not be quite all if i think of its being pleasant to have her it s because she will make a difference well what s the harm in that if it s but a difference for the better ah then there you are and the princess showed in her smile her small triumphant wisdom if you acknowledge a possible difference for the better we re not after all so tremendously right as we are i mean we re not as satisfied and amused we do see there are ways of being grander but will charlotte stant her father asked with surprise make us grander maggie on this looking at him well had a remarkable reply yes i think really grander he thought for if this was a sudden opening he wished but the more to meet it because she s so handsome no father and the princess was almost solemn because she s so great great great in nature in character in spirit great in life so mr verver echoed what has she done in life well she has been brave and bright said maggie that mayn t sound like much but she has been so in the face of things that might well have made it too difficult for many other girls she hasn t a creature in the world really that is nearly belonging to her only acquaintances who in all sorts of ways make use of her and distant relations who are so afraid she ll make use of them that they seldom let her look at them mr verver was struck and as usual to some purpose if we get her here to improve us don t we too then make use of her it pulled the princess up however but an instant we re old old friends we do her good too i should always even at the worst speaking for myself admire her still more than i used her i see that always does good maggie hesitated certainly she knows it she knows i mean how great i think her courage and her cleverness she s not afraid not of anything and yet she no more ever takes a liberty with you than if she trembled for her life and then she s interesting which plenty of other people with plenty of other merits never are a bit in which fine flicker of vision the truth widened to the princess s view i myself of course don t take liberties but then i do always by nature tremble for my life that s the way i live oh i say love her father vaguely murmured yes i live in terror she insisted i m a small creeping thing you ll not persuade me that you re not as good as charlotte stant he still placidly enough remarked i may be as good but i m not so great and that s what we re talking about she has a great imagination she has in every way a great attitude she has above all a great conscience more perhaps than ever in her life before maggie addressed her father at this moment with a shade of the absolute in her tone she had never come so near telling him what he should take it from her to believe she has only twopence in the world but that has nothing to do with it or rather indeed she quickly corrected herself it has everything for she doesn t care i never saw her do anything but laugh at her poverty her life has been harder than anyone knows it was moreover as if thus unprecedentedly positive his child had an effect upon him that mr verver really felt as a new thing why then haven t you told me about her before well haven t we always known i should have thought he submitted that we had already pretty well sized her up certainly we long ago quite took her for granted but things change with time and i seem to know that after this interval i m going to like her better than ever i ve lived more myself i m older and one judges better yes i m going to see in charlotte said the princess and speaking now as with high and free expectation more than i ve ever seen then i ll try to do so too she was it came back to mr verver more the one of your friends i thought the best for you his companion however was so launched in her permitted liberty of appreciation that she for the moment scarce heard him she was lost in the case she made out the vision of the different ways in which charlotte had distinguished herself she would have liked for instance i m sure she would have liked extremely to marry and nothing in general is more ridiculous even when it has been pathetic than a woman who has tried and has not been able it had all mr verver s attention she has tried she has seen cases where she would have liked to but she has not been able well there are more cases in europe in which it doesn t come to girls who are poor than in which it does come to them especially said maggie with her continued competence when they re americans well her father now met her and met her cheerfully on all sides unless you mean he suggested that when the girls are american there are more cases in which it comes to the rich than to the poor she looked at him good humouredly that may be but i m not going to be smothered in my case it ought to make me if i were in danger of being a fool all the nicer to people like charlotte it s not hard for me she practically explained not to be ridiculous unless in a very different way i might easily be ridiculous i suppose by behaving as if i thought i had done a great thing charlotte at any rate has done nothing and anyone can see it and see also that it s rather strange and yet no one no one not awfully presumptuous or offensive would like or would dare to treat her just as she is as anything but quite right that s what it is to have something about you that carries things off mr verver s silence on this could only be a sign that she had caused her story to interest him though the sign when he spoke was perhaps even sharper and is it also what you mean by charlotte s being great well said maggie it s one of her ways but she has many again for a little her father considered and who is it she has tried to marry maggie on her side as well waited as if to bring it out with effect but she after a minute either renounced or encountered an obstacle i m afraid i m not sure then how do you know well i don t know and qualifying again she was earnestly emphatic i only make it out for myself but you must make it out about someone in particular she had another pause i don t think i want even for myself to put names and times to pull away any veil i ve an idea there has been more than once somebody i m not acquainted with and needn t be or want to be in any case it s all over and beyond giving her credit for everything it s none of my business mr verver deferred yet he discriminated i don t see how you can give credit without knowing the facts can t i give it generally for dignity dignity i mean in misfortune you ve got to postulate the misfortune first well said maggie i can do that isn t it always a misfortune to be when you re so fine so wasted and yet she went on not to wail about it not to look even as if you knew it mr verver seemed at first to face this as a large question and then after a little solicited by another view to let the appeal drop well she mustn t be wasted we won t at least have waste it produced in maggie s face another gratitude then dear sir that s all i want and it would apparently have settled their question and ended their talk if her father had not after a little shown the disposition to revert how many times are you supposing that she has tried once more at this and as if she hadn t been couldn t be hated to be in such delicate matters literal she was moved to attenuate oh i don t say she absolutely ever tried he looked perplexed but if she has so absolutely failed what then had she done she has suffered she has done that and the princess added she has loved and she has lost mr verver however still wondered but how many times maggie hesitated but it cleared up once is enough enough that is for one to be kind to her her father listened yet not challenging only as with a need of some basis on which under these new lights his bounty could be firm but has she told you nothing ah thank goodness no he stared then don t young women tell because you mean it s just what they re supposed to do she looked at him flushed again now with which after another hesitation do young men tell she asked he gave a short laugh how do i know my dear what young men do then how do i know father what vulgar girls do i see i see he quickly returned but she spoke the next moment as if she might odiously have been sharp what happens at least is that where there s a great deal of pride there s a great deal of silence i don t know i admit what i should do if i were lonely and sore for what sorrow to speak of have i ever had in my life i don t know even if i m proud it seems to me the question has never come up for me oh i guess you re proud mag her father cheerfully interposed i mean i guess you re proud enough well then i hope i m humble enough too i might at all events for all i know be abject under a blow how can i tell do you realise father that i ve never had the least blow he gave her a long quiet look who should realise if i don t well you ll realise when i have one she exclaimed with a short laugh that resembled as for good reasons his own of a minute before i wouldn t in any case have let her tell me what would have been dreadful to me for such wounds and shames are dreadful at least she added catching herself up i suppose they are for what as i say do i know of them i don t want to know she spoke quite with vehemence there are things that are sacred whether they re joys or pains but one can always for safety be kind she kept on one feels when that s right she had got up with these last words she stood there before him with that particular suggestion in her aspect to which even the long habit of their life together had not closed his sense kept sharp year after year by the collation of types and signs the comparison of fine object with fine object of one degree of finish of one form of the exquisite with another the appearance of some slight slim draped antique of vatican or capitoline halls late and refined rare as a note and immortal as a link set in motion by the miraculous infusion of a modern impulse and yet for all the sudden freedom of folds and footsteps forsaken after centuries by their pedestal keeping still the quality the perfect felicity of the statue the blurred absent eyes the smoothed elegant nameless head the impersonal flit of a creature lost in an alien age and passing as an image in worn relief round and round a precious vase she had always had odd moments of striking him daughter of his very own though she was as a figure thus simplified generalised in its grace a figure with which his human connection was fairly interrupted by some vague analogy of turn and attitude something shyly mythological and nymphlike the trick he was not uncomplacently aware was mainly of his own mind it came from his caring for precious vases only less than for precious daughters and what was more to the point still it often operated while he was quite at the same time conscious that maggie had been described even in her prettiness as prim mrs rance herself had enthusiastically used the word of her while he remembered that when once she had been told before him familiarly that she resembled a nun she had replied that she was delighted to hear it and would certainly try to while also finally it was present to him that discreetly heedless thanks to her long association with nobleness in art to the leaps and bounds of fashion she brought her hair down very straight and flat over her temples in the constant manner of her mother who had not been a bit mythological nymphs and nuns were certainly separate types but mr verver when he really amused himself let consistency go the play of vision was at all events so rooted in him that he could receive impressions of sense even while positively thinking he was positively thinking while maggie stood there and it led for him to yet another question which in its turn led to others still do you regard the condition as hers then that you spoke of a minute ago the condition why that of having loved so intensely that she s as you say beyond everything maggie had scarcely to reflect her answer was so prompt oh no she s beyond nothing for she has had nothing i see you must have had things to be them it s a kind of law of perspective maggie didn t know about the law but she continued definite she s not for example beyond help oh well then she shall have all we can give her i ll write to her he said with pleasure angel she answered as she gaily and tenderly looked at him true as this might be however there was one thing more he was an angel with a human curiosity has she told you she likes me much certainly she has told me but i won t pamper you let it be enough for you it has always been one of my reasons for liking her then she s indeed not beyond everything mr verver more or less humorously observed oh it isn t thank goodness that she s in love with you it s not as i told you at first the sort of thing for you to fear he had spoken with cheer but it appeared to drop before this reassurance as if the latter overdid his alarm and that should be corrected oh my dear i ve always thought of her as a little girl ah she s not a little girl said the princess then i ll write to her as a brilliant woman it s exactly what she is mr verver had got up as he spoke and for a little before retracing their steps they stood looking at each other as if they had really arranged something they had come out together for themselves but it had produced something more what it had produced was in fact expressed by the words with which he met his companion s last emphasis well she has a famous friend in you princess maggie took this in it was too plain for a protest do you know what i m really thinking of she asked he wondered with her eyes on him eyes of contentment at her freedom now to talk and he wasn t such a fool he presently showed as not suddenly to arrive at it why of your finding her at last yourself a husband good for you maggie smiled but it will take she added some looking then let me look right here with you her father said as they walked on xi mrs assingham and the colonel quitting fawns before the end of september had come back later on and now a couple of weeks after they were again interrupting their stay but this time with the question of their return left to depend on matters that were rather hinted at than importunately named the lutches and mrs rance had also by the action of charlotte stant s arrival ceased to linger though with hopes and theories as to some promptitude of renewal of which the lively expression awakening the echoes of the great stone paved oak panelled galleried hall that was not the least interesting feature of the place seemed still a property of the air it was on this admirable spot that before her october afternoon had waned fanny assingham spent with her easy host a few moments which led to her announcing her own and her husband s final secession at the same time as they tempted her to point the moral of all vain reverberations the double door of the house stood open to an effect of hazy autumn sunshine a wonderful windless waiting golden hour under the influence of which adam verver met his genial friend as she came to drop into the post box with her own hand a thick sheaf of letters they presently thereafter left the house together and drew out half an hour on the terrace in a manner they were to revert to in thought later on as that of persons who really had been taking leave of each other at a parting of the ways he traced his impression on coming to consider back to a mere three words she had begun by using about charlotte stant she simply cleared them out those had been the three words thrown off in reference to the general golden peace that the kentish october had gradually ushered in the halcyon days the full beauty of which had appeared to shine out for them after charlotte s arrival for it was during these days that mrs rance and the miss lutches had been observed to be gathering themselves for departure and it was with that difference made that the sense of the whole situation showed most fair the sense of how right they had been to engage for so ample a residence and of all the pleasure so fruity an autumn there could hold in its lap this was what had occurred that their lesson had been learned and what mrs assingham had dwelt upon was that without charlotte it would have been learned but half it would certainly not have been taught by mrs rance and the miss lutches if these ladies had remained with them as long as at one time seemed probable charlotte s light intervention had thus become a cause operating covertly but none the less actively and fanny assingham s speech which she had followed up a little echoed within him fairly to startle him as the indication of something irresistible he could see now how this superior force had worked and he fairly liked to recover the sight little harm as he dreamed of doing little ill as he dreamed of wishing the three ladies whom he had after all entertained for a stiffish series of days she had been so vague and quiet about it wonderful charlotte that he hadn t known what was happening happening that is as a result of her influence their fires as they felt her turned to smoke mrs assingham remarked which he was to reflect on indeed even while they strolled he had retained since his long talk with maggie the talk that had settled the matter of his own direct invitation to her friend an odd little taste as he would have described it for hearing things said about this young woman hearing so to speak what could be said about her almost as it her portrait by some eminent hand were going on so that he watched it grow under the multiplication of touches mrs assingham it struck him applied two or three of the finest in their discussion of their young friend so different a figure now from that early playmate of maggie s as to whom he could almost recall from of old the definite occasions of his having paternally lumped the two children together in the recommendation that they shouldn t make too much noise nor eat too much jam his companion professed that in the light of charlotte s prompt influence she had not been a stranger to a pang of pity for their recent visitors i felt in fact privately so sorry for them that i kept my impression to myself while they were here wishing not to put the rest of you on the scent neither maggie nor the prince nor yourself nor even charlotte herself if you didn t happen to notice since you didn t apparently i perhaps now strike you as extravagant but i m not i followed it all one saw the consciousness i speak of come over the poor things very much as i suppose people at the court of the borgias may have watched each other begin to look queer after having had the honour of taking wine with the heads of the family my comparison s only a little awkward for i don t in the least mean that charlotte was consciously dropping poison into their cup she was just herself their poison in the sense of mortally disagreeing with them but she didn t know it ah she didn t know it mr verver had asked with interest well i think she didn t mrs assingham had to admit that she hadn t pressingly sounded her i don t pretend to be sure in every connection of what charlotte knows she doesn t certainly like to make people suffer not in general as is the case with so many of us even other women she likes much rather to put them at their ease with her she likes that is as all pleasant people do to be liked ah she likes to be liked her companion had gone on she did at the same time no doubt want to help us to put us at our ease that is she wanted to put you and to put maggie about you so far as that went she had a plan but it was only after it was not before i really believe that she saw how effectively she could work again as mr verver felt he must have taken it up ah she wanted to help us wanted to help me why mrs assingham asked after an instant should it surprise you he just thought oh it doesn t she saw of course as soon as she came with her quickness where we all were she didn t need each of us to go by appointment to her room at night or take her out into the fields for our palpitating tale no doubt even she was rather impatient of the poor things mr verver had here inquired while he waited well of your not yourselves being so and of your not in particular i haven t the least doubt in the world par exemple that she thinks you too meek oh she thinks me too meek and she had been sent for on the very face of it to work right in all she had to do after all was to be nice to you to a me said adam verver he could remember now that his friend had positively had a laugh for his tone to you and to every one she had only to be what she is and to be it all round if she s charming how can she help it so it was and so only that she acted as the borgia wine used to act one saw it come over them the extent to which in her particular way a woman a woman other and so other than themselves could be charming one saw them understand and exchange looks then one saw them lose heart and decide to move for what they had to take home was that it s she who s the real thing ah it s she who s the real thing as he had not hitherto taken it home as completely as the miss lutches and mrs rance so doubtless he had now a little appeared to offer submission in his appeal i see i see he could at least simply take it home now yet as not without wanting at the same time to be sure of what the real thing was and what would it be a definitely that you understand by that she had only for an instant not found it easy to say why exactly what those women themselves want to be and what her effect on them is to make them recognise that they never will oh of course never it not only remained and abode with them it positively developed and deepened after this talk that the luxurious side of his personal existence was now again furnished socially speaking with the thing classed and stamped as real just as he had been able to think of it as not otherwise enriched in consequence of his daughter s marriage the note of reality in so much projected light continued to have for him the charm and the importance of which the maximum had occasionally been reached in his great finds continued beyond any other to keep him attentive and gratified nothing perhaps might affect us as queerer had we time to look into it than this application of the same measure of value to such different pieces of property as old persian carpets say and new human acquisitions all the more indeed that the amiable man was not without an inkling on his own side that he was as a taster of life economically constructed he put into his one little glass everything he raised to his lips and it was as if he had always carried in his pocket like a tool of his trade this receptacle a little glass cut with a fineness of which the art had long since been lost and kept in an old morocco case stamped in uneffaceable gilt with the arms of a deposed dynasty as it had served him to satisfy himself so to speak both about amerigo and about the bernadino luini he had happened to come to knowledge of at the time he was consenting to the announcement of his daughter s betrothal so it served him at present to satisfy himself about charlotte stant and an extraordinary set of oriental tiles of which he had lately got wind to which a provoking legend was attached and as to which he had made out contentedly that further news was to be obtained from a certain mr gutermann seuss of brighton it was all at bottom in him the aesthetic principle planted where it could burn with a cold still flame where it fed almost wholly on the material directly involved on the idea followed by appropriation of plastic beauty of the thing visibly perfect in its kind where in short in spite of the general tendency of the devouring element to spread the rest of his spiritual furniture modest scattered and tended with unconscious care escaped the consumption that in so many cases proceeds from the undue keeping up of profane altar fires adam verver had in other words learnt the lesson of the senses to the end of his own little book without having for a day raised the smallest scandal in his economy at large being in this particular not unlike those fortunate bachelors or other gentlemen of pleasure who so manage their entertainment of compromising company that even the austerest housekeeper occupied and competent below stairs never feels obliged to give warning that figure has however a freedom that the occasion doubtless scarce demands though we may retain it for its rough negative value it was to come to pass by a pressure applied to the situation wholly from within that before the first ten days of november had elapsed he found himself practically alone at fawns with his young friend amerigo and maggie having with a certain abruptness invited his assent to their going abroad for a month since his amusement was now scarce less happily assured than his security an impulse eminently natural had stirred within the prince his life as for some time established was deliciously dull and thereby on the whole what he best liked but a small gust of yearning had swept over him and maggie repeated to her father with infinite admiration the pretty terms in which after it had lasted a little he had described to her this experience he called it a serenade a low music that outside one of the windows of the sleeping house disturbed his rest at night timid as it was and plaintive he yet couldn t close his eyes for it and when finally rising on tiptoe he had looked out he had recognised in the figure below with a mandolin all duskily draped in her grace the raised appealing eyes and the one irresistible voice of the ever to be loved italy sooner or later that way one had to listen it was a hovering haunting ghost as of a creature to whom one had done a wrong a dim pathetic shade crying out to be comforted for this there was obviously but one way as there were doubtless also many words for the simple fact that so prime a roman had a fancy for again seeing rome they would accordingly hadn t they better go for a little maggie meanwhile making the too absurdly artful point with her father so that he repeated it in his amusement to charlotte stant to whom he was by this time conscious of addressing many remarks that it was absolutely when she came to think the first thing amerigo had ever asked of her she doesn t count of course his having asked of her to marry him this was mr verver s indulgent criticism but he found charlotte equally touched by the ingenuous maggie in easy agreement with him over the question if the prince had asked something of his wife every day in the year this would be still no reason why the poor dear man should not in a beautiful fit of homesickness revisit without reproach his native country what his father in law frankly counselled was that the reasonable the really too reasonable pair should while they were about it take three or four weeks of paris as well paris being always for mr verver in any stress of sympathy a suggestion that rose of itself to the lips if they would only do that on their way back or however they preferred it charlotte and he would go over to join them there for a small look though even then assuredly as he had it at heart to add not in the least because they should have found themselves bored at being left together the fate of this last proposal indeed was that it reeled for the moment under an assault of destructive analysis from maggie who having as she granted to choose between being an unnatural daughter or an unnatural mother and electing for the former wanted to know what would become of the principino if the house were cleared of everyone but the servants her question had fairly resounded but it had afterwards like many of her questions dropped still more effectively than it had risen the highest moral of the matter being before the couple took their departure that mrs noble and dr brady must mount unchallenged guard over the august little crib if she hadn t supremely believed in the majestic value of the nurse whose experience was in itself the amplest of pillows just as her attention was a spreading canopy from which precedent and reminiscence dropped as thickly as parted curtains if she hadn t been able to rest in this confidence she would fairly have sent her husband on his journey without her in the same manner if the sweetest for it was so she qualified him of little country doctors hadn t proved to her his wisdom by rendering irresistible especially on rainy days and in direct proportion to the frequency of his calls adapted to all weathers that she should converse with him for hours over causes and consequences over what he had found to answer with his little five at home she would have drawn scant support from the presence of a mere grandfather and a mere brilliant friend these persons accordingly her own predominance having thus for the time given way could carry with a certain ease and above all with mutual aid their consciousness of a charge so far as their office weighed they could help each other with it which was in fact to become as mrs noble herself loomed larger for them not a little of a relief and a diversion mr verver met his young friend at certain hours in the day nursery very much as he had regularly met the child s fond mother charlotte having as she clearly considered given maggie equal pledges and desiring never to fail of the last word for the daily letter she had promised to write she wrote with high fidelity she let her companion know and the effect of it was remarkably enough that he himself didn t write the reason of this was partly that charlotte told all about him which she also let him know she did and partly that he enjoyed feeling as a consequence that he was generally quite systematically eased and as they said done for committed as it were to this charming and clever young woman who by becoming for him a domestic resource had become for him practically a new person and committed especially in his own house which somehow made his sense of it a deeper thing he took an interest in seeing how far the connection could carry him could perhaps even lead him and in thus putting to the test for pleasant verification what fanny assingham had said at the last about the difference such a girl could make she was really making one now in their simplified existence and a very considerable one though there was no one to compare her with as there had been so usefully for fanny no mrs rance no kitty no dotty lutch to help her to be felt according to fanny s diagnosis as real she was real decidedly from other causes and mr verver grew in time even a little amused at the amount of machinery mrs assingham had seemed to see needed for pointing it she was directly and immediately real real on a pleasantly reduced and intimate scale and at no moments more so than during those at which we have just glanced when mrs noble made them both together feel that she she alone in the absence of the queen mother was regent of the realm and governess of the heir treated on such occasions as at best a pair of dangling and merely nominal court functionaries picturesque hereditary triflers entitled to the petites entrees but quite external to the state which began and ended with the nursery they could only retire in quickened sociability to what was left them of the palace there to digest their gilded insignificance and cultivate in regard to the true executive such snuff taking ironies as might belong to rococo chamberlains moving among china lap dogs every evening after dinner charlotte stant played to him seated at the piano and requiring no music she went through his favourite things and he had many favourites with a facility that never failed or that failed but just enough to pick itself up at a touch from his fitful voice she could play anything she could play everything always shockingly she of course insisted but always by his own vague measure very much as if she might slim sinuous and strong and with practised passion have been playing lawn tennis or endlessly and rhythmically waltzing his love of music unlike his other loves owned to vaguenesses but while on his comparatively shaded sofa and smoking smoking always smoking in the great fawns drawing room as everywhere the cigars of his youth rank with associations while i say he so listened to charlotte s piano where the score was ever absent but between the lighted candles the picture distinct the vagueness spread itself about him like some boundless carpet a surface delightfully soft to the pressure of his interest it was a manner of passing the time that rather replaced conversation but the air at the end none the less before they separated had a way of seeming full of the echoes of talk they separated in the hushed house not quite easily yet not quite awkwardly either with tapers that twinkled in the large dark spaces and for the most part so late that the last solemn servant had been dismissed for the night late as it was on a particular evening toward the end of october there had been a full word or two dropped into the still stirring sea of other voices a word or two that affected our friend even at the moment and rather oddly as louder and rounder than any previous sound and then he had lingered under pretext of an opened window to be made secure after taking leave of his companion in the hall and watching her glimmer away up the staircase he had for himself another impulse than to go to bed picking up a hat in the hall slipping his arms into a sleeveless cape and lighting still another cigar he turned out upon the terrace through one of the long drawing room windows and moved to and fro there for an hour beneath the sharp autumn stars it was where he had walked in the afternoon sun with fanny assingham and the sense of that other hour the sense of the suggestive woman herself was before him again as in spite of all the previous degustation we have hinted at it had not yet been he thought in a loose an almost agitated order of many things the power that was in them to agitate having been part of his conviction that he should not soon sleep he truly felt for a while that he should never sleep again till something had come to him some light some idea some mere happy word perhaps that he had begun to want but had been till now and especially the last day or two vainly groping for can you really then come if we start early that was practically all he had said to the girl as she took up her bedroom light and why in the world not when i ve nothing else to do and should besides so immensely like it this had as definitely been on her side the limit of the little scene there had in fact been nothing to call a scene even of the littlest at all though he perhaps didn t quite know why something like the menace of one hadn t proceeded from her stopping half way upstairs to turn and say as she looked down on him that she promised to content herself for their journey with a toothbrush and a sponge there hovered about him at all events while he walked appearances already familiar as well as two or three that were new and not the least vivid of the former connected itself with that sense of being treated with consideration which had become for him as we have noted one of the minor yet so far as there were any such quite one of the compensatory incidents of being a father in law it had struck him up to now that this particular balm was a mixture of which amerigo as through some hereditary privilege alone possessed the secret so that he found himself wondering if it had come to charlotte who had unmistakably acquired it through the young man s having amiably passed it on she made use for her so quietly grateful host however this might be of quite the same shades of attention and recognition was mistress in an equal degree of the regulated the developed art of placing him high in the scale of importance that was even for his own thought a clumsy way of expressing the element of similarity in the agreeable effect they each produced on him and it held him for a little only because this coincidence in their felicity caused him vaguely to connect or associate them in the matter of tradition training tact or whatever else one might call it it might almost have been if such a link between them was to be imagined that amerigo had a little coached or incited their young friend or perhaps rather that she had simply as one of the signs of the general perfection fanny assingham commended in her profited by observing during her short opportunity before the start of the travellers the pleasant application by the prince of his personal system he might wonder what exactly it was that they so resembled each other in treating him like from what noble and propagated convention in cases in which the exquisite importance was to be neither too grossly attributed nor too grossly denied they had taken their specific lesson but the difficulty was here of course that one could really never know couldn t know without having been one s self a personage whether a pope a king a president a peer a general or just a beautiful author before such a question as before several others when they recurred he would come to a pause leaning his arms on the old parapet and losing himself in a far excursion he had as to so many of the matters in hand a divided view and this was exactly what made him reach out in his unrest for some idea lurking in the vast freshness of the night at the breath of which disparities would submit to fusion and so spreading beneath him make him feel that he floated what he kept finding himself return to disturbingly enough was the reflection deeper than anything else that in forming a new and intimate tie he should in a manner abandon or at the best signally relegate his daughter he should reduce to definite form the idea that he had lost her as was indeed inevitable by her own marriage he should reduce to definite form the idea of his having incurred an injury or at the best an inconvenience that required some makeweight and deserved some amends and he should do this the more which was the great point that he should appear to adopt in doing it the sentiment in fact the very conviction entertained and quite sufficiently expressed by maggie herself in her beautiful generosity as to what he had suffered putting it with extravagance at her hands if she put it with extravagance the extravagance was yet sincere for it came which she put with extravagance too from her persistence always in thinking feeling talking about him as young he had had glimpses of moments when to hear her thus in her absolutely unforced compunction one would have supposed the special edge of the wrong she had done him to consist in his having still before him years and years to groan under it she had sacrificed a parent the pearl of parents no older than herself it wouldn t so much have mattered if he had been of common parental age that he wasn t that he was just her extraordinary equal and contemporary this was what added to her act the long train of its effect light broke for him at last indeed quite as a consequence of the fear of breathing a chill upon this luxuriance of her spiritual garden as at a turn of his labyrinth he saw his issue which opened out so wide for the minute that he held his breath with wonder he was afterwards to recall how just then the autumn night seemed to clear to a view in which the whole place everything round him the wide terrace where he stood the others with their steps below the gardens the park the lake the circling woods lay there as under some strange midnight sun it all met him during these instants as a vast expanse of discovery a world that looked so lighted extraordinarily new and in which familiar objects had taken on a distinctness that as if it had been a loud a spoken pretension to beauty interest importance to he scarce knew what gave them an inordinate quantity of character and verily an inordinate size this hallucination or whatever he might have called it was brief but it lasted long enough to leave him gasping the gasp of admiration had by this time however lost itself in an intensity that quickly followed the way the wonder of it since wonder was in question truly had been the strange delay of his vision he had these several days groped and groped for an object that lay at his feet and as to which his blindness came from his stupidly looking beyond it had sat all the while at his hearth stone whence it now gazed up in his face once he had recognised it there everything became coherent the sharp point to which all his light converged was that the whole call of his future to him as a father would be in his so managing that maggie would less and less appear to herself to have forsaken him and it not only wouldn t be decently humane decently possible not to make this relief easy to her the idea shone upon him more than that as exciting inspiring uplifting it fell in so beautifully with what might be otherwise possible it stood there absolutely confronted with the material way in which it might be met the way in which it might be met was by his putting his child at peace and the way to put her at peace was to provide for his future that is for hers by marriage by a marriage as good speaking proportionately as hers had been as he fairly inhaled this measure of refreshment he tasted the meaning of recent agitations he had seen that charlotte could contribute what he hadn t seen was what she could contribute to when it had all supremely cleared up and he had simply settled this service to his daughter well before him as the proper direction of his young friend s leisure the cool darkness had again closed round him but his moral lucidity was constituted it wasn t only moreover that the word with a click so fitted the riddle but that the riddle in such perfection fitted the word he might have been equally in want and yet not have had his remedy oh if charlotte didn t accept him of course the remedy would fail but as everything had fallen together it was at least there to be tried and success would be great that was his last throb if the measure of relief effected for maggie should at all prove to have been given by his own actual sense of felicity he really didn t know when in his life he had thought of anything happier to think of it merely for himself would have been even as he had just lately felt even doing all justice to that condition yes impossible but there was a grand difference in thinking of it for his child xii it was at brighton above all that this difference came out it was during the three wonderful days he spent there with charlotte that he had acquainted himself further though doubtless not even now quite completely with the merits of his majestic scheme and while moreover to begin with he still but held his vision in place steadying it fairly with his hands as he had often steadied for inspection a precarious old pot or kept a glazed picture in its right relation to the light the other the outer presumptions in his favour those independent of what he might himself contribute and that therefore till he should speak remained necessarily vague that quantity i say struck him as positively multiplying as putting on in the fresh brighton air and on the sunny brighton front a kind of tempting palpability he liked in this preliminary stage to feel that he should be able to speak and that he would the word itself being romantic pressing for him the spring of association with stories and plays where handsome and ardent young men in uniforms tights cloaks high boots had it in soliloquies ever on their lips and the sense on the first day that he should probably have taken the great step before the second was over conduced already to make him say to his companion that they must spend more than their mere night or two at his ease on the ground of what was before him he at all events definitely desired to be and it was strongly his impression that he was proceeding step by step he was acting it kept coming back to that not in the dark but in the high golden morning not in precipitation flurry fever dangers these of the path of passion properly so called but with the deliberation of a plan a plan that might be a thing of less joy than a passion but that probably would in compensation for that loss be found to have the essential property to wear even the decent dignity of reaching further and of providing for more contingencies the season was in local parlance on the elements were assembled the big windy hotel the draughty social hall swarmed with types in charlotte s constant phrase and resounded with a din in which the wild music of gilded and befrogged bands croatian dalmatian carpathian violently exotic and nostalgic was distinguished as struggling against the perpetual popping of corks much of this would decidedly have disconcerted our friends if it hadn t all happened more preponderantly to give them the brighter surprise the noble privacy of fawns had left them had left mr verver at least with a little accumulated sum of tolerance to spend on the high pitch and high colour of the public sphere fawns as it had been for him and as maggie and fanny assingham had both attested was out of the world whereas the scene actually about him with the very sea a mere big booming medium for excursions and aquariums affected him as so plump in the conscious centre that nothing could have been more complete for representing that pulse of life which they had come to unanimity at home on the subject of their advisedly not hereafter forgetting the pulse of life was what charlotte in her way at home had lately reproduced and there were positively current hours when it might have been open to her companion to feel himself again indebted to her for introductions he had brought her to put it crudely but it was almost as if she were herself in her greater gaiety her livelier curiosity and intensity her readier happier irony taking him about and showing him the place no one really when he came to think had ever taken him about before it had always been he of old who took others and who in particular took maggie this quickly fell into its relation with him as part of an experience marking for him no doubt what people call considerately a time of life a new and pleasant order a flattered passive state that might become why shouldn t it one of the comforts of the future mr gutermann seuss proved on the second day our friend had waited till then a remarkably genial a positively lustrous young man occupying a small neat house in a quarter of the place remote from the front and living as immediate and striking signs testified in the bosom of his family our visitors found themselves introduced by the operation of close contiguity to a numerous group of ladies and gentlemen older and younger and of children larger and smaller who mostly affected them as scarce less anointed for hospitality and who produced at first the impression of a birthday party of some anniversary gregariously and religiously kept though they subsequently fell into their places as members of one quiet domestic circle preponderantly and directly indebted for their being in fact to mr gutermann seuss to the casual eye a mere smart and shining youth of less than thirty summers faultlessly appointed in every particular he yet stood among his progeny eleven in all as he confessed without a sigh eleven little brown clear faces yet with such impersonal old eyes astride of such impersonal old noses while he entertained the great american collector whom he had so long hoped he might meet and whose charming companion the handsome frank familiar young lady presumably mrs verver noticed the graduated offspring noticed the fat ear ringed aunts and the glossy cockneyfied familiar uncles inimitable of accent and assumption and of an attitude of cruder intention than that of the head of the firm noticed the place in short noticed the treasure produced noticed everything as from the habit of a person finding her account at any time according to a wisdom well learned of life in almost any funny impression it really came home to her friend on the spot that this free range of observation in her picking out the frequent funny with extraordinary promptness would verily henceforth make a different thing for him of such experiences of the customary hunt for the possible prize the inquisitive play of his accepted monomania which different thing could probably be a lighter and perhaps thereby a somewhat more boisterously refreshing form of sport such omens struck him as vivid in any case when mr gutermann seuss with a sharpness of discrimination he had at first scarce seemed to promise invited his eminent couple into another room before the threshold of which the rest of the tribe unanimously faltering dropped out of the scene the treasure itself here the objects on behalf of which mr verver s interest had been booked established quickly enough their claim to engage the latter s attention yet at what point of his past did our friend s memory looking back and back catch him in any such place thinking so much less of wares artfully paraded than of some other and quite irrelevant presence such places were not strange to him when they took the form of bourgeois back parlours a trifle ominously grey and grim from their north light at watering places prevailingly homes of humbug or even when they wore some aspect still less if not perhaps still more insidious he had been everywhere pried and prowled everywhere going on occasion so far as to risk he believed life health and the very bloom of honour but where while precious things extracted one by one from thrice locked yet often vulgar drawers and soft satchels of old oriental ilk were impressively ranged before him had he till now let himself in consciousness wander like one of the vague he didn t betray it ah that he knew but two recognitions took place for him at once and one of them suffered a little in sweetness by the confusion mr gutermann seuss had truly for the crisis the putting down of his cards a rare manner he was perfect master of what not to say to such a personage as mr verver while the particular importance that dispenses with chatter was diffused by his movements themselves his repeated act of passage between a featureless mahogany meuble and a table so virtuously disinterested as to look fairly smug under a cotton cloth of faded maroon and indigo all redolent of patriarchal teas the damascene tiles successively and oh so tenderly unmuffled and revealed lay there at last in their full harmony and their venerable splendour but the tribute of appreciation and decision was while the spectator considered simplified to a point that but just failed of representing levity on the part of a man who had always acknowledged without shame in such affairs the intrinsic charm of what was called discussion the infinitely ancient the immemorial amethystine blue of the glaze scarcely more meant to be breathed upon it would seem than the cheek of royalty this property of the ordered and matched array had inevitably all its determination for him but his submission was perhaps for the first time in his life of the quick mind alone the process really itself in its way as fine as the perfection perceived and admired every inch of the rest of him being given to the foreknowledge that an hour or two later he should have spoken the burning of his ships therefore waited too near to let him handle his opportunity with his usual firm and sentient fingers waited somehow in the predominance of charlotte s very person in her being there exactly as she was capable as mr gutermann seuss himself was capable of the right felicity of silence but with an embracing ease through it all that made deferred criticism as fragrant as some joy promised a lover by his mistress or as a big bridal bouquet held patiently behind her he couldn t otherwise have explained surely why he found himself thinking to his enjoyment of so many other matters than the felicity of his acquisition and the figure of his cheque quite equally high any more than why later on with their return to the room in which they had been received and the renewed encompassment of the tribe he felt quite merged in the elated circle formed by the girl s free response to the collective caress of all the shining eyes and by her genial acceptance of the heavy cake and port wine that as she was afterwards to note added to their transaction for a finish the touch of some mystic rite of old jewry this characterisation came from her as they walked away walked together in the waning afternoon back to the breezy sea and the bustling front back to the nimble and the flutter and the shining shops that sharpened the grin of solicitation on the mask of night they were walking thus as he felt nearer and nearer to where he should see his ships burn and it was meanwhile for him quite as if this red glow would impart at the harmonious hour a lurid grandeur to his good faith it was meanwhile too a sign of the kind of sensibility often playing up in him that fabulous as this truth may sound he found a sentimental link an obligation of delicacy or perhaps even one of the penalties of its opposite in his having exposed her to the north light the quite properly hard business light of the room in which they had been alone with the treasure and its master she had listened to the name of the sum he was capable of looking in the face given the relation of intimacy with him she had already beyond all retractation accepted the stir of the air produced at the other place by that high figure struck him as a thing that from the moment she had exclaimed or protested as little as he himself had apologised left him but one thing more to do a man of decent feeling didn t thrust his money a huge lump of it in such a way under a poor girl s nose a girl whose poverty was after a fashion the very basis of her enjoyment of his hospitality without seeing logically a responsibility attached and this was to remain none the less true for the fact that twenty minutes later after he had applied his torch applied it with a sign or two of insistence what might definitely result failed to be immediately clear he had spoken spoken as they sat together on the out of the way bench observed during one of their walks and kept for the previous quarter of the present hour well in his memory s eye the particular spot to which between intense pauses and intenser advances he had all the while consistently led her below the great consolidated cliff well on to where the city of stucco sat most architecturally perched with the rumbling beach and the rising tide and the freshening stars in front and above the safe sense of the whole place yet prevailed in lamps and seats and flagged walks hovering also overhead in the close neighbourhood of a great replete community about to assist anew at the removal of dish covers we ve had as it seems to me such quite beautiful days together that i hope it won t come to you too much as a shock when i ask if you think you could regard me with any satisfaction as a husband as if he had known she wouldn t she of course couldn t at all gracefully and whether or no reply with a rush he had said a little more quite as he had felt he must in thinking it out in advance he had put the question on which there was no going back and which represented thereby the sacrifice of his vessels and what he further said was to stand for the redoubled thrust of flame that would make combustion sure this isn t sudden to me and i ve wondered at moments if you haven t felt me coming to it i ve been coming ever since we left fawns i really started while we were there he spoke slowly giving her as he desired time to think all the more that it was making her look at him steadily and making her also in a remarkable degree look well while she did so a large and so far a happy consequence she wasn t at all events shocked which he had glanced at but for a handsome humility and he would give her as many minutes as she liked you mustn t think i m forgetting that i m not young oh that isn t so it s i that am old you are young this was what she had at first answered and quite in the tone too of having taken her minutes it had not been wholly to the point but it had been kind which was what he most wanted and she kept for her next words to kindness kept to her clear lowered voice and unshrinking face to me too it thoroughly seems that these days have been beautiful i shouldn t be grateful to them if i couldn t more or less have imagined their bringing us to this she affected him somehow as if she had advanced a step to meet him and yet were at the same time standing still it only meant however doubtless that she was gravely and reasonably thinking as he exactly desired to make her if she would but think enough she would probably think to suit him it seems to me she went on that it s for you to be sure ah but i am sure said adam verver on matters of importance i never speak when i m not so if you can yourself face such a union you needn t in the least trouble she had another pause and she might have been felt as facing it while through lamplight and dusk through the breath of the mild slightly damp southwest she met his eyes without evasion yet she had at the end of another minute debated only to the extent of saying i won t pretend i don t think it would be good for me to marry good for me i mean she pursued because i m so awfully unattached i should like to be a little less adrift i should like to have a home i should like to have an existence i should like to have a motive for one thing more than another a motive outside of myself in fact she said so sincerely that it almost showed pain yet so lucidly that it almost showed humour in fact you know i want to be married it s well it s the condition the condition he was just vague it s the state i mean i don t like my own miss among us all is too dreadful except for a shopgirl i don t want to be a horrible english old maid oh you want to be taken care of very well then i ll do it i dare say it s very much that only i don t see why for what i speak of she smiled for a mere escape from my state i need do quite so much so much as marry me in particular her smile was as for true directness i might get what i want for less you think it so much for you to do yes she presently said i think it s a great deal then it was that though she was so gentle so quite perfect with him and he felt he had come on far then it was that of a sudden something seemed to fail and he didn t quite know where they were there rose for him with this the fact to be sure of their disparity deny it as mercifully and perversely as she would he might have been her father of course yes that s my disadvantage i m not the natural i m so far from being the ideal match to your youth and your beauty i ve the drawback that you ve seen me always so inevitably in such another light but she gave a slow headshake that made contradiction soft made it almost sad in fact as from having to be so complete and he had already before she spoke the dim vision of some objection in her mind beside which the one he had named was light and which therefore must be strangely deep you don t understand me it s of all that it is for you to do it s of that i m thinking oh with this for him the thing was clearer then you needn t think i know enough what it is for me to do but she shook her head again i doubt if you know i doubt if you can and why not please when i ve had you so before me that i m old has at least that fact about it to the good that i ve known you long and from far back do you think you ve known me asked charlotte stant he hesitated for the tone of it and her look with it might have made him doubt just these things in themselves however with all the rest with his fixed purpose now his committed deed the fine pink glow projected forward of his ships behind him definitely blazing and crackling this quantity was to push him harder than any word of her own could warn him all that she was herself moreover was so lighted to its advantage by the pink glow he wasn t rabid but he wasn t either as a man of a proper spirit to be frightened what is that then if i accept it but as strong a reason as i can want for just learning to know you she faced him always kept it up as for honesty and yet at the same time in her odd way as for mercy how can you tell whether if you did you would it was ambiguous for an instant as she showed she felt i mean when it s a question of learning one learns sometimes too late i think it s a question he promptly enough made answer of liking you the more just for your saying these things you should make something he added of my liking you i make everything but are you sure of having exhausted all other ways this of a truth enlarged his gaze but what other ways why you ve more ways of being kind than anyone i ever knew take it then he answered that i m simply putting them all together for you she looked at him on this long again still as if it shouldn t be said she hadn t given him time or had withdrawn from his view so to speak a single inch of her surface this at least she was fully to have exposed it represented her as oddly conscientious and he scarce knew in what sense it affected him on the whole however with admiration you re very very honourable it s just what i want to be i don t see she added why you re not right i don t see why you re not happy as you are i can not ask myself i can not ask you she went on if you re really as much at liberty as your universal generosity leads you to assume oughtn t we she asked to think a little of others oughtn t i at least in loyalty at any rate in delicacy to think of maggie with which intensely gentle so as not to appear too much to teach him his duty she explained she s everything to you she has always been are you so certain that there s room in your life for another daughter is that what you mean she had not hung upon it long but he had quickly taken her up he had not however disconcerted her for another young woman very much of her age and whose relation to her has always been so different from what our marrying would make it for another companion said charlotte stant can t a man be all his life then he almost fiercely asked anything but a father but he went on before she could answer you talk about differences but they ve been already made as no one knows better than maggie she feels the one she made herself by her own marriage made i mean for me she constantly thinks of it it allows her no rest to put her at peace is therefore he explained what i m trying with you to do i can t do it alone but i can do it with your help you can make her he said positively happy about me about you she thoughtfully echoed but what can i make her about herself oh if she s at ease about me the rest will take care of itself the case he declared is in your hands you ll effectually put out of her mind that i feel she has abandoned me interest certainly now was what he had kindled in her face but it was all the more honourable to her as he had just called it that she should want to see each of the steps of his conviction if you ve been driven to the likes of me mayn t it show that you ve felt truly forsaken well i m willing to suggest that if i can show at the same time that i feel consoled but have you she demanded really felt so he hesitated consoled forsaken no i haven t but if it s her idea if it was her idea in short that was enough this enunciation of motive the next moment however sounded to him perhaps slightly thin so that he gave it another touch that is if it s my idea i happen you see to like my idea well it s beautiful and wonderful but isn t it possibly charlotte asked not quite enough to marry me for why so my dear child isn t a man s idea usually what he does marry for charlotte considering looked as if this might perhaps be a large question or at all events something of an extension of one they were immediately concerned with doesn t that a good deal depend on the sort of thing it may be she suggested that about marriage ideas as he called them might differ with which however giving no more time to it she sounded another question don t you appear rather to put it to me that i may accept your offer for maggie s sake somehow she turned it over i don t so clearly see her quite so much finding reassurance or even quite so much needing it do you then make nothing at all of her having been so ready to leave us ah charlotte on the contrary made much she was ready to leave us because she had to be from the moment the prince wanted it she could only go with him perfectly so that if you see your way she will be able to go with him in future as much as she likes charlotte appeared to examine for a minute in maggie s interest this privilege the result of which was a limited concession you ve certainly worked it out of course i ve worked it out that s exactly what i have done she hadn t for a long time been so happy about anything as at your being there with me i was to be with you said charlotte for her security well adam verver rang out this is her security you ve only if you can t see it to ask her ask her the girl echoed it in wonder certainly in so many words telling her you don t believe me still she debated do you mean write it to her quite so immediately to morrow oh i don t think i can write it said charlotte stant when i write to her and she looked amused for so different a shade it s about the principino s appetite and dr brady s visits very good then put it to her face to face we ll go straight to paris to meet them charlotte at this rose with a movement that was like a small cry but her unspoken sense lost itself while she stood with her eyes on him he keeping his seat as for the help it gave him a little to make his appeal go up presently however a new sense had come to her and she covered him kindly with the expression of it i do think you know you must rather like me thank you said adam verver you will put it to her yourself then she had another hesitation we go over you say to meet them as soon as we can get back to fawns and wait there for them if necessary till they come wait a at fawns wait in paris that will be charming in itself you take me to pleasant places she turned it over you propose to me beautiful things it rests but with you to make them beautiful and pleasant you ve made brighton ah she almost tenderly protested with what i m doing now you re promising me now what i want aren t you promising me he pressed getting up aren t you promising me to abide by what maggie says oh she wanted to be sure she was do you mean she ll ask it of me it gave him indeed as by communication a sense of the propriety of being himself certain yet what was he but certain she ll speak to you she ll speak to you for me this at last then seemed to satisfy her very good may we wait again to talk of it till she has done so he showed with his hands down in his pockets and his shoulders expressively up a certain disappointment soon enough none the less his gentleness was all back and his patience once more exemplary of course i give you time especially he smiled as it s time that i shall be spending with you our keeping on together will help you perhaps to see to see i mean how i need you i already see said charlotte how you ve persuaded yourself you do but she had to repeat it that isn t unfortunately all well then how you ll make maggie right right she echoed it as if the word went far and o oh she still critically murmured as they moved together away xiii he had talked to her of their waiting in paris a week later but on the spot there this period of patience suffered no great strain he had written to his daughter not indeed from brighton but directly after their return to fawns where they spent only forty eight hours before resuming their journey and maggie s reply to his news was a telegram from rome delivered to him at noon of their fourth day and which he brought out to charlotte who was seated at that moment in the court of the hotel where they had agreed that he should join her for their proceeding together to the noontide meal his letter at fawns a letter of several pages and intended lucidly unreservedly in fact all but triumphantly to inform had proved on his sitting down to it and a little to his surprise not quite so simple a document to frame as even his due consciousness of its weight of meaning had allowed him to assume this doubtless however only for reasons naturally latent in the very wealth of that consciousness which contributed to his message something of their own quality of impatience the main result of their talk for the time had been a difference in his relation to his young friend as well as a difference equally sensible in her relation to himself and this in spite of his not having again renewed his undertaking to speak to her so far even as to tell her of the communication despatched to rome delicacy a delicacy more beautiful still all the delicacy she should want reigned between them it being rudimentary in their actual order that she mustn t be further worried until maggie should have put her at her ease it was just the delicacy however that in paris which suggestively was brighton at a hundredfold higher pitch made between him and his companion the tension made the suspense made what he would have consented perhaps to call the provisional peculiarity of present conditions these elements acted in a manner of their own imposing and involving under one head many abstentions and precautions twenty anxieties and reminders things verily he would scarce have known how to express and yet creating for them at every step an acceptance of their reality he was hanging back with charlotte till another person should intervene for their assistance and yet they had by what had already occurred been carried on to something it was out of the power of other persons to make either less or greater common conventions that was what was odd had to be on this basis more thought of those common conventions that previous to the passage by the brighton strand he had so enjoyed the sense of their overlooking the explanation would have been he supposed or would have figured it with less of unrest that paris had in its way deeper voices and warnings so that if you went at all far there it laid bristling traps as they might have been viewed all smothered in flowers for your going further still there were strange appearances in the air and before you knew it you might be unmistakably matching them since he wished therefore to match no appearance but that of a gentleman playing with perfect fairness any game in life he might be called to he found himself on the receipt of maggie s missive rejoicing with a certain inconsistency the announcement made her from home had in the act cost some biting of his pen to sundry parts of him his personal modesty his imagination of her prepared state for so quick a jump it didn t much matter which and yet he was more eager than not for the drop of delay and for the quicker transitions promised by the arrival of the imminent pair there was after all a hint of offence to a man of his age in being taken as they said at the shops on approval maggie certainly would have been as far as charlotte herself from positively desiring this and charlotte on her side as far as maggie from holding him light as a real value she made him fidget thus poor girl but from generous rigour of conscience these allowances of his spirit were all the same consistent with a great gladness at the sight of the term of his ordeal for it was the end of his seeming to agree that questions and doubts had a place the more he had inwardly turned the matter over the more it had struck him that they had in truth only an ugliness what he could have best borne as he now believed would have been charlotte s simply saying to him that she didn t like him enough this he wouldn t have enjoyed but he would quite have understood it and been able ruefully to submit she did like him enough nothing to contradict that had come out for him so that he was restless for her as well as for himself she looked at him hard a moment when he handed her his telegram and the look for what he fancied a dim shy fear in it gave him perhaps his best moment of conviction that as a man so to speak he properly pleased her he said nothing the words sufficiently did it for him doing it again better still as charlotte who had left her chair at his approach murmured them out we start to night to bring you all our love and joy and sympathy there they were the words and what did she want more she didn t however as she gave him back the little unfolded leaf say they were enough though he saw the next moment that her silence was probably not disconnected from her having just visibly turned pale her extraordinarily fine eyes as it was his present theory that he had always thought them shone at him the more darkly out of this change of colour and she had again with it her apparent way of subjecting herself for explicit honesty and through her willingness to face him to any view he might take all at his ease and even to wantonness of the condition he produced in her as soon as he perceived that emotion kept her soundless he knew himself deeply touched since it proved that little as she professed she had been beautifully hoping they stood there a minute while he took in from this sign that yes then certainly she liked him enough liked him enough to make him old as he was ready to brand himself flush for the pleasure of it the pleasure of it accordingly made him speak first do you begin a little to be satisfied still however she had to think we ve hurried them you see why so breathless a start because they want to congratulate us they want said adam verver to see our happiness she wondered again and this time also for him as publicly as possible so much as that do you think it s too much she continued to think plainly they weren t to have started for another week well what then isn t our situation worth the little sacrifice we ll go back to rome as soon as you like with them this seemed to hold her as he had previously seen her held just a trifle inscrutably by his allusions to what they would do together on a certain contingency worth it the little sacrifice for whom for us naturally yes she said we want to see them for our reasons that is she rather dimly smiled you do and you do my dear too he bravely declared yes then i do too she after an instant ungrudging enough acknowledged for us however something depends on it rather but does nothing depend on it for them what can from the moment that as appears they don t want to nip us in the bud i can imagine their rushing up to prevent us but an enthusiasm for us that can wait so very little such intense eagerness i confess she went on more than a little puzzles me you may think me she also added ungracious and suspicious but the prince can t at all want to come back so soon he wanted quite too intensely to get away mr verver considered well hasn t he been away yes just long enough to see how he likes it besides said charlotte he may not be able to join in the rosy view of our case that you impute to her it can t in the least have appeared to him hitherto a matter of course that you should give his wife a bouncing stepmother adam verver at this looked grave i m afraid then he ll just have to accept from us whatever his wife accepts and accept it if he can imagine no better reason just because she does that he declared will have to do for him his tone made her for a moment meet his face after which let me she abruptly said see it again taking from him the folded leaf that she had given back and he had kept in his hand isn t the whole thing she asked when she had read it over perhaps but a way like another for their gaining time he again stood staring but the next minute with that upward spring of his shoulders and that downward pressure of his pockets which she had already more than once at disconcerted moments determined in him he turned sharply away and wandered from her in silence he looked about in his small despair he crossed the hotel court which overarched and glazed muffled against loud sounds and guarded against crude sights heated gilded draped almost carpeted with exotic trees in tubs exotic ladies in chairs the general exotic accent and presence suspended as with wings folded or feebly fluttering in the superior the supreme the inexorably enveloping parisian medium resembled some critical apartment of large capacity some dental medical surgical waiting room a scene of mixed anxiety and desire preparatory for gathered barbarians to the due amputation or extraction of excrescences and redundancies of barbarism he went as far as the porte cochere took counsel afresh of his usual optimism sharpened even somehow just here by the very air he tasted and then came back smiling to charlotte it is incredible to you that when a man is still as much in love as amerigo his most natural impulse should be to feel what his wife feels to believe what she believes to want what she wants in the absence that is of special impediments to his so doing the manner of it operated she acknowledged with no great delay this natural possibility no nothing is incredible to me of people immensely in love well isn t amerigo immensely in love she hesitated but as for the right expression of her sense of the degree but she after all adopted mr verver s immensely then there you are she had another smile however she wasn t there quite yet that isn t all that s wanted but what more why that his wife shall have made him really believe that she really believes with which charlotte became still more lucidly logical the reality of his belief will depend in such a case on the reality of hers the prince may for instance now she went on have made out to his satisfaction that maggie may mainly desire to abound in your sense whatever it is you do he may remember that he has never seen her do anything else well said adam verver what kind of a warning will he have found in that to what catastrophe will he have observed such a disposition in her to lead just to this one with which she struck him as rising straighter and clearer before him than she had done even yet our little question itself her appearance had in fact at the moment such an effect on him that he could answer but in marvelling mildness hadn t we better wait a while till we call it a catastrophe her rejoinder to this was to wait though by no means as long as he meant when at the end of her minute she spoke however it was mildly too what would you like dear friend to wait for it lingered between them in the air this demand and they exchanged for the time a look which might have made each of them seem to have been watching in the other the signs of its overt irony these were indeed immediately so visible in mr verver s face that as if a little ashamed of having so markedly produced them and as if also to bring out at last under pressure something she had all the while been keeping back she took a jump to pure plain reason you haven t noticed for yourself but i can t quite help noticing that in spite of what you assume we assume if you like maggie wires her joy only to you she makes no sign of its overflow to me it was a point and staring a moment he took account of it but he had as before his presence of mind to say nothing of his kindly humour why you complain of the very thing that s most charmingly conclusive she treats us already as one clearly now for the girl in spite of lucidity and logic there was something in the way he said things she faced him in all her desire to please him and then her word quite simply and definitely showed it i do like you you know well what could this do but stimulate his humour i see what s the matter with you you won t be quiet till you ve heard from the prince himself i think the happy man added that i ll go and secretly wire to him that you d like reply paid a few words for yourself it could apparently but encourage her further to smile reply paid for him you mean or for me oh i ll pay with pleasure anything back for you as many words as you like and he went on to keep it up not requiring either to see your message she could take it visibly as he meant it should you require to see the prince s not a bit you can keep that also to yourself on his speaking however as if his transmitting the hint were a real question she appeared to consider and almost as if for good taste that the joke had gone far enough it doesn t matter unless he speaks of his own movement and why should it be she asked a thing that would occur to him i really think mr verver concurred that it naturally wouldn t he doesn t know you re morbid she just wondered but she agreed no he hasn t yet found it out perhaps he will but he hasn t yet and i m willing to give him meanwhile the benefit of the doubt so with this the situation to her view would appear to have cleared had she not too quickly had one of her restless relapses maggie however does know i m morbid she hasn t the benefit well said adam verver a little wearily at last i think i feel that you ll hear from her yet it had even fairly come over him under recurrent suggestion that his daughter s omission was surprising and maggie had never in her life been wrong for more than three minutes oh it isn t that i hold that i ve a right to it charlotte the next instant rather oddly qualified and the observation itself gave him a further push very well i shall like it myself at this then as if moved by his way of constantly and more or less against his own contention coming round to her she showed how she could also always and not less gently come half way i speak of it only as the missing grace the grace that s in everything that maggie does it isn t my due she kept it up but taking from you that we may still expect it it will have the touch it will be beautiful then come out to breakfast mr verver had looked at his watch it will be here when we get back if it isn t and charlotte smiled as she looked about for a feather boa that she had laid down on descending from her room if it isn t it will have had but that slight fault he saw her boa on the arm of the chair from which she had moved to meet him and after he had fetched it raising it to make its charming softness brush his face for it was a wondrous product of paris purchased under his direct auspices the day before he held it there a minute before giving it up will you promise me then to be at peace she looked while she debated at his admirable present i promise you quite for ever quite for ever remember he went on to justify his demand remember that in wiring you she ll naturally speak even more for her husband than she has done in wiring me it was only at a word that charlotte had a demur naturally why our marriage puts him for you you see or puts you for him into a new relation whereas it leaves his relation to me unchanged it therefore gives him more to say to you about it about its making me his stepmother in law or whatever i should become over which for a little she not undivertedly mused yes there may easily be enough for a gentleman to say to a young woman about that well amerigo can always be according to the case either as funny or as serious as you like and whichever he may be for you in sending you a message he ll be it all and then as the girl with one of her so deeply and oddly yet so tenderly critical looks at him failed to take up the remark he found himself moved as by a vague anxiety to add a question don t you think he s charming oh charming said charlotte stant if he weren t i shouldn t mind no more should i her friend harmoniously returned ah but you don t mind you don t have to you don t have to i mean as i have it s the last folly ever to care in an anxious way the least particle more than one is absolutely forced if i were you she went on if i had in my life for happiness and power and peace even a small fraction of what you have it would take a great deal to make me waste my worry i don t know she said what in the world that didn t touch my luck i should trouble my head about i quite understand you yet doesn t it just depend mr verver asked on what you call one s luck it s exactly my luck that i m talking about i shall be as sublime as you like when you ve made me all right it s only when one is right that one really has the things you speak of it isn t they he explained that make one so it s the something else i want that makes them right if you ll give me what i ask you ll see she had taken her boa and thrown it over her shoulders and her eyes while she still delayed had turned from him engaged by another interest though the court was by this time the hour of dispersal for luncheon so forsaken that they would have had it for free talk should they have been moved to loudness quite to themselves she was ready for their adjournment but she was also aware of a pedestrian youth in uniform a visible emissary of the postes et telegraphes who had approached from the street the small stronghold of the concierge and who presented there a missive taken from the little cartridge box slung over his shoulder the portress meeting him on the threshold met equally across the court charlotte s marked attention to his visit so that within the minute she had advanced to our friends with her cap streamers flying and her smile of announcement as ample as her broad white apron she raised aloft a telegraphic message and as she delivered it sociably discriminated cette fois ci pour madame with which she as genially retreated leaving charlotte in possession charlotte taking it held it at first unopened her eyes had come back to her companion who had immediately and triumphantly greeted it ah there you are she broke the envelope then in silence and for a minute as with the message he himself had put before her studied its contents without a sign he watched her without a question and at last she looked up i ll give you she simply said what you ask the expression of her face was strange but since when had a woman s at moments of supreme surrender not a right to be he took it in with his own long look and his grateful silence so that nothing more for some instants passed between them their understanding sealed itself he already felt that she had made him right but he was in presence too of the fact that maggie had made her so and always therefore without maggie where in fine would he be she united them brought them together as with the click of a silver spring and on the spot with the vision of it his eyes filled charlotte facing him meanwhile with her expression made still stranger by the blur of his gratitude through it all however he smiled what my child does for me through it all as well that is still through the blur he saw charlotte rather than heard her reply she held her paper wide open but her eyes were all for his it isn t maggie it s the prince i say he gaily rang out then it s best of all it s enough thank you for thinking so to which he added it s enough for our question but it isn t is it quite enough for our breakfast dejeunons she stood there however in spite of this appeal her document always before them don t you want to read it he thought not if it satisfies you i don t require it but she gave him as for her conscience another chance you can if you like he hesitated afresh but as for amiability not for curiosity is it funny thus finally she again dropped her eyes on it drawing in her lips a little no i call it grave ah then i don t want it very grave said charlotte stant well what did i tell you of him he asked rejoicing as they started a question for all answer to which before she took his arm the girl thrust her paper crumpled into the pocket of her coat part third xiv charlotte half way up the monumental staircase had begun by waiting alone waiting to be rejoined by her companion who had gone down all the way as in common kindness bound and who his duty performed would know where to find her she was meanwhile though extremely apparent not perhaps absolutely advertised but she would not have cared if she had been so little was it by this time her first occasion of facing society with a consciousness materially with a confidence quite splendidly enriched for a couple of years now she had known as never before what it was to look well to look that is as well as she had always felt from far back that in certain conditions she might on such an evening as this that of a great official party in the full flush of the london spring time the conditions affected her her nerves her senses her imagination as all profusely present so that perhaps at no moment yet had she been so justified of her faith as at the particular instant of our being again concerned with her that of her chancing to glance higher up from where she stood and meeting in consequence the quiet eyes of colonel assingham who had his elbows on the broad balustrade of the great gallery overhanging the staircase and who immediately exchanged with her one of his most artlessly familiar signals this simplicity of his visual attention struck her even with the other things she had to think about as the quietest note in the whole high pitch much in fact as if she had pressed a finger on a chord or a key and created for the number of seconds an arrest of vibration a more muffled thump the sight of him suggested indeed that fanny would be there though so far as opportunity went she had not seen her this was about the limit of what it could suggest the air however had suggestions enough it abounded in them many of them precisely helping to constitute those conditions with which for our young woman the hour was brilliantly crowned she was herself in truth crowned and it all hung together melted together in light and colour and sound the unsurpassed diamonds that her head so happily carried the other jewels the other perfections of aspect and arrangement that made her personal scheme a success the proved private theory that materials to work with had been all she required and that there were none too precious for her to understand and use to which might be added lastly as the strong scented flower of the total sweetness an easy command a high enjoyment of her crisis for a crisis she was ready to take it and this ease it was doubtless that helped her while she waited to the right assurance to the right indifference to the right expression and above all as she felt to the right view of her opportunity for happiness unless indeed the opportunity itself rather were in its mere strange amplitude the producing the precipitating cause the ordered revellers rustling and shining with sweep of train and glitter of star and clink of sword and yet for all this but so imperfectly articulate so vaguely vocal the double stream of the coming and the going flowing together where she stood passed her brushed her treated her to much crude contemplation and now and then to a spasm of speech an offered hand even in some cases to an unencouraged pause but she missed no countenance and invited no protection she fairly liked to be so long as she might just as she was exposed a little to the public no doubt in her unaccompanied state but even if it were a bit brazen careless of queer reflections on the dull polish of london faces and exposed since it was a question of exposure to much more competent recognitions of her own she hoped no one would stop she was positively keeping herself it was her idea to mark in a particular manner the importance of something that had just happened she knew how she should mark it and what she was doing there made already a beginning when presently therefore from her standpoint she saw the prince come back she had an impression of all the place as higher and wider and more appointed for great moments with its dome of lustres lifted its ascents and descents more majestic its marble tiers more vividly overhung its numerosity of royalties foreign and domestic more unprecedented its symbolism of state hospitality both emphasised and refined this was doubtless a large consequence of a fairly familiar cause a considerable inward stir to spring from the mere vision striking as that might be of amerigo in a crowd but she had her reasons she held them there she carried them in fact responsibly and overtly as she carried her head her high tiara her folded fan her indifferent unattended eminence and it was when he reached her and she could taking his arm show herself as placed in her relation that she felt supremely justified it was her notion of course that she gave a glimpse of but few of her grounds for this discrimination indeed of the most evident alone yet she would have been half willing it should be guessed how she drew inspiration drew support in quantity sufficient for almost anything from the individual value that through all the picture her husband s son in law kept for the eye deriving it from his fine unconscious way in the swarming social sum of outshining overlooking and overtopping it was as if in separation even the shortest she half forgot or disbelieved how he affected her sight so that reappearance had in him each time a virtue of its own a kind of disproportionate intensity suggesting his connection with occult sources of renewal what did he do when he was away from her that made him always come back only looking as she would have called it more so superior to any shade of cabotinage he yet almost resembled an actor who between his moments on the stage revisits his dressing room and before the glass pressed by his need of effect retouches his make up the prince was at present for instance though he had quitted her but ten minutes before still more than then the person it pleased her to be left with a truth that had all its force for her while he made her his care for their conspicuous return together to the upper rooms conspicuous beyond any wish they could entertain was what poor wonderful man he couldn t help making it and when she raised her eyes again on the ascent to bob assingham still aloft in his gallery and still looking down at her she was aware that in spite of hovering and warning inward voices she even enjoyed the testimony rendered by his lonely vigil to the lustre she reflected he was always lonely at great parties the dear colonel it wasn t in such places that the seed he sowed at home was ever reaped by him but nobody could have seemed to mind it less to brave it with more bronzed indifference so markedly that he moved about less like one of the guests than like some quite presentable person in charge of the police arrangements or the electric light to mrs verver as will be seen he represented with the perfect good faith of his apparent blankness something definite enough though her bravery was not thereby too blighted for her to feel herself calling him to witness that the only witchcraft her companion had used within the few minutes was that of attending maggie who had withdrawn from the scene to her carriage notified at all events of fanny s probable presence charlotte was for a while after this divided between the sense of it as a fact somehow to reckon with and deal with which was a perception that made in its degree for the prudence the pusillanimity of postponement of avoidance and a quite other feeling an impatience that presently ended by prevailing an eagerness really to be suspected sounded veritably arraigned if only that she might have the bad moment over if only that she might prove to herself let alone to mrs assingham also that she could convert it to good if only in short to be square as they said with her question for herself indeed particularly it wasn t a question but something in her bones told her that fanny would treat it as one and there was truly nothing that from this friend she was not bound in decency to take she might hand things back with every tender precaution with acknowledgments and assurances but she owed it to them in any case and it to all mrs assingham had done for her not to get rid of them without having well unwrapped and turned them over to night as happened and she recognised it more and more with the ebbing minutes as an influence of everything about her to night exactly she would no doubt since she knew why be as firm as she might at any near moment again hope to be for going through that process with the right temper and tone she said after a little to the prince stay with me let no one take you for i want her yes i do want her to see us together and the sooner the better said it to keep her hand on him through constant diversions and made him in fact by saying it profess a momentary vagueness she had to explain to him that it was fanny assingham she wanted to see who clearly would be there since the colonel never either stirred without her or once arrived concerned himself for her fate and she had further after amerigo had met her with see us together why in the world hasn t she often seen us together to inform him that what had elsewhere and otherwise happened didn t now matter and that she at any rate well knew for the occasion what she was about you re strange cara mia he consentingly enough dropped but for whatever strangeness he kept her as they circulated from being waylaid even remarking to her afresh as he had often done before on the help rendered in such situations by the intrinsic oddity of the london squash a thing of vague slow senseless eddies revolving as in fear of some menace of conversation suspended over it the drop of which with some consequent refreshing splash or spatter yet never took place of course she was strange this as they went charlotte knew for herself how could she be anything else when the situation holding her and holding him for that matter just as much had so the stamp of it she had already accepted her consciousness as we have already noted that a crisis for them all was in the air and when such hours were not depressing which was the form indeed in which she had mainly known them they were apparently in a high degree exhilarating later on in a corner to which at sight of an empty sofa mrs assingham had after a single attentive arrest led her with a certain earnestness this vision of the critical was much more sharpened than blurred fanny had taken it from her yes she was there with amerigo alone maggie having come with them and then within ten minutes changed her mind repented and departed so you re staying on together without her the elder woman had asked and it was charlotte s answer to this that had determined for them quite indeed according to the latter s expectation the need of some seclusion and her companion s pounce at the sofa they were staying on together alone and oh distinctly it was alone that maggie had driven away her father as usual not having managed to come as usual mrs assingham had seemed to wonder mr verver s reluctances not having she in fact quite intimated hitherto struck her charlotte responded at any rate that his indisposition to go out had lately much increased even though to night as she admitted he had pleaded his not feeling well maggie had wished to stay with him for the prince and she dining out had afterwards called in portland place whence in the event they had brought her charlotte on maggie had come but to oblige her father she had urged the two others to go without her then she had yielded for the time to mr verver s persuasion but here when they had after the long wait in the carriage fairly got in here once up the stairs with the rooms before them remorse had ended by seizing her she had listened to no other remonstrance and at present therefore as charlotte put it the two were doubtless making together a little party at home but it was all right so charlotte also put it there was nothing in the world they liked better than these snatched felicities little parties long talks with i ll come to you to morrow and no i ll come to you make believe renewals of their old life they were fairly at times the dear things like children playing at paying visits playing at mr thompson and mrs fane each hoping that the other would really stay to tea charlotte was sure she should find maggie there on getting home a remark in which mrs verver s immediate response to her friend s inquiry had culminated she had thus on the spot the sense of having given her plenty to think about and that moreover of liking to see it even better than she had expected she had plenty to think about herself and there was already something in fanny that made it seem still more you say your husband s ill he felt too ill to come no my dear i think not if he had been too ill i wouldn t have left him and yet maggie was worried mrs assingham asked she worries you know easily she s afraid of influenza of which he has had at different times though never with the least gravity several attacks but you re not afraid of it charlotte had for a moment a pause it had continued to come to her that really to have her case out as they said with the person in the world to whom her most intimate difficulties had oftenest referred themselves would help her on the whole more than hinder and under that feeling all her opportunity with nothing kept back with a thing or two perhaps even thrust forward seemed temptingly to open besides didn t fanny at bottom half expect absolutely at the bottom half want things so that she would be disappointed if after what must just have occurred for her she didn t get something to put between the teeth of her so restless rumination that cultivation of the fear of which our young woman had already had glimpses that she might have gone too far in her irrepressible interest in other lives what had just happened it pieced itself together for charlotte was that the assingham pair drifting like everyone else had had somewhere in the gallery in the rooms an accidental concussion had it after the colonel over his balustrade had observed in the favouring high light her public junction with the prince his very dryness in this encounter had as always struck a spark from his wife s curiosity and familiar on his side with all that she saw in things he had thrown her as a fine little bone to pick some report of the way one of her young friends was going on with another he knew perfectly such at least was charlotte s liberal assumption that she wasn t going on with anyone but she also knew that given the circumstances she was inevitably to be sacrificed in some form or another to the humorous intercourse of the inimitable couple the prince meanwhile had also under coercion sacrificed her the ambassador had come up to him with a message from royalty to whom he was led away after which she had talked for five minutes with sir john brinder who had been of the ambassador s company and who had rather artlessly remained with her fanny had then arrived in sight of them at the same moment as someone else she didn t know someone who knew mrs assingham and also knew sir john charlotte had left it to her friend s competence to throw the two others immediately together and to find a way for entertaining her in closer quarters this was the little history of the vision in her that was now rapidly helping her to recognise a precious chance the chance that mightn t again soon be so good for the vivid making of a point her point was before her it was sharp bright true above all it was her own she had reached it quite by herself no one not even amerigo amerigo least of all who would have nothing to do with it had given her aid to make it now with force for fanny assingham s benefit would see her further in the direction in which the light had dawned than any other spring she should yet awhile doubtless be able to press the direction was that of her greater freedom which was all in the world she had in mind her opportunity had accordingly after a few minutes of mrs assingham s almost imprudently interested expression of face positively acquired such a price for her that she may for ourselves while the intensity lasted rather resemble a person holding out a small mirror at arm s length and consulting it with a special turn of the head it was in a word with this value of her chance that she was intelligently playing when she said in answer to fanny s last question don t you remember what you told me on the occasion of something or other the other day that you believe there s nothing i m afraid of so my dear don t ask me mayn t i ask you mrs assingham returned how the case stands with your poor husband certainly dear only when you ask me as if i mightn t perhaps know what to think it seems to me best to let you see that i know perfectly what to think mrs assingham hesitated then blinking a little she took her risk you didn t think that if it was a question of anyone s returning to him in his trouble it would be better you yourself should have gone well charlotte s answer to this inquiry visibly shaped itself in the interest of the highest considerations the highest considerations were good humour candour clearness and obviously the real truth if we couldn t be perfectly frank and dear with each other it would be ever so much better wouldn t it that we shouldn t talk about anything at all which however would be dreadful and we certainly at any rate haven t yet come to it you can ask me anything under the sun you like because don t you see you can t upset me i m sure my dear charlotte fanny assingham laughed i don t want to upset you indeed love you simply couldn t even if you thought it necessary that s all i mean nobody could for it belongs to my situation that i m by no merit of my own just fixed fixed as fast as a pin stuck up to its head in a cushion i m placed i can t imagine anyone more placed there i am fanny had indeed never listened to emphasis more firmly applied and it brought into her own eyes though she had reasons for striving to keep them from betrayals a sort of anxiety of intelligence i dare say but your statement of your position however you see it isn t an answer to my inquiry it seems to me at the same time i confess mrs assingham added to give but the more reason for it you speak of our being frank how can we possibly be anything else if maggie has gone off through finding herself too distressed to stay and if she s willing to leave you and her husband to show here without her aren t the grounds of her preoccupation more or less discussable if they re not charlotte replied it s only from their being in a way too evident they re not grounds for me they weren t when i accepted adam s preference that i should come to night without him just as i accept absolutely as a fixed rule all his preferences but that doesn t alter the fact of course that my husband s daughter rather than his wife should have felt she could after all be the one to stay with him the one to make the sacrifice of this hour seeing especially that the daughter has a husband of her own in the field with which she produced as it were her explanation i ve simply to see the truth of the matter see that maggie thinks more on the whole of fathers than of husbands and my situation is such she went on that this becomes immediately don t you understand a thing i have to count with mrs assingham vaguely heaving panting a little but trying not to show it turned about from some inward spring in her seat if you mean such a thing as that she doesn t adore the prince i don t say she doesn t adore him what i say is that she doesn t think of him one of those conditions doesn t always at all stages involve the other this is just how she adores him charlotte said and what reason is there in the world after all why he and i shouldn t as you say show together we ve shown together my dear she smiled before her friend for a little only looked at her speaking then with abruptness you ought to be absolutely happy you live with such good people the effect of it as well was an arrest for charlotte whose face however all of whose fine and slightly hard radiance it had caused the next instant further to brighten does one ever put into words anything so fatuously rash it s a thing that must be said in prudence for one by somebody who s so good as to take the responsibility the more that it gives one always a chance to show one s best manners by not contradicting it certainly you ll never have the distress or whatever of hearing me complain truly my dear i hope in all conscience not and the elder woman s spirit found relief in a laugh more resonant than was quite advised by their pursuit of privacy to this demonstration her friend gave no heed with all our absence after marriage and with the separation from her produced in particular by our so many months in america maggie has still arrears still losses to make up still the need of showing how for so long she simply kept missing him she missed his company a large allowance of which is in spite of everything else of the first necessity to her so she puts it in when she can a little here a little there and it ends by making up a considerable amount the fact of our distinct establishments which has all the same everything in its favour charlotte hastened to declare makes her really see more of him than when they had the same house to make sure she doesn t fail of it she s always arranging for it which she didn t have to do while they lived together but she likes to arrange charlotte steadily proceeded it peculiarly suits her and the result of our separate households is really for them more contact and more intimacy to night for instance has been practically an arrangement she likes him best alone and it s the way said our young woman in which he best likes her it s what i mean therefore by being placed and the great thing is as they say to know one s place doesn t it all strike you she wound up as rather placing the prince too fanny assingham had at this moment the sense as of a large heaped dish presented to her intelligence and inviting it to a feast so thick were the notes of intention in this remarkable speech but she also felt that to plunge at random to help herself too freely would apart from there not being at such a moment time for it tend to jostle the ministering hand confound the array and more vulgarly speaking make a mess so she picked out after consideration a solitary plum so placed that you have to arrange certainly i have to arrange and the prince also if the effect for him is the same really i think not less and does he arrange mrs assingham asked to make up his arrears the question had risen to her lips it was as if another morsel on the dish had tempted her the sound of it struck her own ear immediately as giving out more of her thought than she had as yet intended but she quickly saw that she must follow it up at any risk with simplicity and that what was simplest was the ease of boldness make them up i mean by coming to see you charlotte replied however without as her friend would have phrased it turning a hair she shook her head but it was beautifully gentle he never comes oh said fanny assingham with which she felt a little stupid there it is he might so well you know otherwise otherwise and fanny was still vague it passed this time over her companion whose eyes wandering to a distance found themselves held the prince was at hand again the ambassador was still at his side they were stopped a moment by a uniformed personage a little old man of apparently the highest military character bristling with medals and orders this gave charlotte time to go on he has not been for three months and then as with her friend s last word in her ear otherwise yes he arranges otherwise and in my position she added i might too it s too absurd we shouldn t meet you ve met i gather said fanny assingham to night yes as far as that goes but what i mean is that i might placed for it as we both are go to see him and do you fanny asked with almost mistaken solemnity the perception of this excess made charlotte whether for gravity or for irony hang fire a minute i have been but that s nothing she said in itself and i tell you of it only to show you how our situation works it essentially becomes one a situation for both of us the prince s however is his own affair i meant but to speak of mine your situation s perfect mrs assingham presently declared i don t say it isn t taken in fact all round i think it is and i don t as i tell you complain of it the only thing is that i have to act as it demands of me to act said mrs assingham with an irrepressible quaver isn t it acting my dear to accept it i do accept it what do you want me to do less i want you to believe that you re a very fortunate person do you call that less charlotte asked with a smile from the point of view of my freedom i call it more let it take my position any name you like don t let it at any rate and mrs assingham s impatience prevailed at last over her presence of mind don t let it make you think too much of your freedom i don t know what you call too much for how can i not see it as it is you d see your own quickly enough if the colonel gave you the same liberty and i haven t to tell you with your so much greater knowledge of everything what it is that gives such liberty most for yourself personally of course charlotte went on you only know the state of neither needing it nor missing it your husband doesn t treat you as of less importance to him than some other woman ah don t talk to me of other women fanny now overtly panted do you call mr verver s perfectly natural interest in his daughter the greatest affection of which he is capable charlotte took it up in all readiness i do distinctly and in spite of my having done all i could think of to make him capable of a greater i ve done earnestly everything i could i ve made it month after month my study but i haven t succeeded it has been vividly brought home to me to night however she pursued i ve hoped against hope for i recognise that as i told you at the time i was duly warned and then as she met in her friend s face the absence of any such remembrance he did tell me that he wanted me just because i could be useful about her with which charlotte broke into a wonderful smile so you see i am it was on fanny assingham s lips for the moment to reply that this was on the contrary exactly what she didn t see she came in fact within an ace of saying you strike me as having quite failed to help his idea to work since by your account maggie has him not less but so much more on her mind how in the world with so much of a remedy comes there to remain so much of what was to be obviated but she saved herself in time conscious above all that she was in presence of still deeper things than she had yet dared to fear that there was more in it than any admission she had made represented and she had held herself familiar with admissions so that not to seem to understand where she couldn t accept and not to seem to accept where she couldn t approve and could still less with precipitation advise she invoked the mere appearance of casting no weight whatever into the scales of her young friend s consistency the only thing was that as she was quickly enough to feel she invoked it rather to excess it brought her her invocation too abruptly to her feet she brushed away everything i can t conceive my dear what you re talking about charlotte promptly rose then as might be to meet it and her colour for the first time perceptibly heightened she looked for the minute as her companion had looked as if twenty protests blocking each other s way had surged up within her but when charlotte had to make a selection her selection was always the most effective possible it was happy now above all for being made not in anger but in sorrow you give me up then give you up you forsake me at the hour of my life when it seems to me i most deserve a friend s loyalty if you do you re not just fanny you re even i think she went on rather cruel and it s least of all worthy of you to seem to wish to quarrel with me in order to cover your desertion she spoke at the same time with the noblest moderation of tone and the image of high pale lighted disappointment she meanwhile presented as of a creature patient and lonely in her splendour was an impression so firmly imposed that she could fill her measure to the brim and yet enjoy the last word as it is called in such cases with a perfection void of any vulgarity of triumph she merely completed for truth s sake her demonstration what is a quarrel with me but a quarrel with my right to recognise the conditions of my bargain but i can carry them out alone she said as she turned away she turned to meet the ambassador and the prince who their colloquy with their field marshal ended were now at hand and had already between them she was aware addressed her a remark that failed to penetrate the golden glow in which her intelligence was temporarily bathed she had made her point the point she had foreseen she must make she had made it thoroughly and once for all so that no more making was required and her success was reflected in the faces of the two men of distinction before her unmistakably moved to admiration by her exceptional radiance she at first but watched this reflection taking no note of any less adequate form of it possibly presented by poor fanny poor fanny left to stare at her incurred score chalked up in so few strokes on the wall then she took in what the ambassador was saying in french what he was apparently repeating to her a desire for your presence madame has been expressed en tres haut lieu and i ve let myself in for the responsibility to say nothing of the honour of seeing as the most respectful of your friends that so august an impatience is not kept waiting the greatest possible personage had in short according to the odd formula of societies subject to the greatest personages possible sent for her and she asked in her surprise what in the world does he want to do to me only to know without looking that fanny s bewilderment was called to a still larger application and to hear the prince say with authority indeed with a certain prompt dryness you must go immediately it s a summons the ambassador using authority as well had already somehow possessed himself of her hand which he drew into his arm and she was further conscious as she went off with him that though still speaking for her benefit amerigo had turned to fanny assingham he would explain afterwards besides which she would understand for herself to fanny however he had laughed as a mark apparently that for this infallible friend no explanation at all would be necessary xv it may be recorded none the less that the prince was the next moment to see how little any such assumption was founded alone with him now mrs assingham was incorruptible they send for charlotte through you no my dear as you see through the ambassador ah but the ambassador and you for the last quarter of an hour have been for them as one he s your ambassador it may indeed be further mentioned that the more fanny looked at it the more she saw in it they ve connected her with you she s treated as your appendage oh my appendage the prince amusedly exclaimed cara mia what a name she s treated rather say as my ornament and my glory and it s so remarkable a case for a mother in law that you surely can t find fault with it you ve ornaments enough it seems to me as you ve certainly glories enough without her and she s not the least little bit mrs assingham observed your mother in law in such a matter a shade of difference is enormous she s no relation to you whatever and if she s known in high quarters but as going about with you then then she failed however as from positive intensity of vision then then what he asked with perfect good nature she had better in such a case not be known at all but i assure you i never just now so much as mentioned her do you suppose i asked them said the young man still amused if they didn t want to see her you surely don t need to be shown that charlotte speaks for herself that she does so above all on such an occasion as this and looking as she does to night how so looking can she pass unnoticed how can she not have success besides he added as she but watched his face letting him say what he would as if she wanted to see how he would say it besides there is always the fact that we re of the same connection of what is your word the same concern we re certainly not with the relation of our respective sposi simply formal acquaintances we re in the same boat and the prince smiled with a candour that added an accent to his emphasis fanny assingham was full of the special sense of his manner it caused her to turn for a moment s refuge to a corner of her general consciousness in which she could say to herself that she was glad she wasn t in love with such a man as with charlotte just before she was embarrassed by the difference between what she took in and what she could say what she felt and what she could show it only appears to me of great importance that now that you all seem more settled here charlotte should be known for any presentation any further circulation or introduction as in particular her husband s wife known in the least possible degree as anything else i don t know what you mean by the same boat charlotte is naturally in mr verver s boat and pray am i not in mr verver s boat too why but for mr verver s boat i should have been by this time and his quick italian gesture an expressive direction and motion of his forefinger pointed to deepest depths away down down down she knew of course what he meant how it had taken his father in law s great fortune and taken no small slice to surround him with an element in which all too fatally weighted as he had originally been he could pecuniarily float and with this reminder other things came to her how strange it was that with all allowance for their merit it should befall some people to be so inordinately valued quoted as they said in the stock market so high and how still stranger perhaps that there should be cases in which for some reason one didn t mind the so frequently marked absence in them of the purpose really to represent their price she was thinking feeling at any rate for herself she was thinking that the pleasure she could take in this specimen of the class didn t suffer from his consent to be merely made buoyant partly because it was one of those pleasures he inspired them that by their nature couldn t suffer to whatever proof they were put and partly because besides he after all visibly had on his conscience some sort of return for services rendered he was a huge expense assuredly but it had been up to now her conviction that his idea was to behave beautifully enough to make the beauty well nigh an equivalent and that he had carried out his idea carried it out by continuing to lead the life to breathe the air very nearly to think the thoughts that best suited his wife and her father this she had till lately enjoyed the comfort of so distinctly perceiving as to have even been moved more than once to express to him the happiness it gave her he had that in his favour as against other matters yet it discouraged her too and rather oddly that he should so keep moving and be able to show her that he moved on the firm ground of the truth his acknowledgment of obligation was far from unimportant but she could find in his grasp of the real itself a kind of ominous intimation the intimation appeared to peep at her even out of his next word lightly as he produced it isn t it rather as if we had charlotte and i for bringing us together a benefactor in common and the effect for his interlocutress was still further to be deepened i somehow feel half the time as if he were her father in law too it s as if he had saved us both which is a fact in our lives or at any rate in our hearts to make of itself a link don t you remember he kept it up how the day she suddenly turned up for you just before my wedding we so frankly and funnily talked in her presence of the advisability for her of some good marriage and then as his friend s face in her extremity quite again as with charlotte but continued to fly the black flag of general repudiation well we really began then as it seems to me the work of placing her where she is we were wholly right and so was she that it was exactly the thing is shown by its success we recommended a good marriage at almost any price so to speak and taking us at our word she has made the very best that was really what we meant wasn t it only what she has got something thoroughly good it would be difficult it seems to me for her to have anything better once you allow her the way it s to be taken of course if you don t allow her that the case is different her offset is a certain decent freedom which i judge she ll be quite contented with you may say that will be very good of her but she strikes me as perfectly humble about it she proposes neither to claim it nor to use it with any sort of retentissement she would enjoy it i think quite as quietly as it might be given the boat you see the prince explained it no less considerately and lucidly is a good deal tied up at the dock or anchored if you like out in the stream i have to jump out from time to time to stretch my legs and you ll probably perceive if you give it your attention that charlotte really can t help occasionally doing the same it isn t even a question sometimes of one s getting to the dock one has to take a header and splash about in the water call our having remained here together to night call the accident of my having put them put our illustrious friends there on my companion s track for i grant you this as a practical result of our combination call the whole thing one of the harmless little plunges off the deck inevitable for each of us why not take them when they occur as inevitable and above all as not endangering life or limb we shan t drown we shan t sink at least i can answer for myself mrs verver too moreover do her the justice visibly knows how to swim he could easily go on for she didn t interrupt him fanny felt now that she wouldn t have interrupted him for the world she found his eloquence precious there was not a drop of it that she didn t in a manner catch as it came for immediate bottling for future preservation the crystal flask of her innermost attention really received it on the spot and she had even already the vision of how in the snug laboratory of her afterthought she should be able chemically to analyse it there were moments positively still beyond this when with the meeting of their eyes something as yet unnamable came out for her in his look when something strange and subtle and at variance with his words something that gave them away glimmered deep down as an appeal almost an incredible one to her finer comprehension what inconceivably was it like wasn t it however gross such a rendering of anything so occult fairly like a quintessential wink a hint of the possibility of their really treating their subject of course on some better occasion and thereby as well finding it much more interesting if this far red spark which might have been figured by her mind as the head light of an approaching train seen through the length of a tunnel was not on her side an ignis fatuus a mere subjective phenomenon it twinkled there at the direct expense of what the prince was inviting her to understand meanwhile too however and unmistakably the real treatment of their subject did at a given moment sound this was when he proceeded with just the same perfect possession of his thought on the manner of which he couldn t have improved to complete his successful simile by another in fact by just the supreme touch the touch for which it had till now been waiting for mrs verver to be known to people so intensely and exclusively as her husband s wife something is wanted that you know they haven t exactly got he should manage to be known or at least to be seen a little more as his wife s husband you surely must by this time have seen for yourself that he has his own habits and his own ways and that he makes more and more as of course he has a perfect right to do his own discriminations he s so perfect so ideal a father and doubtless largely by that very fact a generous a comfortable an admirable father in law that i should really feel it base to avail myself of any standpoint whatever to criticise him to you nevertheless i may make just one remark for you re not stupid you always understand so blessedly what one means he paused an instant as if even this one remark might be difficult for him should she give no sign of encouraging him to produce it nothing would have induced her however to encourage him she was now conscious of having never in her life stood so still or sat inwardly as it were so tight she felt like the horse of the adage brought and brought by her own fault to the water but strong for the occasion in the one fact that she couldn t be forced to drink invited in other words to understand she held her breath for fear of showing she did and this for the excellent reason that she was at last fairly afraid to it was sharp for her at the same time that she was certain in advance of his remark that she heard it before it had sounded that she already tasted in fine the bitterness it would have for her special sensibility but her companion from an inward and different need of his own was presently not deterred by her silence what i really don t see is why from his own point of view given that is his conditions so fortunate as they stood he should have wished to marry at all there it was then exactly what she knew would come and exactly for reasons that seemed now to thump at her heart as distressing to her yet she was resolved meanwhile not to suffer as they used to say of the martyrs then and there not to suffer odiously helplessly in public which could be prevented but by her breaking off with whatever inconsequence by her treating their discussion as ended and getting away she suddenly wanted to go home much as she had wanted an hour or two before to come she wanted to leave well behind her both her question and the couple in whom it had abruptly taken such vivid form but it was dreadful to have the appearance of disconcerted flight discussion had of itself to her sense become danger such light as from open crevices it let in and the overt recognition of danger was worse than anything else the worst in fact came while she was thinking how she could retreat and still not overtly recognise her face had betrayed her trouble and with that she was lost i m afraid however the prince said that i for some reason distress you for which i beg your pardon we ve always talked so well together it has been from the beginning the greatest pull for me nothing so much as such a tone could have quickened her collapse she felt he had her now at his mercy and he showed as he went on that he knew it we shall talk again all the same better than ever i depend on it too much don t you remember what i told you so definitely one day before my marriage that moving as i did in so many ways among new things mysteries conditions expectations assumptions different from any i had known i looked to you as my original sponsor my fairy godmother to see me through i beg you to believe he added that i look to you yet his very insistence had fortunately the next moment affected her as bringing her help with which at least she could hold up her head to speak ah you are through you were through long ago or if you aren t you ought to be well then if i ought to be it s all the more reason why you should continue to help me because very distinctly i assure you i m not the new things or ever so many of them are still for me new things the mysteries and expectations and assumptions still contain an immense element that i ve failed to puzzle out as we ve happened so luckily to find ourselves again really taking hold together you must let me as soon as possible come to see you you must give me a good kind hour if you refuse it me and he addressed himself to her continued reserve i shall feel that you deny with a stony stare your responsibility at this as from a sudden shake her reserve proved an inadequate vessel she could bear her own her private reference to the weight on her mind but the touch of another hand made it too horribly press oh i deny responsibility to you so far as i ever had it i ve done with it he had been all the while beautifully smiling but she made his look now penetrate her again more as to whom then do you confess it ah mio caro that s if to anyone my own business he continued to look at her hard you give me up then it was what charlotte had asked her ten minutes before and its coming from him so much in the same way shook her in her place she was on the point of replying do you and she agree together for what you ll say to me but she was glad afterwards to have checked herself in time little as her actual answer had perhaps bettered it i think i don t know what to make of you you must receive me at least he said oh please not till i m ready for you and though she found a laugh for it she had to turn away she had never turned away from him before and it was quite positively for her as if she were altogether afraid of him xvi later on when their hired brougham had with the long vociferation that tormented her impatience been extricated from the endless rank she rolled into the london night beside her husband as into a sheltering darkness where she could muffle herself and draw breath she had stood for the previous half hour in a merciless glare beaten upon stared out of countenance it fairly seemed to her by intimations of her mistake for what she was most immediately feeling was that she had in the past been active for these people to ends that were now bearing fruit and that might yet bear a larger crop she but brooded at first in her corner of the carriage it was like burying her exposed face a face too helplessly exposed in the cool lap of the common indifference of the dispeopled streets of the closed shops and darkened houses seen through the window of the brougham a world mercifully unconscious and unreproachful it wouldn t like the world she had just left know sooner or later what she had done or would know it at least only if the final consequence should be some quite overwhelming publicity she fixed this possibility itself so hard however for a few moments that the misery of her fear produced the next minute a reaction and when the carriage happened while it grazed a turn to catch the straight shaft from the lamp of a policeman in the act of playing his inquisitive flash over an opposite house front she let herself wince at being thus incriminated only that she might protest not less quickly against mere blind terror it had become for the occasion preposterously terror of which she must shake herself free before she could properly measure her ground the perception of this necessity had in truth soon aided her since she found on trying that lurid as her prospect might hover there she could none the less give it no name the sense of seeing was strong in her but she clutched at the comfort of not being sure of what she saw not to know what it would represent on a longer view was a help in turn to not making out that her hands were embrued since if she had stood in the position of a producing cause she should surely be less vague about what she had produced this further in its way was a step toward reflecting that when one s connection with any matter was too indirect to be traced it might be described also as too slight to be deplored by the time they were nearing cadogan place she had in fact recognised that she couldn t be as curious as she desired without arriving at some conviction of her being as innocent but there had been a moment in the dim desert of eaton square when she broke into speech it s only their defending themselves so much more than they need it s only that that makes me wonder it s their having so remarkably much to say for themselves her husband had as usual lighted his cigar remaining apparently as busy with it as she with her agitation you mean it makes you feel that you have nothing to which as she made no answer the colonel added what in the world did you ever suppose was going to happen the man s in a position in which he has nothing in life to do her silence seemed to characterise this statement as superficial and her thoughts as always in her husband s company pursued an independent course he made her when they were together talk but as if for some other person who was in fact for the most part herself yet she addressed herself with him as she could never have done without him he has behaved beautifully he did from the first i ve thought it all along wonderful of him and i ve more than once when i ve had a chance told him so therefore therefore but it died away as she mused therefore he has a right for a change to kick up his heels it isn t a question of course however she undivertedly went on of their behaving beautifully apart it s a question of their doing as they should when together which is another matter and how do you think then the colonel asked with interest that when together they should do the less they do one would say the better if you see so much in it his wife at this appeared to hear him i don t see in it what you d see and don t my dear she further answered think it necessary to be horrid or low about them they re the last people really to make anything of that sort come in right i m surely never horrid or low he returned about anyone but my extravagant wife i can do with all our friends as i see them myself what i can t do with is the figures you make of them and when you take to adding your figures up but he exhaled it again in smoke my additions don t matter when you ve not to pay the bill with which her meditation again bore her through the air the great thing was that when it so suddenly came up for her he wasn t afraid if he had been afraid he could perfectly have prevented it and if i had seen he was if i hadn t seen he wasn t so said mrs assingham could i so she declared would i it s perfectly true she went on it was too good a thing for her such a chance in life not to be accepted and i liked his not keeping her out of it merely from a fear of his own nature it was so wonderful it should come to her the only thing would have been if charlotte herself couldn t have faced it then if she had not had confidence we might have talked but she had it to any amount did you ask her how much bob assingham patiently inquired he had put the question with no more than his usual modest hope of reward but he had pressed this time the sharpest spring of response never never it wasn t a time to ask asking is suggesting and it wasn t a time to suggest one had to make up one s mind as quietly as possible by what one could judge and i judge as i say that charlotte felt she could face it for which she struck me at the time as for so proud a creature almost touchingly grateful the thing i should never forgive her for would be her forgetting to whom it is her thanks have remained most due that is to mrs assingham she said nothing for a little there were after all alternatives maggie herself of course astonishing little maggie is maggie then astonishing too and he gloomed out of his window his wife on her side now as they rolled projected the same look i m not sure that i don t begin to see more in her than dear little person as i ve always thought i ever supposed there was i m not sure that putting a good many things together i m not beginning to make her out rather extraordinary you certainly will if you can the colonel resignedly remarked again his companion said nothing then again she broke out in fact i do begin to feel it maggie s the great comfort i m getting hold of it it will be she who ll see us through in fact she ll have to and she ll be able touch by touch her meditation had completed it but with a cumulative effect for her husband s general sense of her method that caused him to overflow whimsically enough in his corner into an ejaculation now frequent on his lips for the relief that especially in communion like the present it gave him and that fanny had critically traced to the quaint example the aboriginal homeliness still so delightful of mr verver oh lordy lordy if she is however mrs assingham continued she ll be extraordinary enough and that s what i m thinking of but i m not indeed so very sure she added of the person to whom charlotte ought in decency to be most grateful i mean i m not sure if that person is even almost the incredible little idealist who has made her his wife i shouldn t think you would be love the colonel with some promptness responded charlotte as the wife of an incredible little idealist his cigar in short once more could alone express it yet what is that when one thinks but just what she struck one as more or less persuaded that she herself was really going to be this memory for the full view fanny found herself also invoking it made her companion in truth slightly gape an incredible little idealist charlotte herself and she was sincere his wife simply proceeded she was unmistakably sincere the question is only how much is left of it and that i see happens to be another of the questions you can t ask her you have to do it all said bob assingham as if you were playing some game with its rules drawn up though who s to come down on you if you break them i don t quite see or must you do it in three guesses like forfeits on christmas eve to which as his ribaldry but dropped from her he further added how much of anything will have to be left for you to be able to go on with it i shall go on fanny assingham a trifle grimly declared while there s a scrap as big as your nail but we re not yet luckily reduced only to that she had another pause holding the while the thread of that larger perception into which her view of mrs verver s obligation to maggie had suddenly expanded even if her debt was not to the others even then it ought to be quite sufficiently to the prince himself to keep her straight for what really did the prince do she asked herself but generously trust her what did he do but take it from her that if she felt herself willing it was because she felt herself strong that creates for her upon my word mrs assingham pursued a duty of considering him of honourably repaying his trust which well which she ll be really a fiend if she doesn t make the law of her conduct i mean of course his trust that she wouldn t interfere with him expressed by his holding himself quiet at the critical time the brougham was nearing home and it was perhaps this sense of ebbing opportunity that caused the colonel s next meditation to flower in a fashion almost surprising to his wife they were united for the most part but by his exhausted patience so that indulgent despair was generally at the best his note he at present however actually compromised with his despair to the extent of practically admitting that he had followed her steps he literally asked in short an intelligent well nigh a sympathising question gratitude to the prince for not having put a spoke in her wheel that you mean should taking it in the right way be precisely the ballast of her boat taking it in the right way fanny catching at this gleam emphasised the proviso but doesn t it rather depend on what she may most feel to be the right way no it depends on nothing because there s only one way for duty or delicacy oh delicacy bob assingham rather crudely murmured i mean the highest kind moral charlotte s perfectly capable of appreciating that by every dictate of moral delicacy she must let him alone then you ve made up your mind it s all poor charlotte he asked with an effect of abruptness the effect whether intended or not reached her brought her face short round it was a touch at which she again lost her balance at which somehow the bottom dropped out of her recovered comfort then you ve made up yours differently it really struck you that there is something the movement itself apparently made him once more stand off he had felt on his nearer approach the high temperature of the question perhaps that s just what she s doing showing him how much she s letting him alone pointing it out to him from day to day did she point it out by waiting for him to night on the stair case in the manner you described to me i really my dear described to you a manner the colonel clearly from want of habit scarce recognised himself in the imputation yes for once in a way in those few words we had after you had watched them come up you told me something of what you had seen you didn t tell me very much that you couldn t for your life but i saw for myself that strange to say you had received your impression and i felt therefore that there must indeed have been something out of the way for you so to betray it she was fully upon him now and she confronted him with his proved sensibility to the occasion confronted him because of her own uneasy need to profit by it it came over her still more than at the time it came over her that he had been struck with something even he poor dear man and that for this to have occurred there must have been much to be struck with she tried in fact to corner him to pack him insistently down in the truth of his plain vision the very plainness of which was its value for so recorded she felt none of it would escape she should have it at hand for reference come my dear you thought what you thought in the presence of what you saw you couldn t resist thinking i don t ask more of it than that and your idea is worth this time quite as much as any of mine so that you can t pretend as usual that mine has run away with me i haven t caught up with you i stay where i am but i see she concluded where you are and i m much obliged to you for letting me you give me a point de repere outside myself which is where i like it now i can work round you their conveyance as she spoke stopped at their door and it was on the spot another fact of value for her that her husband though seated on the side by which they must alight made no movement they were in a high degree votaries of the latch key so that their household had gone to bed and as they were unaccompanied by a footman the coachman waited in peace it was so indeed that for a minute bob assingham waited conscious of a reason for replying to this address otherwise than by the so obvious method of turning his back he didn t turn his face but he stared straight before him and his wife had already perceived in the fact of his not moving all the proof she could desire proof that is of her own contention she knew he never cared what she said and his neglect of his chance to show it was thereby the more eloquent leave it he at last remarked to them leave it she wondered let them alone they ll manage they ll manage you mean to do everything they want ah there then you are they ll manage in their own way the colonel almost cryptically repeated it had its effect for her quite apart from its light on the familiar phenomenon of her husband s indurated conscience it gave her full in her face the particular evocation of which she had made him guilty it was wonderful truly then the evocation so cleverly that s your idea that no one will be the wiser it s your idea that we shall have done all that s required of us if we simply protect them the colonel still in his place declined however to be drawn into a statement of his idea statements were too much like theories in which one lost one s way he only knew what he said and what he said represented the limited vibration of which his confirmed old toughness had been capable still none the less he had his point to make for which he took another instant but he made it for the third time in the same fashion they ll manage in their own way with which he got out oh yes at this for his companion it had indeed its effect and while he mounted their steps she but stared without following him at his opening of their door their hall was lighted and as he stood in the aperture looking back at her his tall lean figure outlined in darkness and with his crush hat according to his wont worn cavalierly rather diabolically askew he seemed to prolong the sinister emphasis of his meaning in general on these returns he came back for her when he had prepared their entrance so that it was now as if he were ashamed to face her in closer quarters he looked at her across the interval and still in her seat weighing his charge she felt her whole view of everything flare up wasn t it simply what had been written in the prince s own face beneath what he was saying didn t it correspond with the mocking presence there that she had had her troubled glimpse of wasn t in fine the pledge that they would manage in their own way the thing he had been feeling for his chance to invite her to take from him her husband s tone somehow fitted amerigo s look the one that had for her so strangely peeped from behind over the shoulder of the one in front she had not then read it but wasn t she reading it when she now saw in it his surmise that she was perhaps to be squared she wasn t to be squared and while she heard her companion call across to her well what s the matter she also took time to remind herself that she had decided she couldn t be frightened the matter why it was sufficiently the matter with all this that she felt a little sick for it was not the prince that she had been prepared to regard as primarily the shaky one shakiness in charlotte she had at the most perhaps postulated it would be she somehow felt more easy to deal with therefore if he had come so far it was a different pair of sleeves there was nothing to choose between them it made her so helpless that as the time passed without her alighting the colonel came back and fairly drew her forth after which on the pavement under the street lamp their very silence might have been the mark of something grave their silence eked out for her by his giving her his arm and their then crawling up their steps quite mildly and unitedly together like some old darby and joan who have had a disappointment it almost resembled a return from a funeral unless indeed it resembled more the hushed approach to a house of mourning what indeed had she come home for but to bury as decently as possible her mistake xvii it appeared thus that they might enjoy together extraordinary freedom the two friends from the moment they should understand their position aright with the prince himself from an early stage not unnaturally charlotte had made a great point of their so understanding it she had found frequent occasion to describe to him this necessity and her resignation tempered or her intelligence at least quickened by irrepressible irony she applied at different times different names to the propriety of their case the wonderful thing was that her sense of propriety had been from the first especially alive about it there were hours when she spoke of their taking refuge in what she called the commonest tact as if this principle alone would suffice to light their way there were others when it might have seemed to listen to her that their course would demand of them the most anxious study and the most independent not to say original interpretation of signs she talked now as if it were indicated at every turn by finger posts of almost ridiculous prominence she talked again as if it lurked in devious ways and were to be tracked through bush and briar and she even on occasion delivered herself in the sense that as their situation was unprecedented so their heaven was without stars do she once had echoed to him as the upshot of passages covertly though briefly occurring between them on her return from the visit to america that had immediately succeeded her marriage determined for her by this event as promptly as an excursion of the like strange order had been prescribed in his own case isn t the immense the really quite matchless beauty of our position that we have to do nothing in life at all nothing except the usual necessary everyday thing which consists in one s not being more of a fool than one can help that s all but that s as true for one time as for another there has been plenty of doing and there will doubtless be plenty still but it s all theirs every inch of it it s all a matter of what they ve done to us and she showed how the question had therefore been only of their taking everything as everything came and all as quietly as might be nothing stranger surely had ever happened to a conscientious a well meaning a perfectly passive pair no more extraordinary decree had ever been launched against such victims than this of forcing them against their will into a relation of mutual close contact that they had done everything to avoid she was to remember not a little meanwhile the particular prolonged silent look with which the prince had met her allusion to these primary efforts at escape she was inwardly to dwell on the element of the unuttered that her tone had caused to play up into his irresistible eyes and this because she considered with pride and joy that she had on the spot disposed of the doubt the question the challenge or whatever else might have been that such a look could convey he had been sufficiently off his guard to show some little wonder as to their having plotted so very hard against their destiny and she knew well enough of course what in this connection was at the bottom of his thought and what would have sounded out more or less if he had not happily saved himself from words all men were brutes enough to catch when they might at such chances for dissent for all the good it really did them but the prince s distinction was in being one of the few who could check himself before acting on the impulse this obviously was what counted in a man as delicacy if her friend had blurted or bungled he would have said in his simplicity did we do everything to avoid it when we faced your remarkable marriage quite handsomely of course using the plural taking his share of the case by way of a tribute of memory to the telegram she had received from him in paris after mr verver had despatched to rome the news of their engagement that telegram that acceptance of the prospect proposed to them an acceptance quite other than perfunctory she had never destroyed though reserved for no eyes but her own it was still carefully reserved she kept it in a safe place from which very privately she sometimes took it out to read it over a la guerre comme a la guerre then it had been couched in the french tongue we must lead our lives as we see them but i am charmed with your courage and almost surprised at my own the message had remained ambiguous she had read it in more lights than one it might mean that even without her his career was up hill work for him a daily fighting matter on behalf of a good appearance and that thus if they were to become neighbours again the event would compel him to live still more under arms it might mean on the other hand that he found he was happy enough and that accordingly so far as she might imagine herself a danger she was to think of him as prepared in advance as really seasoned and secure on his arrival in paris with his wife none the less she had asked for no explanation just as he himself had not asked if the document were still in her possession such an inquiry everything implied was beneath him just as it was beneath herself to mention to him uninvited that she had instantly offered and in perfect honesty to show the telegram to mr verver and that if this companion had but said the word she would immediately have put it before him she had thereby forborne to call his attention to her consciousness that such an exposure would in all probability straightway have dished her marriage that all her future had in fact for the moment hung by the single hair of mr verver s delicacy as she supposed they must call it and that her position in the matter of responsibility was therefore inattackably straight for the prince himself meanwhile time in its measured allowance had originally much helped him helped him in the sense of there not being enough of it to trip him up in spite of which it was just this accessory element that seemed at present with wonders of patience to lie in wait time had begotten at first more than anything else separations delays and intervals but it was troublesomely less of an aid from the moment it began so to abound that he had to meet the question of what to do with it less of it was required for the state of being married than he had on the whole expected less strangely for the state of being married even as he was married and there was a logic in the matter he knew a logic that but gave this truth a sort of solidity of evidence mr verver decidedly helped him with it with his wedded condition helped him really so much that it made all the difference in the degree in which he rendered it the service on mr verver s part was remarkable as indeed what service from the first of their meeting had not been he was living he had been living these four or five years on mr verver s services a truth scarcely less plain if he dealt with them for appreciation one by one than if he poured them all together into the general pot of his gratitude and let the thing simmer to a nourishing broth to the latter way with them he was undoubtedly most disposed yet he would even thus on occasion pick out a piece to taste on its own merits wondrous at such hours could seem the savour of the particular treat at his father in law s expense that he more and more struck himself as enjoying he had needed months and months to arrive at a full appreciation he couldn t originally have given offhand a name to his deepest obligation but by the time the name had flowered in his mind he was practically living at the ease guaranteed him mr verver then in a word took care of his relation to maggie as he took care and apparently always would of everything else he relieved him of all anxiety about his married life in the same manner in which he relieved him on the score of his bank account and as he performed the latter office by communicating with the bankers so the former sprang as directly from his good understanding with his daughter this understanding had wonderfully that was in high evidence the same deep intimacy as the commercial the financial association founded far down on a community of interest and the correspondence for the prince carried itself out in identities of character the vision of which fortunately rather tended to amuse than to as might have happened irritate him those people and his free synthesis lumped together capitalists and bankers retired men of business illustrious collectors american fathers in law american fathers little american daughters little american wives those people were of the same large lucky group as one might say they were all at least of the same general species and had the same general instincts they hung together they passed each other the word they spoke each other s language they did each other turns in this last connection it of course came up for our young man at a given moment that maggie s relation with him was also on the perceived basis taken care of which was in fact the real upshot of the matter it was a funny situation that is it was funny just as it stood their married life was in question but the solution was not less strikingly before them it was all right for himself because mr verver worked it so for maggie s comfort and it was all right for maggie because he worked it so for her husband s the fact that time however was not as we have said wholly on the prince s side might have shown for particularly true one dark day on which by an odd but not unprecedented chance the reflections just noted offered themselves as his main recreation they alone it appeared had been appointed to fill the hours for him and even to fill the great square house in portland place where the scale of one of the smaller saloons fitted them but loosely he had looked into this room on the chance that he might find the princess at tea but though the fireside service of the repast was shiningly present the mistress of the table was not and he had waited for her if waiting it could be called while he measured again and again the stretch of polished floor he could have named to himself no pressing reason for seeing her at this moment and her not coming in as the half hour elapsed became in fact quite positively however perversely the circumstance that kept him on the spot just there he might have been feeling just there he could best take his note this observation was certainly by itself meagre amusement for a dreary little crisis but his walk to and fro and in particular his repeated pause at one of the high front windows gave each of the ebbing minutes none the less after a time a little more of the quality of a quickened throb of the spirit these throbs scarce expressed however the impatience of desire any more than they stood for sharp disappointment the series together resembled perhaps more than anything else those fine waves of clearness through which for a watcher of the east dawn at last trembles into rosy day the illumination indeed was all for the mind the prospect revealed by it a mere immensity of the world of thought the material outlook was all the while a different matter the march afternoon judged at the window had blundered back into autumn it had been raining for hours and the colour of the rain the colour of the air of the mud of the opposite houses of life altogether in so grim a joke so idiotic a masquerade was an unutterable dirty brown there was at first even for the young man no faint flush in the fact of the direction taken while he happened to look out by a slow jogging four wheeled cab which awkwardly deflecting from the middle course at the apparent instance of a person within began to make for the left hand pavement and so at last under further instructions floundered to a full stop before the prince s windows the person within alighting with an easier motion proved to be a lady who left the vehicle to wait and putting up no umbrella quickly crossed the wet interval that separated her from the house she but flitted and disappeared yet the prince from his standpoint had had time to recognise her and the recognition kept him for some minutes motionless charlotte stant at such an hour in a shabby four wheeler and a waterproof charlotte stant turning up for him at the very climax of his special inner vision was an apparition charged with a congruity at which he stared almost as if it had been a violence the effect of her coming to see him him only had while he stood waiting a singular intensity though after some minutes had passed the certainty of this began to drop perhaps she had not come or had come only for maggie perhaps on learning below that the princess had not returned she was merely leaving a message writing a word on a card he should see at any rate and meanwhile controlling himself would do nothing this thought of not interfering took on a sudden force for him she would doubtless hear he was at home but he would let her visit to him be all of her own choosing and his view of a reason for leaving her free was the more remarkable that though taking no step he yet intensely hoped the harmony of her breaking into sight while the superficial conditions were so against her was a harmony with conditions that were far from superficial and that gave for his imagination an extraordinary value to her presence the value deepened strangely moreover with the rigour of his own attitude with the fact too that listening hard he neither heard the house door close again nor saw her go back to her cab and it had risen to a climax by the time he had become aware with his quickened sense that she had followed the butler up to the landing from which his room opened if anything could further then have added to it the renewed pause outside as if she had said to the man wait a moment would have constituted this touch yet when the man had shown her in had advanced to the tea table to light the lamp under the kettle and had then busied himself all deliberately with the fire she made it easy for her host to drop straight from any height of tension and to meet her provisionally on the question of maggie while the butler remained it was maggie that she had come to see and maggie that in spite of this attendant s high blankness on the subject of all possibilities on that lady s part she would cheerfully by the fire wait for as soon as they were alone together however she mounted as with the whizz and the red light of a rocket from the form to the fact saying straight out as she stood and looked at him what else my dear what in the world else can we do it was as if he then knew on the spot why he had been feeling for hours as he had felt as if he in fact knew within the minute things he had not known even while she was panting as from the effect of the staircase at the door of the room he knew at the same time none the less that she knew still more than he in the sense that is of all the signs and portents that might count for them and his vision of alternative she could scarce say what to call them solutions satisfactions opened out altogether with this tangible truth of her attitude by the chimney place the way she looked at him as through the gained advantage of it her right hand resting on the marble and her left keeping her skirt from the fire while she held out a foot to dry he couldn t have told what particular links and gaps had at the end of a few minutes found themselves renewed and bridged for he remembered no occasion in rome from which the picture could have been so exactly copied he remembered that is none of her coming to see him in the rain while a muddy four wheeler waited and while though having left her waterproof downstairs she was yet invested with the odd eloquence the positive picturesqueness yes given all the rest of the matter of a dull dress and a black bowdlerised hat that seemed to make a point of insisting on their time of life and their moral intention the hat s and the frock s own as well as on the irony of indifference to them practically playing in her so handsome rain freshened face the sense of the past revived for him nevertheless as it had not yet done it made that other time somehow meet the future close interlocking with it before his watching eyes as in a long embrace of arms and lips and so handling and hustling the present that this poor quantity scarce retained substance enough scarce remained sufficiently there to be wounded or shocked what had happened in short was that charlotte and he had by a single turn of the wrist of fate led up to indeed no doubt by steps and stages that conscious computation had missed been placed face to face in a freedom that partook extraordinarily of ideal perfection since the magic web had spun itself without their toil almost without their touch above all on this occasion once more there sounded through their safety as an undertone the very voice he had listened to on the eve of his marriage with such another sort of unrest dimly again and again from that period on he had seemed to hear it tell him why it kept recurring but it phrased the large music now in a way that filled the room the reason was into which he had lived quite intimately by the end of a quarter of an hour that just this truth of their safety offered it now a kind of unexampled receptacle letting it spread and spread but at the same time elastically enclosing it banking it in for softness as with billows of eiderdown on that morning in the park there had been however dissimulated doubt and danger whereas the tale this afternoon was taken up with a highly emphasised confidence the emphasis for their general comfort was what charlotte had come to apply inasmuch as though it was not what she definitely began with it had soon irrepressibly shaped itself it was the meaning of the question she had put to him as soon as they were alone even though indeed as from not quite understanding he had not then directly replied it was the meaning of everything else down to the conscious quaintness of her ricketty growler and the conscious humility of her dress it had helped him a little the question of these eccentricities to let her immediate appeal pass without an answer he could ask her instead what had become of her carriage and why above all she was not using it in such weather it s just because of the weather she explained it s my little idea it makes me feel as i used to when i could do as i liked xviii this came out so straight that he saw at once how much truth it expressed yet it was truth that still a little puzzled him but did you ever like knocking about in such discomfort it seems to me now that i then liked everything it s the charm at any rate she said from her place at the fire of trying again the old feelings they come back they come back everything she went on comes back besides she wound up you know for yourself he stood near her his hands in his pockets but not looking at her looking hard at the tea table ah i haven t your courage moreover he laughed it seems to me that so far as that goes i do live in hansoms but you must awfully want your tea he quickly added so let me give you a good stiff cup he busied himself with this care and she sat down on his pushing up a low seat where she had been standing so that while she talked he could bring her what she further desired he moved to and fro before her he helped himself and her visit as the moments passed had more and more the effect of a signal communication that she had come all responsibly and deliberately as on the clear show of the clock face of their situation to make the whole demonstration none the less presented itself as taking place at a very high level of debate in the cool upper air of the finer discrimination the deeper sincerity the larger philosophy no matter what were the facts invoked and arrayed it was only a question as yet of their seeing their way together to which indeed exactly the present occasion appeared to have so much to contribute it s not that you haven t my courage charlotte said but that you haven t i rather think my imagination unless indeed it should turn out after all she added that you haven t even my intelligence however i shall not be afraid of that till you ve given me more proof and she made again but more clearly her point of a moment before you knew besides you knew to day i would come and if you knew that you know everything so she pursued and if he didn t meanwhile if he didn t even at this take her up it might be that she was so positively fitting him again with the fair face of temporising kindness that he had given her to keep her eyes on at the other important juncture and the sense of which she might ever since have been carrying about with her like a precious medal not exactly blessed by the pope suspended round her neck she had come back however this might be to her immediate account of herself and no mention of their great previous passage was to rise to the lips of either above all she said there has been the personal romance of it of tea with me over the fire ah so far as that goes i don t think even my intelligence fails me oh it s further than that goes and if i ve had a better day than you it s perhaps when i come to think of it that i am braver you bore yourself you see but i don t i don t i don t she repeated it s precisely boring one s self without relief he protested that takes courage passive then not active my romance is that if you want to know i ve been all day on the town literally on the town isn t that what they call it i know how it feels after which as if breaking off and you have you never been out she asked he still stood there with his hands in his pockets what should i have gone out for oh what should people in our case do anything for but you re wonderful all of you you know how to live we re clumsy brutes we other s beside you we must always be doing something however charlotte pursued if you had gone out you might have missed the chance of me which i m sure though you won t confess it was what you didn t want and might have missed above all the satisfaction that look blank about it as you will i ve come to congratulate you on that s really what i can at last do you can t not know at least on such a day as this you can t not know she said where you are she waited as for him either to grant that he knew or to pretend that he didn t but he only drew a long deep breath which came out like a moan of impatience it brushed aside the question of where he was or what he knew it seemed to keep the ground clear for the question of his visitor herself that of charlotte verver exactly as she sat there so for some moments with their long look they but treated the matter in silence with the effect indeed by the end of the time of having considerably brought it on this was sufficiently marked in what charlotte next said there it all is extraordinary beyond words it makes such a relation for us as i verily believe was never before in the world thrust upon two well meaning creatures haven t we therefore to take things as we find them she put the question still more directly than that of a moment before but to this one as well he returned no immediate answer noticing only that she had finished her tea he relieved her of her cup carried it back to the table asked her what more she would have and then on her nothing thanks returned to the fire and restored a displaced log to position by a small but almost too effectual kick she had meanwhile got up again and it was on her feet that she repeated the words she had first frankly spoken what else can we do what in all the world else he took them up however no more than at first where then have you been he asked as from mere interest in her adventure everywhere i could think of except to see people i didn t want people i wanted too much to think but i ve been back at intervals three times and then come away again my cabman must think me crazy it s very amusing i shall owe him when we come to settle more money than he has ever seen i ve been my dear she went on to the british museum which you know i always adore and i ve been to the national gallery and to a dozen old booksellers coming across treasures and i ve lunched on some strange nastiness at a cookshop in holborn i wanted to go to the tower but it was too far my old man urged that and i would have gone to the zoo if it hadn t been too wet which he also begged me to observe but you wouldn t believe i did put in st paul s such days she wound up are expensive for besides the cab i ve bought quantities of books she immediately passed at any rate to another point i can t help wondering when you must last have laid eyes on them and then as it had apparently for her companion an effect of abruptness maggie i mean and the child for i suppose you know he s with her oh yes i know he s with her i saw them this morning and did they then announce their programme she told me she was taking him as usual da nonno and for the whole day he hesitated but it was as if his attitude had slowly shifted she didn t say and i didn t ask well she went on it can t have been later than half past ten i mean when you saw them they had got to eaton square before eleven you know we don t formally breakfast adam and i we have tea in our rooms at least i have but luncheon is early and i saw my husband this morning by twelve he was showing the child a picture book maggie had been there with them had left them settled together then she had gone out taking the carriage for something he had been intending but that she offered to do instead the prince appeared to confess at this to his interest taking you mean your carriage i don t know which and it doesn t matter it s not a question she smiled of a carriage the more or the less it s not a question even if you come to that of a cab it s so beautiful she said that it s not a question of anything vulgar or horrid which she gave him time to agree about and though he was silent it was rather remarkably as if he fell in i went out i wanted to i had my idea it seemed to me important it has been it is important i know as i haven t known before the way they feel i couldn t in any other way have made so sure of it they feel a confidence the prince observed he had indeed said it for her they feel a confidence and she proceeded with lucidity to the fuller illustration of it speaking again of the three different moments that in the course of her wild ramble had witnessed her return for curiosity and even really a little from anxiety to eaton square she was possessed of a latch key rarely used it had always irritated adam one of the few things that did to find servants standing up so inhumanly straight when they came home in the small hours after parties so i had but to slip in each time with my cab at the door and make out for myself without their knowing it that maggie was still there i came i went without their so much as dreaming what do they really suppose she asked becomes of one not so much sentimentally or morally so to call it and since that doesn t matter but even just physically materially as a mere wandering woman as a decent harmless wife after all as the best stepmother after all that really ever was or at the least simply as a maitresse de maison not quite without a conscience they must even in their odd way she declared have some idea oh they ve a great deal of idea said the prince and nothing was easier than to mention the quantity they think so much of us they think in particular so much of you ah don t put it all on me she smiled but he was putting it now where she had admirably prepared the place it s a matter of your known character ah thank you for known she still smiled it s a matter of your wonderful cleverness and wonderful charm it s a matter of what those things have done for you in the world i mean in this world and this place you re a personage for them and personages do go and come oh no my dear there you re quite wrong and she laughed now in the happier light they had diffused that s exactly what personages don t do they live in state and under constant consideration they haven t latch keys but drums and trumpets announce them and when they go out in growlers it makes a greater noise still it s you caro mio she said who so far as that goes are the personage ah he in turn protested don t put it all on me what at any rate when you get home he added shall you say that you ve been doing i shall say beautifully that i ve been here all day yes all day keeping you company in your solitude how can we understand anything she went on without really seeing that this is what they must like to think i do for you just as quite as comfortably you do it for me the thing is for us to learn to take them as they are he considered this a while in his restless way but with his eyes not turning from her after which rather disconnectedly though very vehemently he brought out how can i not feel more than anything else how they adore together my boy and then further as if slightly disconcerted she had nothing to meet this and he quickly perceived the effect they would have done the same for one of yours ah if i could have had one i hoped and i believed said charlotte that that would happen it would have been better it would have made perhaps some difference he thought so too poor duck that it might have been i m sure he hoped and intended so it s not at any rate she went on my fault there it is she had uttered these statements one by one gravely sadly and responsibly owing it to her friend to be clear she paused briefly but as if once for all she made her clearness complete and now i m too sure it will never be he waited for a moment never never they treated the matter not exactly with solemnity but with a certain decency even perhaps urgency of distinctness it would probably have been better charlotte added but things turn out and it leaves us she made the point more alone he seemed to wonder it leaves you more alone oh she again returned don t put it all on me maggie would have given herself to his child i m sure scarcely less than he gives himself to yours it would have taken more than any child of mine she explained it would have taken more than ten children of mine could i have had them to keep our sposi apart she smiled as for the breadth of the image but as he seemed to take it in spite of this for important she then spoke gravely enough it s as strange as you like but we re immensely alone he kept vaguely moving but there were moments when again with an awkward ease and his hands in his pockets he was more directly before her he stood there at these last words which had the effect of making him for a little throw back his head and as thinking something out stare up at the ceiling what will you say she meanwhile asked that you ve been doing this brought his consciousness and his eyes back to her and she pointed her question i mean when she comes in for i suppose she will some time come in it seems to me we must say the same thing well he thought again yet i can scarce pretend to have had what i haven t ah what haven t you had what aren t you having her question rang out as they lingered face to face and he still took it before he answered from her eyes we must at least then not to be absurd together do the same thing we must act it would really seem in concert it would really seem her eyebrows her shoulders went up quite in gaiety as for the relief this brought her it s all in the world i pretend we must act in concert heaven knows she said they do so it was that he evidently saw and that by his admission the case could fairly be put but what he evidently saw appeared to come over him at the same time as too much for him so that he fell back suddenly to ground where she was not awaiting him the difficulty is and will always be that i don t understand them i didn t at first but i thought i should learn to that was what i hoped and it appeared then that fanny assingham might help me oh fanny assingham said charlotte verver he stared a moment at her tone she would do anything for us to which charlotte at first said nothing as if from the sense of too much then indulgently enough she shook her head we re beyond her he thought a moment as of where this placed them she d do anything then for them well so would we so that doesn t help us she has broken down she doesn t understand us and really my dear charlotte added fanny assingham doesn t matter he wondered again unless as taking care of them ah charlotte instantly said isn t it for us only to do that she spoke as with a flare of pride for their privilege and their duty i think we want no one s aid she spoke indeed with a nobleness not the less effective for coming in so oddly with a sincerity visible even through the complicated twist by which any effort to protect the father and the daughter seemed necessarily conditioned for them it moved him in any case as if some spring of his own a weaker one had suddenly been broken by it these things all the while the privilege the duty the opportunity had been the substance of his own vision they formed the note he had been keeping back to show her that he was not in their so special situation without a responsible view a conception that he could name and could act on was something that now at last not to be too eminent a fool he was required by all the graces to produce and the luminous idea she had herself uttered would have been his expression of it she had anticipated him but as her expression left for positive beauty nothing to be desired he felt rather righted than wronged a large response as he looked at her came into his face a light of excited perception all his own in the glory of which as it almost might be called what he gave her back had the value of what she had given him they re extraordinarily happy oh charlotte s measure of it was only too full beatifically that s the great thing he went on so that it doesn t matter really that one doesn t understand besides you do enough i understand my husband perhaps she after an instant conceded i don t understand your wife you re of the same race at any rate more or less of the same general tradition and education of the same moral paste there are things you have in common with them but i on my side as i ve gone on trying to see if i haven t some of these things too i on my side have more and more failed there seem at last to be none worth mentioning i can t help seeing it i m decidedly too different yet you re not charlotte made the important point too different from me i don t know as we re not married that brings things out perhaps if we were he said you would find some abyss of divergence since it depends on that then she smiled i m safe as you are anyhow moreover as one has so often had occasion to feel and even to remark they re very very simple that makes she added a difficulty for belief but when once one has taken it in it makes less difficulty for action i have at last for myself i think taken it in i m not afraid he wondered a moment not afraid of what well generally of some beastly mistake especially of any mistake founded on one s idea of their difference for that idea charlotte developed positively makes one so tender ah but rather well then there it is i can t put myself into maggie s skin i can t as i say it s not my fit i shouldn t be able as i see it to breathe in it but i can feel that i d do anything to shield it from a bruise tender as i am for her too she went on i think i m still more so for my husband he s in truth of a sweet simplicity the prince turned over a while the sweet simplicity of mr verver well i don t know that i can choose at night all cats are grey i only see how for so many reasons we ought to stand toward them and how to do ourselves justice we do it represents for us a conscious care of every hour literally said charlotte she could rise to the highest measure of the facts and for which we must trust each other oh as we trust the saints in glory fortunately the prince hastened to add we can with which as for the full assurance and the pledge it involved their hands instinctively found their hands it s all too wonderful firmly and gravely she kept his hand it s too beautiful and so for a minute they stood together as strongly held and as closely confronted as any hour of their easier past even had seen them they were silent at first only facing and faced only grasping and grasped only meeting and met it s sacred he said at last it s sacred she breathed back to him they vowed it gave it out and took it in drawn by their intensity more closely together then of a sudden through this tightened circle as at the issue of a narrow strait into the sea beyond everything broke up broke down gave way melted and mingled their lips sought their lips their pressure their response and their response their pressure with a violence that had sighed itself the next moment to the longest and deepest of stillnesses they passionately sealed their pledge xix he had taken it from her as we have seen moreover that fanny assingham didn t now matter the now he had even himself supplied as no more than fair to his sense of various earlier stages and though his assent remained scarce more than tacit his behaviour for the hour so fell into line that for many days he kept postponing the visit he had promised his old friend on the occasion of their talk at the foreign office with regret none the less would he have seen it quite extinguished that theory of their relation as attached pupil and kind instructress in which they had from the first almost equally found a convenience it had been he no doubt who had most put it forward since his need of knowledge fairly exceeded her mild pretension but he had again and again repeated to her that he should never without her have been where he was and she had not successfully concealed the pleasure it might give her to believe it even after the question of where he was had begun to show itself as rather more closed than open to interpretation it had never indeed before that evening come up as during the passage at the official party and he had for the first time at those moments a little disappointedly got the impression of a certain failure on the dear woman s part of something he was aware of having always rather freely taken for granted in her of what exactly the failure consisted he would still perhaps have felt it a little harsh to try to say and if she had in fact as by charlotte s observation broken down the details of the collapse would be comparatively unimportant they came to the same thing all such collapses the failure of courage the failure of friendship or the failure just simply of tact for didn t any one of them by itself amount really to the failure of wit which was the last thing he had expected of her and which would be but another name for the triumph of stupidity it had been charlotte s remark that they were at last beyond her whereas he had ever enjoyed believing that a certain easy imagination in her would keep up with him to the end he shrank from affixing a label to mrs assingham s want of faith but when he thought at his ease of the way persons who were capable really entertained or at least with any refinement the passion of personal loyalty he figured for them a play of fancy neither timorous nor scrupulous so would his personal loyalty if need be have accepted the adventure for the good creature herself to that definite degree that he had positively almost missed the luxury of some such call from her that was what it all came back to again with these people among whom he was married that one found one used one s imagination mainly for wondering how they contrived so little to appeal to it he felt at moments as if there were never anything to do for them that was worthy to call worthy of the personal relation never any charming charge to take of any confidence deeply reposed he might vulgarly have put it that one had never to plot or to lie for them he might humourously have put it that one had never as by the higher conformity to lie in wait with the dagger or to prepare insidiously the cup these were the services that by all romantic tradition were consecrated to affection quite as much as to hate but he could amuse himself with saying so far as the amusement went that they were what he had once for all turned his back on fanny was meanwhile frequent it appeared in eaton square so much he gathered from the visitor who was not infrequent least of all at tea time during the same period in portland place though they had little need to talk of her after practically agreeing that they had outlived her to the scene of these conversations and suppressions mrs assingham herself made actually no approach her latest view of her utility seeming to be that it had found in eaton square its most urgent field it was finding there in fact everything and everyone but the prince who mostly just now kept away or who at all events on the interspaced occasions of his calling happened not to encounter the only person from whom he was a little estranged it would have been all prodigious if he had not already with charlotte s aid so very considerably lived into it it would have been all indescribably remarkable this fact that with wonderful causes for it so operating on the surface nobody else as yet in the combination seemed estranged from anybody if mrs assingham delighted in maggie she knew by this time how most easily to reach her and if she was unhappy about charlotte she knew by the same reasoning how most probably to miss that vision of her on which affliction would feed it might feed of course on finding her so absent from her home just as this particular phenomenon of her domestic detachment could be by the anxious mind best studied there fanny was however for her reasons shy of portland place itself this was appreciable so that she might well after all have no great light on the question of whether charlotte s appearances there were frequent or not any more than on that of the account they might be keeping of the usual solitude since it came to this of the head of that house there was always to cover all ambiguities to constitute a fund of explanation for the divisions of mrs verver s day the circumstance that at the point they had all reached together mrs verver was definitely and by general acclamation in charge of the social relations of the family literally of those of the two households as to her genius for representing which in the great world and in the grand style vivid evidence had more and more accumulated it had been established in the two households at an early stage and with the highest good humour that charlotte was a was the social success whereas the princess though kind though punctilious though charming though in fact the dearest little creature in the world and the princess into the bargain was distinctly not would distinctly never be and might as well practically give it up whether through being above it or below it too much outside of it or too much lost in it too unequipped or too indisposed didn t especially matter what sufficed was that the whole thing call it appetite or call it patience the act of representation at large and the daily business of intercourse fell in with charlotte s tested facility and not much less visibly with her accommodating her generous view of her domestic use she had come frankly into the connection to do and to be what she could no questions asked and she had taken over accordingly as it stood and in the finest practical spirit the burden of a visiting list that maggie originally left to herself and left even more to the principino had suffered to get inordinately out of hand she had in a word not only mounted cheerfully the london treadmill she had handsomely professed herself for the further comfort of the three others sustained in the effort by a frivolous side if that were not too harsh a name for a pleasant constitutional curiosity there were possibilities of dulness ponderosities of practice arid social sands the bad quarters of an hour that turned up like false pieces in a debased currency of which she made on principle very nearly as light as if she had not been clever enough to distinguish the prince had on this score paid her his compliment soon after her return from her wedding tour in america where by all accounts she had wondrously borne the brunt facing brightly at her husband s side everything that came up and what had come often was beyond words just as precisely with her own interest only at stake she had thrown up the game during the visit paid before her marriage the discussion of the american world the comparison of notes impressions and adventures had been all at hand as a ground of meeting for mrs verver and her husband s son in law from the hour of the reunion of the two couples thus it had been in short that charlotte could for her friend s appreciation so promptly make her point even using expressions from which he let her see at the hour that he drew amusement of his own what could be more simple than one s going through with everything she had asked when it s so plain a part of one s contract i ve got so much by my marriage for she had never for a moment concealed from him how much she had felt it and was finding it that i should deserve no charity if i stinted my return not to do that to give back on the contrary all one can are just one s decency and one s honour and one s virtue these things henceforth if you re interested to know are my rule of life the absolute little gods of my worship the holy images set up on the wall oh yes since i m not a brute she had wound up you shall see me as i am which was therefore as he had seen her dealing always from month to month from day to day and from one occasion to the other with the duties of a remunerated office her perfect her brilliant efficiency had doubtless all the while contributed immensely to the pleasant ease in which her husband and her husband s daughter were lapped it had in fact probably done something more than this it had given them a finer and sweeter view of the possible scope of that ease they had brought her in on the crudest expression of it to do the worldly for them and she had done it with such genius that they had themselves in consequence renounced it even more than they had originally intended in proportion as she did it moreover was she to be relieved of other and humbler doings which minor matters by the properest logic devolved therefore upon maggie in whose chords and whose province they more naturally lay not less naturally by the same token they included the repair at the hands of the latter young woman of every stitch conceivably dropped by charlotte in eaton square this was homely work but that was just what made it maggie s bearing in mind dear amerigo who was so much of her own great mundane feather and whom the homeliness in question didn t no doubt quite equally provide for that would be to balance just in a manner charlotte s very most charming function from the moment charlotte could be got adequately to recognise it well that charlotte might be appraised as at last not ineffectually recognising it was a reflection that during the days with which we are actually engaged completed in the prince s breast these others these images and ruminations of his leisure these gropings and fittings of his conscience and his experience that we have attempted to set in order there they bore him company not insufficiently considering in especial his fuller resources in that line while he worked out to the last lucidity the principle on which he forbore either to seek fanny out in cadogan place or to perpetrate the error of too marked an assiduity in eaton square this error would be his not availing himself to the utmost of the convenience of any artless theory of his constitution or of charlotte s that might prevail there that artless theories could and did prevail was a fact he had ended by accepting under copious evidence as definite and ultimate and it consorted with common prudence with the simplest economy of life not to be wasteful of any odd gleaning to haunt eaton square in fine would be to show that he had not like his brilliant associate a sufficiency of work in the world it was just his having that sufficiency it was just their having it together that so strangely and so blessedly made as they put it to each other everything possible what further propped up the case moreover was that the world by still another beautiful perversity of their chance included portland place without including to anything like the same extent eaton square the latter residence at the same time it must promptly be added did on occasion wake up to opportunity and as giving itself a frolic shake send out a score of invitations one of which fitful flights precisely had before easter the effect of disturbing a little our young man s measure of his margin maggie with a proper spirit held that her father ought from time to time to give a really considered dinner and mr verver who had as little idea as ever of not meeting expectation was of the harmonious opinion that his wife ought charlotte s own judgment was always that they were ideally free the proof of which would always be she maintained that everyone they feared they might most have alienated by neglect would arrive wreathed with smiles on the merest hint of a belated signal wreathed in smiles all round truly enough these apologetic banquets struck amerigo as being they were frankly touching occasions to him marked in the great london bousculade with a small still grace of their own an investing amenity and humanity everybody came everybody rushed but all succumbed to the soft influence and the brutality of mere multitude of curiosity without tenderness was put off at the foot of the fine staircase with the overcoats and shawls the entertainment offered a few evenings before easter and at which maggie and he were inevitably present as guests was a discharge of obligations not insistently incurred and had thereby possibly all the more the note of this almost arcadian optimism a large bright dull murmurous mild eyed middle aged dinner involving for the most part very bland though very exalted immensely announceable and hierarchically placeable couples and followed without the oppression of a later contingent by a brief instrumental concert over the preparation of which the prince knew maggie s anxiety had conferred with charlotte s ingenuity and both had supremely revelled as it were in mr verver s solvency the assinghams were there by prescription though quite at the foot of the social ladder and with the colonel s wife in spite of her humility of position the prince was more inwardly occupied than with any other person except charlotte he was occupied with charlotte because in the first place she looked so inordinately handsome and held so high where so much else was mature and sedate the torch of responsive youth and the standard of passive grace and because of the fact that in the second the occasion so far as it referred itself with any confidence of emphasis to a hostess seemed to refer itself preferentially well meaningly and perversely to maggie it was not indistinguishable to him when once they were all stationed that his wife too had in perfection her own little character but he wondered how it managed so visibly to simplify itself and this he knew in spite of any desire she entertained to the essential air of having overmuch on her mind the felicity and indeed the very conduct and credit of the feast he knew as well the other things of which her appearance was at any time and in eaton square especially made up her resemblance to her father at times so vivid and coming out in the delicate warmth of occasions like the quickened fragrance of a flower her resemblance as he had hit it off for her once in rome in the first flushed days after their engagement to a little dancing girl at rest ever so light of movement but most often panting gently even a shade compunctiously on a bench her approximation finally for it was analogy somehow more than identity to the transmitted images of rather neutral and negative propriety that made up in his long line the average of wifehood and motherhood if the roman matron had been in sufficiency first and last the honour of that line maggie would no doubt at fifty have expanded have solidified to some such dignity even should she suggest a little but a cornelia in miniature a light however broke for him in season and when once it had done so it made him more than ever aware of mrs verver s vaguely yet quite exquisitely contingent participation a mere hinted or tendered discretion in short of mrs verver s indescribable unfathomable relation to the scene her placed condition her natural seat and neighbourhood her intenser presence her quieter smile her fewer jewels were inevitably all as nothing compared with the preoccupation that burned in maggie like a small flame and that had in fact kindled in each of her cheeks a little attesting but fortunately by no means unbecoming spot the party was her father s party and its greater or smaller success was a question having for her all the importance of his importance so that sympathy created for her a sort of visible suspense under pressure of which she bristled with filial reference with little filial recalls of expression movement tone it was all unmistakable and as pretty as possible if one would and even as funny but it put the pair so together as undivided by the marriage of each that the princess il n y avait pas a dire might sit where she liked she would still always in that house be irremediably maggie verver the prince found himself on this occasion so beset with that perception that its natural complement for him would really have been to wonder if mr verver had produced on people something of the same impression in the recorded cases of his having dined with his daughter this backward speculation had it begun to play however would have been easily arrested for it was at present to come over amerigo as never before that his remarkable father in law was the man in the world least equipped with different appearances for different hours he was simple he was a revelation of simplicity and that was the end of him so far as he consisted of an appearance at all a question that might verily for a weakness in it have been argued it amused our young man who was taking his pleasure to night it will be seen in sundry occult ways it amused him to feel how everything else the master of the house consisted of resources possessions facilities and amiabilities amplified by the social legend depended for conveying the effect of quantity on no personal equation no mere measurable medium quantity was in the air for these good people and mr verver s estimable quality was almost wholly in that pervasion he was meagre and modest and clearbrowed and his eyes if they wandered without fear yet stayed without defiance his shoulders were not broad his chest was not high his complexion was not fresh and the crown of his head was not covered in spite of all of which he looked at the top of his table so nearly like a little boy shyly entertaining in virtue of some imposed rank that he could only be one of the powers the representative of a force quite as an infant king is the representative of a dynasty in this generalised view of his father in law intensified to night but always operative amerigo had now for some time taken refuge the refuge after the reunion of the two households in england had more and more offered itself as the substitute for communities from man to man that by his original calculation might have become possible but that had not really ripened and flowered he met the decent family eyes across the table met them afterwards in the music room but only to read in them still what he had learned to read during his first months the time of over anxious initiation a kind of apprehension in which the terms and conditions were finally fixed and absolute this directed regard rested at its ease but it neither lingered nor penetrated and was to the prince s fancy much of the same order as any glance directed for due attention from the same quarter to the figure of a cheque received in the course of business and about to be enclosed to a banker it made sure of the amount and just so from time to time the amount of the prince was made sure he was being thus in renewed instalments perpetually paid in he already reposed in the bank as a value but subject in this comfortable way to repeated to infinite endorsement the net result of all of which moreover was that the young man had no wish to see his value diminish he himself after all had not fixed it the figure was a conception all of mr verver s own certainly however everything must be kept up to it never so much as to night had the prince felt this he would have been uncomfortable as these quiet expressions passed had the case not been guaranteed for him by the intensity of his accord with charlotte it was impossible that he should not now and again meet charlotte s eyes as it was also visible that she too now and again met her husband s for her as well in all his pulses he felt the conveyed impression it put them it kept them together through the vain show of their separation made the two other faces made the whole lapse of the evening the people the lights the flowers the pretended talk the exquisite music a mystic golden bridge between them strongly swaying and sometimes almost vertiginous for that intimacy of which the sovereign law would be the vigilance of care would be never rashly to forget and never consciously to wound xx the main interest of these hours for us however will have been in the way the prince continued to know during a particular succession of others separated from the evening in eaton square by a short interval a certain persistent aftertaste this was the lingering savour of a cup presented to him by fanny assingham s hand after dinner while the clustered quartette kept their ranged companions in the music room moved if one would but conveniently motionless mrs assingham contrived after a couple of pieces to convey to her friend that for her part she was moved by the genius of brahms beyond what she could bear so that without apparent deliberation she had presently floated away at the young man s side to such a distance as permitted them to converse without the effect of disdain it was the twenty minutes enjoyed with her during the rest of the concert in the less associated electric glare of one of the empty rooms it was their achieved and as he would have said successful most pleasantly successful talk on one of the sequestered sofas it was this that was substantially to underlie his consciousness of the later occasion the later occasion then mere matter of discussion had formed her ground for desiring in a light undertone into which his quick ear read indeed some nervousness these independent words with him she had sounded covertly but distinctly by the time they were seated together the great question of what it might involve it had come out for him before anything else and so abruptly that this almost needed an explanation then the abruptness itself had appeared to explain which had introduced in turn a slight awkwardness do you know that they re not after all going to matcham so that if they don t if at least maggie doesn t you won t i suppose go by yourself it was as i say at matcham where the event had placed him it was at matcham during the easter days that it most befell him oddly enough to live over inwardly for its wealth of special significance this passage by which the event had been really a good deal determined he had paid first and last many an english country visit he had learned even from of old to do the english things and to do them all sufficiently in the english way if he didn t always enjoy them madly he enjoyed them at any rate as much to an appearance as the good people who had in the night of time unanimously invented them and who still in the prolonged afternoon of their good faith unanimously even if a trifle automatically practised them yet with it all he had never so much as during such sojourns the trick of a certain detached the amusement of a certain inward critical life the determined need which apparently all participant of returning upon itself of backing noiselessly in far in again and rejoining there as it were that part of his mind that was not engaged at the front his body very constantly was engaged at the front in shooting in riding in golfing in walking over the fine diagonals of meadow paths or round the pocketed corners of billiard tables it sufficiently on the whole in fact bore the brunt of bridge playing of breakfasting lunching tea drinking dining and of the nightly climax over the bottigliera as he called it of the bristling tray it met finally to the extent of the limited tax on lip on gesture on wit most of the current demands of conversation and expression therefore something of him he often felt at these times was left out it was much more when he was alone or when he was with his own people or when he was say with mrs verver and nobody else that he moved that he talked that he listened that he felt as a congruous whole english society as he would have said cut him accordingly in two and he reminded himself often in his relations with it of a man possessed of a shining star a decoration an order of some sort something so ornamental as to make his identity not complete ideally without it yet who finding no other such object generally worn should be perpetually and the least bit ruefully unpinning it from his breast to transfer it to his pocket the prince s shining star may no doubt having been nothing more precious than his private subtlety but whatever the object was he just now fingered it a good deal out of sight amounting as it mainly did for him to a restless play of memory and a fine embroidery of thought something had rather momentously occurred in eaton square during his enjoyed minutes with his old friend his present perspective made definitely clear to him that she had plumped out for him her first little lie that took on and he could scarce have said why a sharpness of importance she had never lied to him before if only because it had never come up for her properly intelligibly morally that she must as soon as she had put to him the question of what he would do by which she meant of what charlotte would also do in that event of maggie s and mr verver s not embracing the proposal they had appeared for a day or two resignedly to entertain as soon as she had betrayed her curiosity as to the line the other pair so left to themselves might take a desire to avoid the appearance of at all too directly prying had become marked in her betrayed by the solicitude of which she had already three weeks before given him a view she had been obliged on a second thought to name intelligibly a reason for her appeal while the prince on his side had had not without mercy his glimpse of her momentarily groping for one and yet remaining unprovided not without mercy because absolutely he had on the spot in his friendliness invented one for her use presenting it to her with a look no more significant than if he had picked up to hand back to her a dropped flower you ask if i m likely also to back out then because it may make a difference in what you and the colonel decide he had gone as far as that for her fairly inviting her to assent though not having had his impression from any indication offered him by charlotte that the assinghams were really in question for the large matcham party the wonderful thing after this was that the active couple had in the interval managed to inscribe themselves on the golden roll an exertion of a sort that to do her justice he had never before observed fanny to make this last passage of the chapter but proved after all with what success she could work when she would once launched himself at any rate as he had been directed by all the terms of the intercourse between portland place and eaton square once steeped at matcham in the enjoyment of a splendid hospitality he found everything for his interpretation for his convenience fall easily enough into place and all the more that mrs verver was at hand to exchange ideas and impressions with the great house was full of people of possible new combinations of the quickened play of possible propinquity and no appearance of course was less to be cultivated than that of his having sought an opportunity to foregather with his friend at a safe distance from their respective sposi there was a happy boldness at the best in their mingling thus each unaccompanied in the same sustained sociability just exactly a touch of that eccentricity of associated freedom which sat so lightly on the imagination of the relatives left behind they were exposed as much as one would to its being pronounced funny that they should at such a rate go about together though on the other hand this consideration drew relief from the fact that in their high conditions and with the easy tradition the almost inspiring allowances of the house in question no individual line however freely marked was pronounced anything more than funny both our friends felt afresh as they had felt before the convenience of a society so placed that it had only its own sensibility to consider looking as it did well over the heads of all lower growths and that moreover treated its own sensibility quite as the easiest friendliest most informal and domesticated party to the general alliance what anyone thought of anyone else above all of anyone else with anyone else was a matter incurring in these lulls so little awkward formulation that hovering judgment the spirit with the scales might perfectly have been imaged there as some rather snubbed and subdued but quite trained and tactful poor relation of equal of the properest lineage only of aspect a little dingy doubtless from too limited a change of dress for whose tacit and abstemious presence never betrayed by a rattle of her rusty machine a room in the attic and a plate at the side table were decently usual it was amusing in such lightness of air that the prince should again present himself only to speak for the princess so unfortunately unable again to leave home and that mrs verver should as regularly figure as an embodied a beautifully deprecating apology for her husband who was all geniality and humility among his own treasures but as to whom the legend had grown up that he couldn t bear with the height of his standards and the tone of the company in the way of sofas and cabinets habitually kept by him the irritation and depression to which promiscuous visiting even at pompous houses had been found to expose him that was all right the noted working harmony of the clever son in law and the charming stepmother so long as the relation was for the effect in question maintained at the proper point between sufficiency and excess what with the noble fairness of the place meanwhile the generous mood of the sunny gusty lusty english april all panting and heaving with impatience or kicking and crying even at moments like some infant hercules who wouldn t be dressed what with these things and the bravery of youth and beauty the insolence of fortune and appetite so diffused among his fellow guests that the poor assinghams in their comparatively marked maturity and their comparatively small splendour were the only approach to a false note in the concert the stir of the air was such for going in a degree to one s head that as a mere matter of exposure almost grotesque in its flagrancy his situation resembled some elaborate practical joke carried out at his expense every voice in the great bright house was a call to the ingenuities and impunities of pleasure every echo was a defiance of difficulty doubt or danger every aspect of the picture a glowing plea for the immediate and as with plenty more to come was another phase of the spell for a world so constituted was governed by a spell that of the smile of the gods and the favour of the powers the only handsome the only gallant in fact the only intelligent acceptance of which was a faith in its guarantees and a high spirit for its chances its demand to that the thing came back was above all for courage and good humour and the value of this as a general assurance that is for seeing one through at the worst had not even in the easiest hours of his old roman life struck the prince so convincingly his old roman life had had more poetry no doubt but as he looked back upon it now it seemed to hang in the air of mere iridescent horizons to have been loose and vague and thin with large languorous unaccountable blanks the present order as it spread about him had somehow the ground under its feet and a trumpet in its ears and a bottomless bag of solid shining british sovereigns which was much to the point in its hand courage and good humour therefore were the breath of the day though for ourselves at least it would have been also much to the point that with amerigo really the innermost effect of all this perceptive ease was perhaps a strange final irritation he compared the lucid result with the extraordinary substitute for perception that presided in the bosom of his wife at so contented a view of his conduct and course a state of mind that was positively like a vicarious good conscience cultivated ingeniously on his behalf a perversity of pressure innocently persisted in and this wonder of irony became on occasion too intense to be kept wholly to himself it wasn t that at matcham anything particular anything monstrous anything that had to be noticed permitted itself as they said to happen there were only odd moments when the breath of the day as it has been called struck him so full in the face that he broke out with all the hilarity of what indeed would they have made of it they were of course maggie and her father moping so far as they ever consented to mope in monotonous eaton square but placid too in the belief that they knew beautifully what their expert companions were in for they knew it might have appeared in these lights absolutely nothing on earth worth speaking of whether beautifully or cynically and they would perhaps sometimes be a little less trying if they would only once for all peacefully admit that knowledge wasn t one of their needs and that they were in fact constitutionally inaccessible to it they were good children bless their hearts and the children of good children so that verily the principino himself as less consistently of that descent might figure to the fancy as the ripest genius of the trio the difficulty was for the nerves of daily intercourse with maggie in particular that her imagination was clearly never ruffled by the sense of any anomaly the great anomaly would have been that her husband or even that her father s wife should prove to have been made for the long run after the pattern set from so far back to the ververs if one was so made one had certainly no business on any terms at matcham whereas if one wasn t one had no business there on the particular terms terms of conformity with the principles of eaton square under which one had been so absurdly dedicated deep at the heart of that resurgent unrest in our young man which we have had to content ourselves with calling his irritation deep in the bosom of this falsity of position glowed the red spark of his inextinguishable sense of a higher and braver propriety there were situations that were ridiculous but that one couldn t yet help as for instance when one s wife chose in the most usual way to make one so precisely here however was the difference it had taken poor maggie to invent a way so extremely unusual yet to which none the less it would be too absurd that he should merely lend himself being thrust systematically with another woman and a woman one happened by the same token exceedingly to like and being so thrust that the theory of it seemed to publish one as idiotic or incapable this was a predicament of which the dignity depended all on one s own handling what was supremely grotesque in fact was the essential opposition of theories as if a galantuomo as he at least constitutionally conceived galantuomini could do anything but blush to go about at such a rate with such a person as mrs verver in a state of childlike innocence the state of our primitive parents before the fall the grotesque theory as he would have called it was perhaps an odd one to resent with violence and he did it also as a man of the world all merciful justice but assuredly none the less there was but one way really to mark and for his companion as much as for himself the commiseration in which they held it adequate comment on it could only be private but it could also at least be active and of rich and effectual comment charlotte and he were fortunately alike capable wasn t this consensus literally their only way not to be ungracious it was positively as if the measure of their escape from that danger were given by the growth between them during their auspicious visit of an exquisite sense of complicity xxi he found himself therefore saying with gaiety even to fanny assingham for their common concerned glance at eaton square the glance that was so markedly never as it might have been a glance at portland place what would our cari sposi have made of it here what would they you know really which overflow would have been reckless if already and surprisingly perhaps even to himself he had not got used to thinking of this friend as a person in whom the element of protest had of late been unmistakably allayed he exposed himself of course to her replying ah if it would have been so bad for them how can it be so good for you but quite apart from the small sense the question would have had at the best she appeared already to unite with him in confidence and cheer he had his view as well or at least a partial one of the inner spring of this present comparative humility which was all consistent with the retraction he had practically seen her make after mr verver s last dinner without diplomatising to do so with no effort to square her none to bribe her to an attitude for which he would have had no use in her if it were not sincere he yet felt how he both held her and moved her by the felicity of his taking pity all instinctively on her just discernible depression by just so much as he guessed that she felt herself as the slang was out of it out of the crystal current and the expensive picture by just so much had his friendship charmingly made up to her from hour to hour for the penalties as they might have been grossly called of her mistake her mistake had only been after all in her wanting to seem to him straight she had let herself in for being as she had made haste for that matter during the very first half hour at tea to proclaim herself the sole and single frump of the party the scale of everything was so different that all her minor values her quainter graces her little local authority her humour and her wardrobe alike for which it was enough elsewhere among her bons amis that they were hers dear fanny assingham s these matters and others would be all now as nought five minutes had sufficed to give her the fatal pitch in cadogan place she could always at the worst be picturesque for she habitually spoke of herself as local to sloane street whereas at matcham she should never be anything but horrible and it all would have come the disaster from the real refinement in her of the spirit of friendship to prove to him that she wasn t really watching him ground for which would have been too terribly grave she had followed him in his pursuit of pleasure so she might precisely mark her detachment this was handsome trouble for her to take the prince could see it all it wasn t a shade of interference that a good natured man would visit on her so he didn t even say when she told him how frumpy she knew herself how frumpy her very maid odiously going back on her rubbed it into her night and morning with unsealed eyes and lips that she now knew her he didn t then say ah see what you ve done isn t it rather your own fault he behaved differently altogether eminently distinguished himself for she told him she had never seen him so universally distinguished he yet distinguished her in her obscurity or in what was worse her objective absurdity and frankly invested her with her absolute value surrounded her with all the importance of her wit that wit as discriminated from stature and complexion a sense for bridge and a credit for pearls could have importance was meanwhile but dimly perceived at matcham so that his niceness to her she called it only niceness but it brought tears into her eyes had the greatness of a general as well as of a special demonstration she understands he said as a comment on all this to mrs verver she understands all she needs to understand she has taken her time but she has at last made it out for herself she sees how all we can desire is to give them the life they prefer to surround them with the peace and quiet and above all with the sense of security most favourable to it she can t of course very well put it to us that we have so far as she is concerned but to make the best of our circumstances she can t say in so many words don t think of me for i too must make the best of mine arrange as you can only and live as you must i don t get quite that from her any more than i ask for it but her tone and her whole manner mean nothing at all unless they mean that she trusts us to take as watchful to take as artful to take as tender care in our way as she so anxiously takes in hers so that she s well the prince wound up what you may call practically all right charlotte in fact however to help out his confidence didn t call it anything return as he might to the lucidity the importance or whatever it was of this lesson she gave him no aid toward reading it aloud she let him two or three times over spell it out for himself only on the eve of their visit s end was she for once clear or direct in response they had found a minute together in the great hall of the house during the half hour before dinner this easiest of chances they had already a couple of times arrived at by waiting persistently till the last other loiterers had gone to dress and by being prepared themselves to dress so expeditiously that they might a little later on be among the first to appear in festal array the hall then was empty before the army of rearranging cushion patting housemaids were marshalled in and there was a place by the forsaken fire at one end where they might imitate with art the unpremeditated above all here for the snatched instants they could breathe so near to each other that the interval was almost engulfed in it and the intensity both of the union and the caution became a workable substitute for contact they had prolongations of instants that counted as visions of bliss they had slow approximations that counted as long caresses the quality of these passages in truth made the spoken word and especially the spoken word about other people fall below them so that our young woman s tone had even now a certain dryness it s very good of her my dear to trust us but what else can she do why whatever people do when they don t trust let one see they don t but let whom see well let me say to begin with and should you mind that he had a slight show of surprise shouldn t you her letting you see no said charlotte the only thing i can imagine myself minding is what you yourself if you don t look out may let her see to which she added you may let her see you know that you re afraid i m only afraid of you a little at moments he presently returned but i shan t let fanny see that it was clear however that neither the limits nor the extent of mrs assingham s vision were now a real concern to her and she gave expression to this as she had not even yet done what in the world can she do against us there s not a word that she can breathe she s helpless she can t speak she would be herself the first to be dished by it and then as he seemed slow to follow it all comes back to her it all began with her everything from the first she introduced you to maggie she made your marriage the prince might have had his moment of demur but at this after a little as with a smile dim but deep he came on mayn t she also be said a good deal to have made yours that was intended i think wasn t it for a kind of rectification charlotte on her side for an instant hesitated then she was prompter still i don t mean there was anything to rectify everything was as it had to be and i m not speaking of how she may have been concerned for you and me i m speaking of how she took in her way each time their lives in hand and how therefore that ties her up to day she can t go to them and say it s very awkward of course you poor dear things but i was frivolously mistaken he took it in still with his long look at her all the more that she wasn t she was right everything s right he went on and everything will stay so then that s all i say but he worked it out for the deeper satisfaction even to superfluous lucidity we re happy and they re happy what more does the position admit of what more need fanny assingham want ah my dear said charlotte it s not i who say that she need want anything i only say that she s fixed that she must stand exactly where everything has by her own act placed her it s you who have seemed haunted with the possibility for her of some injurious alternative something or other we must be prepared for and she had with her high reasoning a strange cold smile we are prepared for anything for everything and as we are practically so she must take us she s condemned to consistency she s doomed poor thing to a genial optimism that luckily for her however is very much the law of her nature she was born to soothe and to smooth now then therefore mrs verver gently laughed she has the chance of her life so that her present professions may even at the best not be sincere may be but a mask for doubts and fears and for gaining time the prince had looked with the question as if this again could trouble him and it determined in his companion a slight impatience you keep talking about such things as if they were our affair at all i feel at any rate that i ve nothing to do with her doubts and fears or with anything she may feel she must arrange all that for herself it s enough for me that she ll always be of necessity much more afraid for herself really either to see or to speak than we should be to have her do it even if we were the idiots and cowards we aren t and charlotte s face with these words to the mitigation of the slightly hard ring there might otherwise have been in them fairly lightened softened shone out it reflected as really never yet the rare felicity of their luck it made her look for the moment as if she had actually pronounced that word of unpermitted presumption so apt is the countenance as with a finer consciousness than the tongue to betray a sense of this particular lapse she might indeed the next instant have seen her friend wince in advance at her use of a word that was already on her lips for it was still unmistakable with him that there were things he could prize forms of fortune he could cherish without at all proportionately liking their names had all this however been even completely present to his companion what other term could she have applied to the strongest and simplest of her ideas but the one that exactly fitted it she applied it then though her own instinct moved her at the same time to pay her tribute to the good taste from which they hadn t heretofore by a hair s breadth deviated if it didn t sound so vulgar i should say that we re fatally as it were safe pardon the low expression since it s what we happen to be we re so because they are and they re so because they can t be anything else from the moment that having originally intervened for them she wouldn t now be able to bear herself if she didn t keep them so that s the way she s inevitably with us said charlotte over her smile we hang essentially together well the prince candidly allowed she did bring it home to him every way it worked out yes i see we hang essentially together his friend had a shrug a shrug that had a grace cosa volete the effect beautifully nobly was more than roman ah beyond doubt it s a case he stood looking at her it s a case there can t he said have been many perhaps never never never any other that she smiled i confess i should like to think only ours only ours most probably speriamo to which as after hushed connections he presently added poor fanny but charlotte had already with a start and a warning hand turned from a glance at the clock she sailed away to dress while he watched her reach the staircase his eyes followed her till with a simple swift look round at him she vanished something in the sight however appeared to have renewed the spring of his last exclamation which he breathed again upon the air poor poor fanny it was to prove however on the morrow quite consistent with the spirit of these words that the party at matcham breaking up and multitudinously dispersing he should be able to meet the question of the social side of the process of repatriation with due presence of mind it was impossible for reasons that he should travel to town with the assinghams it was impossible for the same reasons that he should travel to town save in the conditions that he had for the last twenty four hours been privately and it might have been said profoundly thinking out the result of his thought was already precious to him and this put at his service he sufficiently believed the right tone for disposing of his elder friend s suggestion an assumption in fact equally full and mild that he and charlotte would conveniently take the same train and occupy the same compartment as the colonel and herself the extension of the idea to mrs verver had been precisely a part of mrs assingham s mildness and nothing could better have characterised her sense for social shades than her easy perception that the gentleman from portland place and the lady from eaton square might now confess quite without indiscretion to simultaneity of movement she had made for the four days no direct appeal to the latter personage but the prince was accidental witness of her taking a fresh start at the moment the company were about to scatter for the last night of their stay there had been at this climax the usual preparatory talk about hours and combinations in the midst of which poor fanny gently approached mrs verver she said you and the prince love quite apparently without blinking she took for granted their public withdrawal together she remarked that she and bob were alike ready in the interest of sociability to take any train that would make them all one party i feel really as if all this time i had seen nothing of you that gave an added grace to the candour of the dear thing s approach but just then it was on the other hand that the young man found himself borrow most effectively the secret of the right tone for doing as he preferred his preference had during the evening not failed of occasion to press him with mute insistences practically without words without any sort of straight telegraphy it had arrived at a felt identity with charlotte s own she spoke all for their friend while she answered their friend s question but she none the less signalled to him as definitely as if she had fluttered a white handkerchief from a window it s awfully sweet of you darling our going together would be charming but you mustn t mind us you must suit yourselves we ve settled amerigo and i to stay over till after luncheon amerigo with the chink of this gold in his ear turned straight away so as not to be instantly appealed to and for the very emotion of the wonder furthermore of what divination may achieve when winged by a community of passion charlotte had uttered the exact plea that he had been keeping ready for the same foreseen necessity and had uttered it simply as a consequence of their deepening unexpressed need of each other and without the passing between them of a word he hadn t god knew to take it from her he was too conscious of what he wanted but the lesson for him was in the straight clear tone that charlotte could thus distil in the perfect felicity of her adding no explanation no touch for plausibility that she wasn t strictly obliged to add and in the truly superior way in which women so situated express and distinguish themselves she had answered mrs assingham quite adequately she had not spoiled it by a reason a scrap larger than the smallest that would serve and she had above all thrown off for his stretched but covered attention an image that flashed like a mirror played at the face of the sun the measure of everything to all his sense at these moments was in it the measure especially of the thought that had been growing with him a positive obsession and that began to throb as never yet under this brush of her having by perfect parity of imagination the match for it his whole consciousness had by this time begun almost to ache with a truth of an exquisite order at the glow of which she too had so unmistakably then been warming herself the truth that the occasion constituted by the last few days couldn t possibly save by some poverty of their own refuse them some still other and still greater beauty it had already told them with an hourly voice that it had a meaning a meaning that their associated sense was to drain even as thirsty lips after the plough through the sands and the sight afar of the palm cluster might drink in at last the promised well in the desert there had been beauty day after day and there had been for the spiritual lips something of the pervasive taste of it yet it was all none the less as if their response had remained below their fortune how to bring it by some brave free lift up to the same height was the idea with which behind and beneath everything he was restlessly occupied and in the exploration of which as in that of the sun chequered greenwood of romance his spirit thus at the opening of a vista met hers they were already from that moment so hand in hand in the place that he found himself making use five minutes later of exactly the same tone as charlotte s for telling mrs assingham that he was likewise in the matter of the return to london sorry for what mightn t be this had become of a sudden the simplest thing in the world the sense of which moreover seemed really to amount to a portent that he should feel forevermore on the general head conveniently at his ease with her he went in fact a step further than charlotte put the latter forward as creating his necessity she was staying over luncheon to oblige their hostess as a consequence of which he must also stay to see her decently home he must deliver her safe and sound he felt in eaton square regret as he might too the difference made by this obligation he frankly didn t mind inasmuch as over and above the pleasure itself his scruple would certainly gratify both mr verver and maggie they never yet had absolutely and entirely learned he even found deliberation to intimate how little he really neglected the first as it seemed nowadays quite to have become of his domestic duties therefore he still constantly felt how little he must remit his effort to make them remark it to which he added with equal lucidity that they would return in time for dinner and if he didn t as a last word subjoin that it would be lovely of fanny to find on her own return a moment to go to eaton square and report them as struggling bravely on this was not because the impulse down to the very name for the amiable act altogether failed to rise his inward assurance his general plan had at moments where she was concerned its drops of continuity and nothing would less have pleased him than that she should suspect in him however tempted any element of conscious cheek but he was always that was really the upshot cultivating thanklessly the considerate and the delicate it was a long lesson this unlearning with people of english race all the little superstitions that accompany friendship mrs assingham herself was the first to say that she would unfailingly report she brought it out in fact he thought quite wonderfully having attained the summit of the wonderful during the brief interval that had separated her appeal to charlotte from this passage with himself she had taken the five minutes obviously amid the rest of the talk and the movement to retire into her tent for meditation which showed among several things the impression charlotte had made on her it was from the tent she emerged as with arms refurbished though who indeed could say if the manner in which she now met him spoke most really of the glitter of battle or of the white waver of the flag of truce the parley was short either way the gallantry of her offer was all sufficient i ll go to our friends then i ll ask for luncheon i ll tell them when to expect you that will be charming say we re all right all right precisely i can t say more mrs assingham smiled no doubt but he considered as for the possible importance of it neither can you by what i seem to feel say less oh i won t say less fanny laughed with which the next moment she had turned away but they had it again not less bravely on the morrow after breakfast in the thick of the advancing carriages and the exchange of farewells i think i ll send home my maid from euston she was then prepared to amend and go to eaton square straight so you can be easy oh i think we re easy the prince returned be sure to say at any rate that we re bearing up you re bearing up good and charlotte returns to dinner to dinner we re not likely i think to make another night away well then i wish you at least a pleasant day oh he laughed as they separated we shall do our best for it after which in due course with the announcement of their conveyance the assinghams rolled off xxii it was quite for the prince after this as if the view had further cleared so that the half hour during which he strolled on the terrace and smoked the day being lovely overflowed with the plenitude of its particular quality its general brightness was composed doubtless of many elements but what shone out of it as if the whole place and time had been a great picture from the hand of genius presented to him as a prime ornament for his collection and all varnished and framed to hang up what marked it especially for the highest appreciation was his extraordinarily unchallenged his absolutely appointed and enhanced possession of it poor fanny assingham s challenge amounted to nothing one of the things he thought of while he leaned on the old marble balustrade so like others that he knew in still more nobly terraced italy was that she was squared all conveniently even to herself and that rumbling toward london with this contentment she had become an image irrelevant to the scene it further passed across him as his imagination was for reasons during the time unprecedentedly active that he had after all gained more from women than he had ever lost by them there appeared so more and more on those mystic books that are kept in connection with such commerce even by men of the loosest business habits a balance in his favour that he could pretty well as a rule take for granted what were they doing at this very moment wonderful creatures but combine and conspire for his advantage from maggie herself most wonderful in her way of all to his hostess of the present hour into whose head it had so inevitably come to keep charlotte on for reasons of her own and who had asked in this benevolent spirit why in the world if not obliged without plausibility to hurry her husband s son in law should not wait over in her company he would at least see lady castledean had said that nothing dreadful should happen to her either while still there or during the exposure of the run to town and for that matter if they exceeded a little their license it would positively help them to have done so together each of them would in this way at home have the other comfortably to blame all of which besides in lady castledean as in maggie in fanny assingham as in charlotte herself was working for him without provocation or pressure by the mere play of some vague sense on their part definite and conscious at the most only in charlotte that he was not as a nature as a character as a gentleman in fine below his remarkable fortune but there were more things before him than even these things that melted together almost indistinguishably to feed his sense of beauty if the outlook was in every way spacious and the towers of three cathedrals in different counties as had been pointed out to him gleamed discernibly like dim silver in the rich sameness of tone didn t he somehow the more feel it so because precisely lady castledean had kept over a man of her own and that this offered a certain sweet intelligibility as the note of the day it made everything fit above all it diverted him to the extent of keeping up while he lingered and waited his meditative smile she had detained charlotte because she wished to detain mr blint and she couldn t detain mr blint disposed though he clearly was to oblige her without spreading over the act some ampler drapery castledean had gone up to london the place was all her own she had had a fancy for a quiet morning with mr blint a sleek civil accomplished young man distinctly younger than her ladyship who played and sang delightfully played even bridge and sang the english comic as well as the french tragic and the presence which really meant the absence of a couple of other friends if they were happily chosen would make everything all right the prince had the sense all good humouredly of being happily chosen and it was not spoiled for him even by another sense that followed in its train and with which during his life in england he had more than once had reflectively to deal the state of being reminded how after all as an outsider a foreigner and even as a mere representative husband and son in law he was so irrelevant to the working of affairs that he could be bent on occasion to uses comparatively trivial no other of her guests would have been thus convenient for their hostess affairs of whatever sorts had claimed by early trains every active easy smoothly working man each in his way a lubricated item of the great social political administrative engrenage claimed most of all castledean himself who was so very oddly given the personage and the type rather a large item if he on the other hand had an affair it was not of that order it was of the order verily that he had been reduced to as a not quite glorious substitute it marked however the feeling of the hour with him that this vision of being reduced interfered not at all with the measure of his actual ease it kept before him again at moments the so familiar fact of his sacrifices down to the idea of the very relinquishment for his wife s convenience of his real situation in the world with the consequence thus that he was in the last analysis among all these so often inferior people practically held cheap and made light of but though all this was sensible enough there was a spirit in him that could rise above it a spirit that positively played with the facts with all of them from that of the droll ambiguity of english relations to that of his having in mind something quite beautiful and independent and harmonious something wholly his own he couldn t somehow take mr blint seriously he was much more an outsider by the larger scale even than a roman prince who consented to be in abeyance yet it was past finding out either how such a woman as lady castledean could take him since this question but sank for him again into the fathomless depths of english equivocation he knew them all as was said well he had lived with them stayed with them dined hunted shot and done various other things with them but the number of questions about them he couldn t have answered had much rather grown than shrunken so that experience struck him for the most part as having left in him but one residual impression they didn t like les situations nettes that was all he was very sure of they wouldn t have them at any price it had been their national genius and their national success to avoid them at every point they called it themselves with complacency their wonderful spirit of compromise the very influence of which actually so hung about him here from moment to moment that the earth and the air the light and the colour the fields and the hills and the sky the blue green counties and the cold cathedrals owed to it every accent of their tone verily as one had to feel in presence of such a picture it had succeeded it had made up to now for that seated solidity in the rich sea mist on which the garish the supposedly envious peoples have ever cooled their eyes but it was at the same time precisely why even much initiation left one at given moments so puzzled as to the element of staleness in all the freshness and of freshness in all the staleness of innocence in the guilt and of guilt in the innocence there were other marble terraces sweeping more purple prospects on which he would have known what to think and would have enjoyed thereby at least the small intellectual fillip of a discerned relation between a given appearance and a taken meaning the inquiring mind in these present conditions might it was true be more sharply challenged but the result of its attention and its ingenuity it had unluckily learned to know was too often to be confronted with a mere dead wall a lapse of logic a confirmed bewilderment and moreover above all nothing mattered in the relation of the enclosing scene to his own consciousness but its very most direct bearings lady castledean s dream of mr blint for the morning was doubtless already with all the spacious harmonies re established taking the form of going over something with him at the piano in one of the numerous smaller rooms that were consecrated to the less gregarious uses what she had wished had been effected her convenience had been assured this made him however wonder the more where charlotte was since he didn t at all suppose her to be making a tactless third which would be to have accepted mere spectatorship in the duet of their companions the upshot of everything for him alike of the less and of the more was that the exquisite day bloomed there like a large fragrant flower that he had only to gather but it was to charlotte he wished to make the offering and as he moved along the terrace which rendered visible parts of two sides of the house he looked up at all the windows that were open to the april morning and wondered which of them would represent his friend s room it befell thus that his question after no long time was answered he saw charlotte appear above as if she had been called by the pausing of his feet on the flags she had come to the sill on which she leaned to look down and she remained there a minute smiling at him he had been immediately struck with her wearing a hat and a jacket which conduced to her appearance of readiness not so much to join him with a beautiful uncovered head and a parasol where he stood as to take with him some larger step altogether the larger step had been since the evening before intensely in his own mind though he had not fully thought out even yet the slightly difficult detail of it but he had had no chance such as he needed to speak the definite word to her and the face she now showed affected him accordingly as a notice that she had wonderfully guessed it for herself they had these identities of impulse they had had them repeatedly before and if such unarranged but unerring encounters gave the measure of the degree in which people were in the common phrase meant for each other no union in the world had ever been more sweetened with rightness what in fact most often happened was that her rightness went as who should say even further than his own they were conscious of the same necessity at the same moment only it was she as a general thing who most clearly saw her way to it something in her long look at him now out of the old grey window something in the very poise of her hat the colour of her necktie the prolonged stillness of her smile touched into sudden light for him all the wealth of the fact that he could count on her he had his hand there to pluck it on the open bloom of the day but what did the bright minute mean but that her answering hand was already intelligently out so therefore while the minute lasted it passed between them that their cup was full which cup their very eyes holding it fast carried and steadied and began as they tasted it to praise he broke however after a moment the silence it only wants a moon a mandolin and a little danger to be a serenade ah then she lightly called down let it at least have this with which she detached a rich white rosebud from its company with another in the front of her dress and flung it down to him he caught it in its fall fixing her again after she had watched him place it in his buttonhole come down quickly he said in an italian not loud but deep vengo vengo she as clearly but more lightly tossed out and she had left him the next minute to wait for her he came along the terrace again with pauses during which his eyes rested as they had already often done on the brave darker wash of far away watercolour that represented the most distant of the cathedral towns this place with its great church and its high accessibility its towers that distinguishably signalled its english history its appealing type its acknowledged interest this place had sounded its name to him half the night through and its name had become but another name the pronounceable and convenient one for that supreme sense of things which now throbbed within him he had kept saying to himself gloucester gloucester gloucester quite as if the sharpest meaning of all the years just passed were intensely expressed in it that meaning was really that his situation remained quite sublimely consistent with itself and that they absolutely he and charlotte stood there together in the very lustre of this truth every present circumstance helped to proclaim it it was blown into their faces as by the lips of the morning he knew why from the first of his marriage he had tried with such patience for such conformity he knew why he had given up so much and bored himself so much he knew why he at any rate had gone in on the basis of all forms on the basis of his having in a manner sold himself for a situation nette it had all been just in order that his well what on earth should he call it but his freedom should at present be as perfect and rounded and lustrous as some huge precious pearl he hadn t struggled nor snatched he was taking but what had been given him the pearl dropped itself with its exquisite quality and rarity straight into his hand here precisely it was incarnate its size and its value grew as mrs verver appeared afar off in one of the smaller doorways she came toward him in silence while he moved to meet her the great scale of this particular front at matcham multiplied thus in the golden morning the stages of their meeting and the successions of their consciousness it wasn t till she had come quite close that he produced for her his gloucester gloucester gloucester and his look at it over there she knew just where to look yes isn t it one of the best there are cloisters or towers or some thing and her eyes which though her lips smiled were almost grave with their depths of acceptance came back to him or the tomb of some old king we must see the old king we must do the cathedral he said we must know all about it if we could but take he exhaled the full opportunity and then while for all they seemed to give him he sounded again her eyes i feel the day like a great gold cup that we must somehow drain together i feel it as you always make me feel everything just as you do so that i know ten miles off how you feel but do you remember she asked apropos of great gold cups the beautiful one the real one that i offered you so long ago and that you wouldn t have just before your marriage she brought it back to him the gilded crystal bowl in the little bloomsbury shop oh yes but it took with a slight surprise on the prince s part some small recollecting the treacherous cracked thing you wanted to palm off on me and the little swindling jew who understood italian and who backed you up but i feel this an occasion he immediately added and i hope you don t mean he smiled that as an occasion it s also cracked they spoke naturally more low than loud overlooked as they were though at a respectful distance by tiers of windows but it made each find in the other s voice a taste as of something slowly and deeply absorbed don t you think too much of cracks and aren t you too afraid of them i risk the cracks said charlotte and i ve often recalled the bowl and the little swindling jew wondering if they ve parted company he made she said a great impression on me well you also no doubt made a great impression on him and i dare say that if you were to go back to him you d find he has been keeping that treasure for you but as to cracks the prince went on what did you tell me the other day you prettily call them in english rifts within the lute risk them as much as you like for yourself but don t risk them for me he spoke it in all the gaiety of his just barely tremulous serenity i go as you know by my superstitions and that s why he said i know where we are they re every one to day on our side resting on the parapet toward the great view she was silent a little and he saw the next moment that her eyes were closed i go but by one thing her hand was on the sun warmed stone so that turned as they were away from the house he put his own upon it and covered it i go by you she said i go by you so they remained a moment till he spoke again with a gesture that matched what is really our great necessity you know is to go by my watch it s already eleven he had looked at the time so that if we stop here to luncheon what becomes of our afternoon to this charlotte s eyes opened straight there s not the slightest need of our stopping here to luncheon don t you see she asked how i m ready he had taken it in but there was always more and more of her you mean you ve arranged it s easy to arrange my maid goes up with my things you ve only to speak to your man about yours and they can go together you mean we can leave at once she let him have it all one of the carriages about which i spoke will already have come back for us if your superstitions are on our side she smiled so my arrangements are and i ll back my support against yours then you had thought he wondered about gloucester she hesitated but it was only her way i thought you would think we have thank goodness these harmonies they are food for superstition if you like it s beautiful she went on that it should be gloucester glo ster glo ster as you say making it sound like an old song however i m sure glo ster glo ster will be charming she still added we shall be able easily to lunch there and with our luggage and our servants off our hands we shall have at least three or four hours we can wire she wound up from there ever so quietly she had brought it as she had thought it all out and it had to be as covertly that he let his appreciation expand then lady castledean doesn t dream of our staying he took it but thinking yet then what does she dream of mr blint poor dear of mr blint only her smile for him for the prince himself was free have i positively to tell you that she doesn t want us she only wanted us for the others to show she wasn t left alone with him now that that s done and that they ve all gone she of course knows for herself knows the prince vaguely echoed why that we like cathedrals that we inevitably stop to see them or go round to take them in whenever we ve a chance that it s what our respective families quite expect of us and would be disappointed for us to fail of this as forestieri mrs verver pursued would be our pull if our pull weren t indeed so great all round he could only keep his eyes on her and have you made out the very train the very one paddington the in that gives us oceans we can dine at the usual hour at home and as maggie will of course be in eaton square i hereby invite you for a while he still but looked at her it was a minute before he spoke thank you very much with pleasure to which he in a moment added but the train for gloucester a local one with several stops but doing it a good deal i forget how much within the hour so that we ve time only she said we must employ our time he roused himself as from the mere momentary spell of her he looked again at his watch while they moved back to the door through which she had advanced but he had also again questions and stops all as for the mystery and the charm you looked it up without my having asked you ah my dear she laughed i ve seen you with bradshaw it takes anglo saxon blood blood he echoed you ve that of every race it kept her before him you re terrible well he could put it as he liked i know the name of the inn what is it then there are two you ll see but i ve chosen the right one and i think i remember the tomb she smiled oh the tomb any tomb would do for him but i mean i had been keeping my idea so cleverly for you while there you already were with it you had been keeping it for me as much as you like but how do you make out she asked that you were keeping it from me i don t now how shall i ever keep anything some day when i shall wish to ah for things i mayn t want to know i promise you shall find me stupid they had reached their door where she herself paused to explain these days yesterday last night this morning i ve wanted everything well it was all right you shall have everything xxiii fanny on her arrival in town carried out her second idea despatching the colonel to his club for luncheon and packing her maid into a cab for cadogan place with the variety of their effects the result of this for each of the pair was a state of occupation so unbroken that the day practically passed without fresh contact between them they dined out together but it was both in going to their dinner and in coming back that they appeared on either side to have least to communicate fanny was wrapped in her thoughts still more closely than in the lemon coloured mantle that protected her bare shoulders and her husband with her silence to deal with showed himself not less disposed than usual when so challenged to hold up as he would have said his end of it they had in general in these days longer pauses and more abrupt transitions in one of which latter they found themselves for a climax launched at midnight mrs assingham rather wearily housed again ascended to the first floor there to sink overburdened on the landing outside the drawing room into a great gilded venetian chair of which at first however she but made with her brooding face a sort of throne of meditation she would thus have recalled a little with her so free orientalism of type the immemorially speechless sphinx about at last to become articulate the colonel not unlike on his side some old pilgrim of the desert camping at the foot of that monument went by way of reconnoissance into the drawing room he visited according to his wont the windows and their fastenings he cast round the place the eye all at once of the master and the manager the commandant and the rate payer then he came back to his wife before whom for a moment he stood waiting but she herself for a time continued to wait only looking up at him inscrutably there was in these minor manoeuvres and conscious patiences something of a suspension of their old custom of divergent discussion that intercourse by misunderstanding which had grown so clumsy now this familiar pleasantry seemed to desire to show it could yield on occasion to any clear trouble though it was also sensibly and just incoherently in the air that no trouble was at present to be vulgarly recognised as clear there might for that matter even have been in mr assingham s face a mild perception of some finer sense a sense for his wife s situation and the very situation she was oddly enough about to repudiate that she had fairly caused to grow in him but it was a flower to breathe upon gently and this was very much what she finally did she knew he needed no telling that she had given herself all the afternoon to her friends in eaton square and that her doing so would have been but the prompt result of impressions gathered in quantities in brimming baskets like the purple grapes of the vintage at matcham a process surrounded by him while it so unmistakably went on with abstentions and discretions that might almost have counted as solemnities the solemnities at the same time had committed him to nothing to nothing beyond this confession itself of a consciousness of deep waters she had been out on these waters for him visibly and his tribute to the fact had been his keeping her even if without a word well in sight he had not quitted for an hour during her adventure the shore of the mystic lake he had on the contrary stationed himself where she could signal to him at need her need would have arisen if the planks of her bark had parted then some sort of plunge would have become his immediate duty his present position clearly was that of seeing her in the centre of her sheet of dark water and of wondering if her actual mute gaze at him didn t perhaps mean that her planks were now parting he held himself so ready that it was quite as if the inward man had pulled off coat and waistcoat before he had plunged however that is before he had uttered a question he perceived not without relief that she was making for land he watched her steadily paddle always a little nearer and at last he felt her boat bump the bump was distinct and in fact she stepped ashore we were all wrong there s nothing nothing it was like giving her his hand up the bank between charlotte verver and the prince i was uneasy but i m satisfied now i was in fact quite mistaken there s nothing but i thought said bob assingham that that was just what you did persistently asseverate you ve guaranteed their straightness from the first no i ve never till now guaranteed anything but my own disposition to worry i ve never till now fanny went on gravely from her chair had such a chance to see and to judge i had it at that place if i had in my infatuation and my folly she added with expression nothing else so i did see i have seen and now i know her emphasis as she repeated the word made her head in her seat of infallibility rise higher i know the colonel took it but took it at first in silence do you mean they ve told you no i mean nothing so absurd for in the first place i haven t asked them and in the second their word in such a matter wouldn t count oh said the colonel with all his oddity they d tell us it made her face him an instant as with her old impatience of his short cuts always across her finest flower beds but she felt none the less that she kept her irony down then when they ve told you you ll be perhaps so good as to let me know he jerked up his chin testing the growth of his beard with the back of his hand while he fixed her with a single eye ah i don t say that they d necessarily tell me that they are over the traces they ll necessarily whatever happens hold their tongues i hope and i m talking of them now as i take them for myself only that s enough for me it s all i have to regard with which after an instant they re wonderful said fanny assingham indeed her husband concurred i really think they are you d think it still more if you knew but you don t know because you don t see their situation this was what he didn t see is too extraordinary too he was willing to try too extraordinary to be believed i mean if one didn t see but just that in a way is what saves them they take it seriously he followed at his own pace their situation the incredible side of it they make it credible credible then you do say to you she looked at him again for an interval they believe in it themselves they take it for what it is and that she said saves them but if what it is is just their chance it s their chance for what i told you when charlotte first turned up it s their chance for the idea that i was then sure she had the colonel showed his effort to recall oh your idea at different moments of any one of their ideas this dim procession visibly mustered before him and with the best will in the world he could but watch its immensity are you speaking now of something to which you can comfortably settle down again for a little she only glowered at him i ve come back to my belief and that i have done so well he asked as she paused well shows that i m right for i assure you i had wandered far now i m at home again and i mean said fanny assingham to stay here they re beautiful she declared the prince and charlotte the prince and charlotte that s how they re so remarkable and the beauty she explained is that they re afraid for them afraid i mean for the others for mr verver and maggie it did take some following afraid of what afraid of themselves the colonel wondered of themselves of mr verver s and maggie s selves mrs assingham remained patient as well as lucid yes of such blindness too but most of all of their own danger he turned it over that danger being the blindness that danger being their position what their position contains of all the elements i needn t at this time of day attempt to tell you it contains luckily for that s the mercy everything but blindness i mean on their part the blindness said fanny is primarily her husband s he stood for a moment he would have it straight whose husband s mr verver s she went on the blindness is most of all his that they feel that they see but it s also his wife s whose wife s he asked as she continued to gloom at him in a manner at variance with the comparative cheer of her contention and then as she only gloomed the prince s maggie s own maggie s very own she pursued as for herself he had a pause do you think maggie so blind the question isn t of what i think the question s of the conviction that guides the prince and charlotte who have better opportunities than i for judging the colonel again wondered are you so very sure their opportunities are better well his wife asked what is their whole so extraordinary situation their extraordinary relation but an opportunity ah my dear you have that opportunity of their extraordinary situation and relation as much as they with the difference darling she returned with some spirit that neither of those matters are if you please mine i see the boat they re in but i m not thank god in it myself to day however mrs assingham added to day in eaton square i did see well then what but she mused over it still oh many things more somehow than ever before it was as if god help me i was seeing for them i mean for the others it was as if something had happened i don t know what except some effect of these days with them at that place that had either made things come out or had cleared my own eyes these eyes indeed of the poor lady s rested on her companion s meanwhile with the lustre not so much of intenser insight as of a particular portent that he had at various other times had occasion to recognise she desired obviously to reassure him but it apparently took a couple of large candid gathering glittering tears to emphasise the fact they had immediately for him their usual direct action she must reassure him he was made to feel absolutely in her own way he would adopt it and conform to it as soon as he should be able to make it out the only thing was that it took such incalculable twists and turns the twist seemed remarkable for instance as she developed her indication of what had come out in the afternoon it was as if i knew better than ever what makes them what makes them he pressed her as she fitfully dropped well makes the prince and charlotte take it all as they do it might well have been difficult to know how to take it and they may even say for themselves that they were a long time trying to see as i say to day she went on it was as if i were suddenly with a kind of horrible push seeing through their eyes on which as to shake off her perversity fanny assingham sprang up but she remained there under the dim illumination and while the colonel with his high dry spare look of type to which a certain conformity to the whiteness of inaccessible snows in his necktie shirt front and waistcoat gave a rigour of accent waited watching her they might at the late hour and in the still house have been a pair of specious worldly adventurers driven for relief under sudden stress to some grim midnight reckoning in an odd corner her attention moved mechanically over the objects of ornament disposed too freely on the walls of staircase and landing as to which recognition for the time had lost both fondness and compunction i can imagine the way it works she said it s so easy to understand yet i don t want to be wrong she the next moment broke out i don t i don t want to be wrong to make a mistake you mean oh no she meant nothing of the sort she knew but too well what she meant i don t make mistakes but i perpetrate in thought crimes and she spoke with all intensity i m a most dreadful person there are times when i seem not to mind a bit what i ve done or what i think or imagine or fear or accept when i feel that i d do it again feel that i d do things myself ah my dear the colonel remarked in the coolness of debate yes if you had driven me back on my nature luckily for you you never have you ve done every thing else but you ve never done that but what i really don t a bit want she declared is to abet them or to protect them her companion turned this over what is there to protect them from if by your now so settled faith they ve done nothing that justly exposes them and it in fact half pulled her up well from a sudden scare from the alarm i mean of what maggie may think yet if your whole idea is that maggie thinks nothing she waited again it isn t my whole idea nothing is my whole idea for i felt to day as i tell you that there s so much in the air oh in the air the colonel dryly breathed well what s in the air always has hasn t it to come down to the earth and maggie mrs assingham continued is a very curious little person since i was in this afternoon for seeing more than i had ever done well i felt that too for some reason as i hadn t yet felt it for some reason for what reason and then as his wife at first said nothing did she give any sign was she in any way different she s always so different from anyone else in the world that it s hard to say when she s different from herself but she has made me said fanny after an instant think of her differently she drove me home home here first to portland place on her leaving her father since she does once in a while leave him that was to keep me with her a little longer but she kept the carriage and after tea there came with me herself back here this was also for the same purpose then she went home though i had brought her a message from the prince that arranged their movements otherwise he and charlotte must have arrived if they have arrived expecting to drive together to eaton square and keep maggie on to dinner there she has everything there you know she has clothes the colonel didn t in fact know but he gave it his apprehension oh you mean a change twenty changes if you like all sorts of things she dresses really maggie does as much for her father and she always did as for her husband or for herself she has her room in his house very much as she had it before she was married and just as the boy has quite a second nursery there in which mrs noble when she comes with him makes herself i assure you at home si bien that if charlotte in her own house so to speak should wish a friend or two to stay with her she really would be scarce able to put them up it was a picture into which as a thrifty entertainer himself bob assingham could more or less enter maggie and the child spread so maggie and the child spread so well he considered it is rather rum that s all i claim she seemed thankful for the word i don t say it s anything more but it is distinctly rum which after an instant the colonel took up more what more could it be it could be that she s unhappy and that she takes her funny little way of consoling herself for if she were unhappy mrs assingham had figured it out that s just the way i m convinced she would take but how can she be unhappy since as i m also convinced she in the midst of everything adores her husband as much as ever the colonel at this brooded for a little at large then if she s so happy please what s the matter it made his wife almost spring at him you think then she s secretly wretched but he threw up his arms in deprecation ah my dear i give them up to you i ve nothing more to suggest then it s not sweet of you she spoke at present as if he were frequently sweet you admit that it is rum and this indeed fixed again for a moment his intention has charlotte complained of the want of rooms for her friends never that i know of a word it isn t the sort of thing she does and whom has she after all mrs assingham added to complain to hasn t she always you oh me charlotte and i nowadays she spoke as of a chapter closed yet see the justice i still do her she strikes me more and more as extraordinary a deeper shade at the renewal of the word had come into the colonel s face if they re each and all so extraordinary then isn t that why one must just resign one s self to wash one s hands of them to be lost her face however so met the question as if it were but a flicker of the old tone that their trouble had now become too real for her charged eyes so betrayed the condition of her nerves that he stepped back alertly enough to firmer ground he had spoken before in this light of a plain man s vision but he must be something more than a plain man now hasn t she then charlotte always her husband to complain to she d rather die oh and bob assingham s face at the vision of such extremities lengthened for very docility hasn t she the prince then for such matters oh he doesn t count i thought that was just what as the basis of our agitation he does do mrs assingham however had her distinction ready not a bit as a person to bore with complaints the ground of my agitation is exactly that she never on any pretext bores him not charlotte and in the imagination of mrs verver s superiority to any such mistake she gave characteristically something like a toss of her head as marked a tribute to that lady s general grace in all the conditions as the personage referred to doubtless had ever received ah only maggie with which the colonel gave a short low gurgle but it found his wife again prepared no not only maggie a great many people in london and small wonder bore him maggie only worst then but it was a question that he had promptly dropped at the returning brush of another of which she had shortly before sown the seed you said just now that he would by this time be back with charlotte if they have arrived you think it then possible that they really won t have returned his companion exhibited to view for the idea a sense of her responsibility but this was insufficient clearly to keep her from entertaining it i think there s nothing they re not now capable of in their so intense good faith good faith he echoed the words which had in fact something of an odd ring critically their false position it comes to the same thing and she bore down with her decision the superficial lack of sequence they may very possibly for a demonstration as i see them not have come back he wondered visibly at this how she did see them may have bolted somewhere together may have stayed over at matcham itself till tomorrow may have wired home each of them since maggie left me may have done fanny assingham continued god knows what she went on suddenly with more emotion which at the pressure of some spring of her inner vision broke out in a wail of distress imperfectly smothered whatever they ve done i shall never know never never because i don t want to and because nothing will induce me so they may do as they like but i ve worked for them all she uttered this last with another irrepressible quaver and the next moment her tears had come though she had with the explosion quitted her husband as if to hide it from him she passed into the dusky drawing room where during his own prowl shortly previous he had drawn up a blind so that the light of the street lamps came in a little at the window she made for this window against which she leaned her head while the colonel with his lengthened face looked after her for a minute and hesitated he might have been wondering what she had really done to what extent beyond his knowledge or his conception in the affairs of these people she could have committed herself but to hear her cry and yet try not to was quickly enough too much for him he had known her at other times quite not try not to and that had not been so bad he went to her and put his arm round her he drew her head to his breast where while she gasped she let it stay a little all with a patience that presently stilled her yet the effect of this small crisis oddly enough was not to close their colloquy with the natural result of sending them to bed what was between them had opened out further had somehow through the sharp show of her feeling taken a positive stride had entered as it were without more words the region of the understood shutting the door after it and bringing them so still more nearly face to face they remained for some minutes looking at it through the dim window which opened upon the world of human trouble in general and which let the vague light play here and there upon gilt and crystal and colour the florid features looming dimly of fanny s drawing room and the beauty of what thus passed between them passed with her cry of pain with her burst of tears with his wonderment and his kindness and his comfort with the moments of their silence above all which might have represented their sinking together hand in hand for a time into the mystic lake where he had begun as we have hinted by seeing her paddle alone the beauty of it was that they now could really talk better than before because the basis had at last once for all defined itself what was the basis which fanny absolutely exacted but that charlotte and the prince must be saved so far as consistently speaking of them as still safe might save them it did save them somehow for fanny s troubled mind for that was the nature of the mind of women he conveyed to her now at all events by refusing her no gentleness that he had sufficiently got the tip and that the tip was all he had wanted this remained quite clear even when he presently reverted to what she had told him of her recent passage with maggie i don t altogether see you know what you infer from it or why you infer anything when he so expressed himself it was quite as if in possession of what they had brought up from the depths xxiv i can t say more this made his companion reply than that something in her face her voice and her whole manner acted upon me as nothing in her had ever acted before and just for the reason above all that i felt her trying her very best and her very best poor duck is very good to be quiet and natural it s when one sees people who always are natural making little pale pathetic blinking efforts for it then it is that one knows something s the matter i can t describe my impression you would have had it for yourself and the only thing that ever can be the matter with maggie is that by that i mean her beginning to doubt to doubt for the first time mrs assingham wound up of her wonderful little judgment of her wonderful little world it was impressive fanny s vision and the colonel as if himself agitated by it took another turn of prowling to doubt of fidelity to doubt of friendship poor duck indeed it will go hard with her but she ll put it all he concluded on charlotte mrs assingham still darkly contemplative denied this with a headshake she won t put it anywhere she won t do with it anything anyone else would she ll take it all herself you mean she ll make it out her own fault yes she ll find means somehow to arrive at that ah then the colonel dutifully declared she s indeed a little brick oh his wife returned you ll see in one way or another to what tune and she spoke of a sudden with an approach to elation so that as if immediately feeling his surprise she turned round to him she ll see me somehow through see you yes me i m the worst for said fanny assingham now with a harder exaltation i did it all i recognise that i accept it she won t cast it up at me she won t cast up anything so i throw myself upon her she ll bear me up she spoke almost volubly she held him with her sudden sharpness she ll carry the whole weight of us there was still nevertheless wonder in it you mean she won t mind i say love and he not unkindly stared then where s the difficulty there isn t any fanny declared with the same rich emphasis it kept him indeed as by the loss of the thread looking at her longer ah you mean there isn t any for us she met his look for a minute as if it perhaps a little too much imputed a selfishness a concern at any cost for their own surface then she might have been deciding that their own surface was after all what they had most to consider not she said with dignity if we properly keep our heads she appeared even to signify that they would begin by keeping them now this was what it was to have at last a constituted basis do you remember what you said to me that night of my first real anxiety after the foreign office party in the carriage as we came home yes he could recall it leave them to pull through precisely trust their own wit you practically said to save all appearances well i ve trusted it i have left them to pull through he hesitated and your point is that they re not doing so i ve left them she went on but now i see how and where i ve been leaving them all the while without knowing it to her to the princess and that s what i mean mrs assingham pensively pursued that s what happened to me with her to day she continued to explain it came home to me that that s what i ve really been doing oh i see i needn t torment myself she has taken them over the colonel declared that he saw yet it was as if at this he a little sightlessly stared but what then has happened from one day to the other to her what has opened her eyes they were never really shut she misses him then why hasn t she missed him before well facing him there among their domestic glooms and glints fanny worked it out she did but she wouldn t let herself know it she had her reason she wore her blind now at last her situation has come to a head to day she does know it and that s illuminating it has been mrs assingham wound up illuminating to me her husband attended but the momentary effect of his attention was vagueness again and the refuge of his vagueness was a gasp poor dear little girl ah no don t pity her this did however pull him up we mayn t even be sorry for her not now or at least not yet it s too soon that is if it isn t very much too late this will depend mrs assingham went on at any rate we shall see we might have pitied her before for all the good it would then have done her we might have begun some time ago now however she has begun to live and the way it comes to me the way it comes to me but again she projected her vision the way it comes to you can scarcely be that she ll like it the way it comes to me is that she will live the way it comes to me is that she ll triumph she said this with so sudden a prophetic flare that it fairly cheered her husband ah then we must back her no we mustn t touch her we mayn t touch any of them we must keep our hands off we must go on tiptoe we must simply watch and wait and meanwhile said mrs assingham we must bear it as we can that s where we are and serves us right we re in presence and so moving about the room as in communion with shadowy portents she left it till he questioned again in presence of what well of something possibly beautiful beautiful as it may come off she had paused there before him while he wondered you mean she ll get the prince back she raised her hand in quick impatience the suggestion might have been almost abject it isn t a question of recovery it won t be a question of any vulgar struggle to get him back she must have lost him and to have lost him she must have had him with which fanny shook her head what i take her to be waking up to is the truth that all the while she really hasn t had him never ah my dear the poor colonel panted never his wife repeated and she went on without pity do you remember what i said to you long ago that evening just before their marriage when charlotte had so suddenly turned up the smile with which he met this appeal was not it was to be feared robust what haven t you love said in your time so many things no doubt that they make a chance for my having once or twice spoken the truth i never spoke it more at all events than when i put it to you that evening that maggie was the person in the world to whom a wrong thing could least be communicated it was as if her imagination had been closed to it her sense altogether sealed that therefore fanny continued is what will now have to happen her sense will have to open i see he nodded to the wrong he nodded again almost cheerfully as if he had been keeping the peace with a baby or a lunatic to the very very wrong but his wife s spirit after its effort of wing was able to remain higher to what s called evil with a very big e for the first time in her life to the discovery of it to the knowledge of it to the crude experience of it and she gave for the possibility the largest measure to the harsh bewildering brush the daily chilling breath of it unless indeed and here mrs assingham noted a limit unless indeed as yet so far as she has come and if she comes no further simply to the suspicion and the dread what we shall see is whether that mere dose of alarm will prove enough he considered but enough for what then dear if not enough to break her heart enough to give her a shaking mrs assingham rather oddly replied to give her i mean the right one the right one won t break her heart it will make her she explained well it will make her by way of a change understand one or two things in the world but isn t it a pity the colonel asked that they should happen to be the one or two that will be the most disagreeable to her oh disagreeable they ll have had to be disagreeable to show her a little where she is they ll have had to be disagreeable to make her sit up they ll have had to be disagreeable to make her decide to live bob assingham was now at the window while his companion slowly revolved he had lighted a cigarette for final patience and he seemed vaguely to time her as she moved to and fro he had at the same time to do justice to the lucidity she had at last attained and it was doubtless by way of expression of this teachability that he let his eyes for a minute roll as from the force of feeling over the upper dusk of the room he had thought of the response his wife s words ideally implied decide to live ah yes for her child oh bother her child and he had never felt so snubbed for an exemplary view as when fanny now stopped short to live you poor dear for her father which is another pair of sleeves and mrs assingham s whole ample ornamented person irradiated with this the truth that had begun under so much handling to glow any idiot can do things for her child she ll have a motive more original and we shall see how it will work her she ll have to save him to save him to keep her father from her own knowledge that and she seemed to see it before her in her husband s very eyes will be work cut out with which as at the highest conceivable climax she wound up their colloquy good night there was something in her manner however or in the effect at least of this supreme demonstration that had fairly and by a single touch lifted him to her side so that after she had turned her back to regain the landing and the staircase he overtook her before she had begun to mount with the ring of excited perception ah but you know that s rather jolly jolly she turned upon it again at the foot of the staircase i mean it s rather charming charming it had still to be their law a little that she was tragic when he was comic i mean it s rather beautiful you just said yourself it would be only he pursued promptly with the impetus of this idea and as if it had suddenly touched with light for him connections hitherto dim only i don t quite see why that very care for him which has carried her to such other lengths precisely as affect one as so rum hasn t also by the same stroke made her notice a little more what has been going on ah there you are it s the question that i ve all along been asking myself she had rested her eyes on the carpet but she raised them as she pursued she let him have it straight and it s the question of an idiot an idiot well the idiot that i ve been in all sorts of ways so often of late have i asked it you re excusable since you ask it but now the answer i saw to day has all the while been staring me in the face then what in the world is it why the very intensity of her conscience about him the very passion of her brave little piety that s the way it has worked mrs assingham explained and i admit it to have been as rum a way as possible but it has been working from a rum start from the moment the dear man married to ease his daughter off and it then happened by an extraordinary perversity that the very opposite effect was produced with the renewed vision of this fatality however she could give but a desperate shrug i see the colonel sympathetically mused that was a rum start but his very response as she again flung up her arms seemed to make her sense for a moment intolerable yes there i am i was really at the bottom of it she declared i don t know what possessed me but i planned for him i goaded him on with which however the next moment she took herself up or rather i do know what possessed me for wasn t he beset with ravening women right and left and didn t he quite pathetically appeal for protection didn t he quite charmingly show one how he needed and desired it maggie she thus lucidly continued couldn t with a new life of her own give herself up to doing for him in the future all she had done in the past to fencing him in to keeping him safe and keeping them off one perceived this she went on out of the abundance of one s affection and one s sympathy it all blessedly came back to her when it wasn t all for the fiftieth time obscured in face of the present facts by anxiety and compunction one was no doubt a meddlesome fool one always is to think one sees people s lives for them better than they see them for themselves but one s excuse here she insisted was that these people clearly didn t see them for themselves didn t see them at all it struck one for very pity that they were making a mess of such charming material that they were but wasting it and letting it go they didn t know how to live and somehow one couldn t if one took an interest in them at all simply stand and see it that s what i pay for and the poor woman in straighter communion with her companion s intelligence at this moment she appeared to feel than she had ever been before let him have the whole of the burden of her consciousness i always pay for it sooner or later my sociable my damnable my unnecessary interest nothing of course would suit me but that it should fix itself also on charlotte charlotte who was hovering there on the edge of our lives when not beautifully and a trifle mysteriously flitting across them and who was a piece of waste and a piece of threatened failure just as for any possible good to the world mr verver and maggie were it began to come over me in the watches of the night that charlotte was a person who could keep off ravening women without being one herself either in the vulgar way of the others and that this service to mr verver would be a sweet employment for her future there was something of course that might have stopped me you know you know what i mean it looks at me she veritably moaned out of your face but all i can say is that it didn t the reason largely being once i had fallen in love with the beautiful symmetry of my plan that i seemed to feel sure maggie would accept charlotte whereas i didn t quite make out either what other woman or what other kind of woman one could think of her accepting i see i see she had paused meeting all the while his listening look and the fever of her retrospect had so risen with her talk that the desire was visibly strong in him to meet her on his side but with cooling breath one quite understands my dear it only however kept her there sombre i naturally see love what you understand which sits again perfectly in your eyes you see that i saw that maggie would accept her in helpless ignorance yes dearest and the grimness of her dreariness suddenly once more possessed her you ve only to tell me that that knowledge was my reason for what i did how when you do can i stand up to you you see she said with an ineffable headshake that i don t stand up i m down down down she declared yet she as quickly added there s just one little thing that helps to save my life and she kept him waiting but an instant they might easily they would perhaps even certainly have done something worse he thought worse than that charlotte ah don t tell me she cried that there could have been nothing worse there might as they were have been many things charlotte in her way is extraordinary he was almost simultaneous extraordinary she observes the forms said fanny assingham he hesitated with the prince for the prince and with the others she went on with mr verver wonderfully but above all with maggie and the forms she had to do even them justice are two thirds of conduct say he had married a woman who would have made a hash of them but he jerked back ah my dear i wouldn t say it for the world say she none the less pursued he had married a woman the prince would really have cared for you mean then he doesn t care for charlotte this was still a new view to jump to and the colonel perceptibly wished to make sure of the necessity of the effort for that while he stared his wife allowed him time at the end of which she simply said no then what on earth are they up to still however she only looked at him so that standing there before her with his hands in his pockets he had time further to risk soothingly another question are the forms you speak of that are two thirds of conduct what will be keeping her now by your hypothesis from coming home with him till morning yes absolutely their forms theirs maggie s and mr verver s those they impose on charlotte and the prince those she developed that so perversely as i say have succeeded in setting themselves up as the right ones he considered but only now at last really to relapse into woe your perversity my dear is exactly what i don t understand the state of things existing hasn t grown like a field of mushrooms in a night whatever they all round may be in for now is at least the consequence of what they ve done are they mere helpless victims of fate well fanny at last had the courage of it yes they are to be so abjectly innocent that is to be victims of fate and charlotte and the prince are abjectly innocent it took her another minute but she rose to the full height yes that is they were as much so in their way as the others there were beautiful intentions all round the prince s and charlotte s were beautiful of that i had my faith they were i d go to the stake otherwise she added i should have been a wretch and i ve not been a wretch i ve only been a double dyed donkey ah then he asked what does our muddle make them to have been well too much taken up with considering each other you may call such a mistake as that by what ever name you please it at any rate means all round their case it illustrates the misfortune said mrs assingham gravely of being too too charming this was another matter that took some following but the colonel again did his best yes but to whom doesn t it rather depend on that to whom have the prince and charlotte then been too charming to each other in the first place obviously and then both of them together to maggie to maggie he wonderingly echoed to maggie she was now crystalline by having accepted from the first so guilelessly yes so guilelessly themselves her guileless idea of still having her father of keeping him fast in her life then isn t one supposed in common humanity and if one hasn t quarrelled with him and one has the means and he on his side doesn t drink or kick up rows isn t one supposed to keep one s aged parent in one s life certainly when there aren t particular reasons against it that there may be others than his getting drunk is exactly the moral of what is before us in the first place mr verver isn t aged the colonel just hung fire but it came then why the deuce does he oh poor dear man behave as if he were she took a moment to meet it how do you know how he behaves well my own love we see how charlotte does again at this she faltered but again she rose ah isn t my whole point that he s charming to her doesn t it depend a bit on what she regards as charming she faced the question as if it were flippant then with a headshake of dignity she brushed it away it s mr verver who s really young it s charlotte who s really old and what i was saying she added isn t affected you were saying he did her the justice that they re all guileless that they were guileless all at first quite extraordinarily it s what i mean by their failure to see that the more they took for granted they could work together the more they were really working apart for i repeat fanny went on that i really believe charlotte and the prince honestly to have made up their minds originally that their very esteem for mr verver which was serious as well it might be would save them i see the colonel inclined himself and save him it comes to the same thing then save maggie that comes said mrs assingham to something a little different for maggie has done the most he wondered what do you call the most well she did it originally she began the vicious circle for that though you make round eyes at my associating her with vice is simply what it has been it s their mutual consideration all round that has made it the bottomless gulf and they re really so embroiled but because in their way they ve been so improbably good in their way yes the colonel grinned which was above all maggie s way no flicker of his ribaldry was anything to her now maggie had in the first place to make up to her father for her having suffered herself to become poor little dear as she believed so intensely married then she had to make up to her husband for taking so much of the time they might otherwise have spent together to make this reparation to mr verver perfect and her way to do this precisely was by allowing the prince the use the enjoyment whatever you may call it of charlotte to cheer his path by instalments as it were in proportion as she herself making sure her father was all right might be missed from his side by so much at the same time however mrs assingham further explained by so much as she took her young stepmother for this purpose away from mr verver by just so much did this too strike her as something again to be made up for it has saddled her you will easily see with a positively new obligation to her father an obligation created and aggravated by her unfortunate even if quite heroic little sense of justice she began with wanting to show him that his marriage could never under whatever temptation of her own bliss with the prince become for her a pretext for deserting or neglecting him then that in its order entailed her wanting to show the prince that she recognised how the other desire this wish to remain intensely the same passionate little daughter she had always been involved in some degree and just for the present so to speak her neglecting and deserting him i quite hold fanny with characteristic amplitude parenthesised that a person can mostly feel but one passion one tender passion that is at a time only that doesn t hold good for our primary and instinctive attachments the voice of blood such as one s feeling for a parent or a brother those may be intense and yet not prevent other intensities as you will recognise my dear when you remember how i continued tout betement to adore my mother whom you didn t adore for years after i had begun to adore you well maggie she kept it up is in the same situation as i was plus complications from which i was thank heaven exempt plus the complication above all of not having in the least begun with the sense for complications that i should have had before she knew it at any rate her little scruples and her little lucidities which were really so divinely blind her feverish little sense of justice as i say had brought the two others together as her grossest misconduct couldn t have done and now she knows something or other has happened yet hasn t heretofore known what she has only piled up her remedy poor child something that she has earnestly but confusedly seen as her necessary policy piled it on top of the policy on top of the remedy that she at first thought out for herself and that would really have needed since then so much modification her only modification has been the growth of her necessity to prevent her father s wondering if all in their life in common may be so certainly for the best she has now as never before to keep him unconscious that peculiar if he makes a point of it as their situation is there s anything in it all uncomfortable or disagreeable anything morally the least out of the way she has to keep touching it up to make it each day each month look natural and normal to him so that god forgive me the comparison she s like an old woman who has taken to painting and who has to lay it on thicker to carry it off with a greater audacity with a greater impudence even the older she grows and fanny stood a moment captivated with the image she had thrown off i like the idea of maggie audacious and impudent learning to be so to gloss things over she could she even will yet i believe learn it for that sacred purpose consummately diabolically for from the moment the dear man should see it s all rouge she paused staring at the vision it imparted itself even to bob then the fun would begin as it but made her look at him hard however he amended the form of his inquiry you mean that in that case she will charming creature be lost she was silent a moment more as i ve told you before she won t be lost if her father s saved she ll see that as salvation enough the colonel took it in then she s a little heroine rather she s a little heroine but it s his innocence above all mrs assingham added that will pull them through her companion at this focussed again mr verver s innocence it s awfully quaint of course it s awfully quaint that it s awfully quaint that the pair are awfully quaint quaint with all our dear old quaintness by which i don t mean yours and mine but that of my own sweet countrypeople from whom i ve so deplorably degenerated that mrs assingham declared was originally the head and front of their appeal to me and of my interest in them and of course i shall feel them quainter still she rather ruefully subjoined before they ve done with me this might be but it wasn t what most stood in the colonel s way you believe so in mr verver s innocence after two years of charlotte she stared but the whole point is just that two years of charlotte are what he hasn t really or what you may call undividedly had any more than maggie by your theory eh has really or undividedly had four of the prince it takes all she hasn t had the colonel conceded to account for the innocence that in her too so leaves us in admiration so far as it might be ribald again she let this pass it takes a great many things to account for maggie what is definite at all events is that strange though this be her effort for her father has up to now sufficiently succeeded she has made him she makes him accept the tolerably obvious oddity of their relation all round for part of the game behind her there protected and amused and as it were exquisitely humbugged the principino in whom he delights always aiding he has safely and serenely enough suffered the conditions of his life to pass for those he had sublimely projected he hadn t worked them out in detail any more than i had heaven pity me and the queerness has been exactly in the detail this for him is what it was to have married charlotte and they both she neatly wound up help both i mean that if maggie always in the breach makes it seem to him all so flourishingly to fit charlotte does her part not less and her part is very large charlotte fanny declared works like a horse so there it all was and her husband looked at her a minute across it and what does the prince work like she fixed him in return like a prince whereupon breaking short off to ascend to her room she presented her highly decorated back in which in odd places controlling the complications of its aspect the ruby or the garnet the turquoise and the topaz gleamed like faint symbols of the wit that pinned together the satin patches of her argument he watched her as if she left him positively under the impression of her mastery of her subject yes as if the real upshot of the drama before them was but that he had when it came to the tight places of life as life had shrunk for him now the most luminous of wives he turned off in this view of her majestic retreat the comparatively faint little electric lamp which had presided over their talk then he went up as immediately behind her as the billows of her amber train allowed making out how all the clearness they had conquered was even for herself a relief how at last the sense of the amplitude of her exposition sustained and floated her joining her however on the landing above where she had already touched a metallic point into light he found she had done perhaps even more to create than to extinguish in him the germ of a curiosity he held her a minute longer there was another plum in the pie what did you mean some minutes ago by his not caring for charlotte the prince s by his not really caring she recalled after a little benevolently enough i mean that men don t when it has all been too easy that s how in nine cases out of ten a woman is treated who has risked her life you asked me just now how he works she added but you might better perhaps have asked me how he plays well he made it up like a prince like a prince he is profoundly a prince for that she said with expression he s beautifully a case they re far rarer even in the highest circles than they pretend to be and that s what makes so much of his value he s perhaps one of the very last the last of the real ones so it is we must take him we must take him all round the colonel considered and how must charlotte if anything happens take him the question held her a minute and while she waited with her eyes on him she put out a grasping hand to his arm in the flesh of which he felt her answer distinctly enough registered thus she gave him standing off a little the firmest longest deepest injunction he had ever received from her nothing in spite of everything will happen nothing has happened nothing is happening he looked a trifle disappointed i see for us for us for whom else and he was to feel indeed how she wished him to understand it we know nothing on earth it was an undertaking he must sign so he wrote as it were his name we know nothing on earth it was like the soldiers watchword at night we re as innocent she went on in the same way as babes why not rather say he asked as innocent as they themselves are oh for the best of reasons because we re much more so he wondered but how can we be more for them oh easily we can be anything absolute idiots then absolute idiots and oh fanny breathed the way it will rest us well he looked as if there were something in that but won t they know we re not she barely hesitated charlotte and the prince think we are which is so much gained mr verver believes in our intelligence but he doesn t matter and maggie doesn t she know that we see before our noses yes this indeed took longer oh so far as she may guess it she ll give no sign so it comes to the same thing he raised his eyebrows comes to our not being able to help her that s the way we shall help her by looking like fools she threw up her hands she only wants herself to look like a bigger so there we are with which she brushed it away his conformity was promised something however still held her it broke to her own vision as a last wave of clearness moreover now she said i see i mean she added what you were asking me how i knew to day in eaton square that maggie s awake and she had indeed visibly got it it was by seeing them together seeing her with her father he fell behind again but you ve seen her often enough before never with my present eyes for nothing like such a test that of this length of the others absence together has hitherto occurred possibly but if she and mr verver insisted upon it why is it such a test because it has become one without their intending it it has spoiled so to speak on their hands it has soured eh the colonel said the word s horrible say rather it has changed perhaps fanny went on she did wish to see how much she can bear in that case she has seen only it was she alone who about the visit insisted her father insists on nothing and she watches him do it her husband looked impressed watches him for the first faint sign i mean of his noticing it doesn t as i tell you come but she s there for it to see and i felt she continued how she s there i caught her as it were in the fact she couldn t keep it from me though she left her post on purpose came home with me to throw dust in my eyes i took it all her dust but it was what showed me with which supreme lucidity she reached the door of her room luckily it showed me also how she has succeeded nothing from him has come you re so awfully sure sure nothing will good night she said she ll die first the golden bowl volume ii book second the princess part fourth xxv it was not till many days had passed that the princess began to accept the idea of having done a little something she was not always doing or indeed that of having listened to any inward voice that spoke in a new tone yet these instinctive postponements of reflection were the fruit positively of recognitions and perceptions already active of the sense above all that she had made at a particular hour made by the mere touch of her hand a difference in the situation so long present to her as practically unattackable this situation had been occupying for months and months the very centre of the garden of her life but it had reared itself there like some strange tall tower of ivory or perhaps rather some wonderful beautiful but outlandish pagoda a structure plated with hard bright porcelain coloured and figured and adorned at the overhanging eaves with silver bells that tinkled ever so charmingly when stirred by chance airs she had walked round and round it that was what she felt she had carried on her existence in the space left her for circulation a space that sometimes seemed ample and sometimes narrow looking up all the while at the fair structure that spread itself so amply and rose so high but never quite making out as yet where she might have entered had she wished she had not wished till now such was the odd case and what was doubtless equally odd besides was that though her raised eyes seemed to distinguish places that must serve from within and especially far aloft as apertures and outlooks no door appeared to give access from her convenient garden level the great decorated surface had remained consistently impenetrable and inscrutable at present however to her considering mind it was as if she had ceased merely to circle and to scan the elevation ceased so vaguely so quite helplessly to stare and wonder she had caught herself distinctly in the act of pausing then in that of lingering and finally in that of stepping unprecedentedly near the thing might have been by the distance at which it kept her a mahometan mosque with which no base heretic could take a liberty there so hung about it the vision of one s putting off one s shoes to enter and even verily of one s paying with one s life if found there as an interloper she had not certainly arrived at the conception of paying with her life for anything she might do but it was nevertheless quite as if she had sounded with a tap or two one of the rare porcelain plates she had knocked in short though she could scarce have said whether for admission or for what she had applied her hand to a cool smooth spot and had waited to see what would happen something had happened it was as if a sound at her touch after a little had come back to her from within a sound sufficiently suggesting that her approach had been noted if this image however may represent our young woman s consciousness of a recent change in her life a change now but a few days old it must at the same time be observed that she both sought and found in renewed circulation as i have called it a measure of relief from the idea of having perhaps to answer for what she had done the pagoda in her blooming garden figured the arrangement how otherwise was it to be named by which so strikingly she had been able to marry without breaking as she liked to put it with the past she had surrendered herself to her husband without the shadow of a reserve or a condition and yet she had not all the while given up her father the least little inch she had compassed the high city of seeing the two men beautifully take to each other and nothing in her marriage had marked it as more happy than this fact of its having practically given the elder the lonelier a new friend what had moreover all the while enriched the whole aspect of success was that the latter s marriage had been no more meassurably paid for than her own his having taken the same great step in the same free way had not in the least involved the relegation of his daughter that it was remarkable they should have been able at once so to separate and so to keep together had never for a moment from however far back been equivocal to her that it was remarkable had in fact quite counted at first and always and for each of them equally as part of their inspiration and their support there were plenty of singular things they were not enamoured of flights of brilliancy of audacity of originality that speaking at least for the dear man and herself were not at all in their line but they liked to think they had given their life this unusual extension and this liberal form which many families many couples and still more many pairs of couples would not have found workable that last truth had been distinctly brought home to them by the bright testimony the quite explicit envy of most of their friends who had remarked to them again and again that they must on all the showing to keep on such terms be people of the highest amiability equally including in the praise of course amerigo and charlotte it had given them pleasure as how should it not to find themselves shed such a glamour it had certainly that is given pleasure to her father and herself both of them distinguishably of a nature so slow to presume that they would scarce have been sure of their triumph without this pretty reflection of it so it was that their felicity had fructified so it was that the ivory tower visible and admirable doubtless from any point of the social field had risen stage by stage maggie s actual reluctance to ask herself with proportionate sharpness why she had ceased to take comfort in the sight of it represented accordingly a lapse from that ideal consistency on which her moral comfort almost at any time depended to remain consistent she had always been capable of cutting down more or less her prior term moving for the first time in her life as in the darkening shadow of a false position she reflected that she should either not have ceased to be right that is to be confident or have recognised that she was wrong though she tried to deal with herself for a space only as a silken coated spaniel who has scrambled out of a pond and who rattles the water from his ears her shake of her head again and again as she went was much of that order and she had the resource to which save for the rude equivalent of his generalising bark the spaniel would have been a stranger of humming to herself hard as a sign that nothing had happened to her she had not so to speak fallen in she had had no accident and had not got wet this at any rate was her pretension until after she began a little to wonder if she mightn t with or without exposure have taken cold she could at all events remember no time at which she had felt so excited and certainly none which was another special point that so brought with it as well the necessity for concealing excitement this birth of a new eagerness became a high pastime in her view precisely by reason of the ingenuity required for keeping the thing born out of sight the ingenuity was thus a private and absorbing exercise in the light of which might i so far multiply my metaphors i should compare her to the frightened but clinging young mother of an unlawful child the idea that had possession of her would be by our new analogy the proof of her misadventure but likewise all the while only another sign of a relation that was more to her than anything on earth she had lived long enough to make out for herself that any deep seated passion has its pangs as well as its joys and that we are made by its aches and its anxieties most richly conscious of it she had never doubted of the force of the feeling that bound her to her husband but to become aware almost suddenly that it had begun to vibrate with a violence that had some of the effect of a strain would rightly looked at after all but show that she was like thousands of women every day acting up to the full privilege of passion why in the world shouldn t she with every right if on consideration she saw no good reason against it the best reason against it would have been the possibility of some consequence disagreeable or inconvenient to others especially to such others as had never incommoded her by the egotism of their passions but if once that danger were duly guarded against the fulness of one s measure amounted to no more than the equal use of one s faculties or the proper playing of one s part it had come to the princess obscurely at first but little by little more conceivably that her faculties had not for a good while been concomitantly used the case resembled in a manner that of her once loved dancing a matter of remembered steps that had grown vague from her ceasing to go to balls she would go to balls again that seemed freely even crudely stated the remedy she would take out of the deep receptacles in which she had laid them away the various ornaments congruous with the greater occasions and of which her store she liked to think was none of the smallest she would have been easily to be figured for us at this occupation dipping at off moments and quiet hours in snatched visits and by draughty candle light into her rich collections and seeing her jewels again a little shyly but all unmistakably glow that in fact may pass as the very picture of her semi smothered agitation of the diversion she to some extent successfully found in referring her crisis so far as was possible to the mere working of her own needs it must be added however that she would have been at a loss to determine and certainly at first to which order that of self control or that of large expression the step she had taken the afternoon of her husband s return from matcham with his companion properly belonged for it had been a step distinctly on maggie s part her deciding to do something just then and there which would strike amerigo as unusual and this even though her departure from custom had merely consisted in her so arranging that he wouldn t find her as he would definitely expect to do in eaton square he would have strangely enough as might seem to him to come back home for it and there get the impression of her rather pointedly or at least all impatiently and independently awaiting him these were small variations and mild manoeuvres but they went accompanied on maggie s part as we have mentioned with an infinite sense of intention her watching by his fireside for her husband s return from an absence might superficially have presented itself as the most natural act in the world and the only one into the bargain on which he would positively have reckoned it fell by this circumstance into the order of plain matters and yet the very aspect by which it was in the event handed over to her brooding fancy was the fact that she had done with it all she had designed she had put her thought to the proof and the proof had shown its edge this was what was before her that she was no longer playing with blunt and idle tools with weapons that didn t cut there passed across her vision ten times a day the gleam of a bare blade and at this it was that she most shut her eyes most knew the impulse to cheat herself with motion and sound she had merely driven on a certain wednesday to portland place instead of remaining in eaton square and she privately repeated it again and again there had appeared beforehand no reason why she should have seen the mantle of history flung by a single sharp sweep over so commonplace a deed that all the same was what had happened it had been bitten into her mind all in an hour that nothing she had ever done would hereafter in some way yet to be determined so count for her perhaps not even what she had done in accepting in their old golden rome amerigo s proposal of marriage and yet by her little crouching posture there that of a timid tigress she had meant nothing recklessly ultimate nothing clumsily fundamental so that she called it names the invidious the grotesque attitude holding it up to her own ridicule reducing so far as she could the portee of what had followed it she had but wanted to get nearer nearer to something indeed that she couldn t that she wouldn t even to herself describe and the degree of this achieved nearness was what had been in advance incalculable her actual multiplication of distractions and suppressions whatever it did for her failed to prevent her living over again any chosen minute for she could choose them she could fix them of the freshness of relation produced by her having administered to her husband the first surprise to which she had ever treated him it had been a poor thing but it had been all her own and the whole passage was backwardly there a great picture hung on the wall of her daily life for her to make what she would of it fell for retrospect into a succession of moments that were watchable still almost in the manner of the different things done during a scene on the stage some scene so acted as to have left a great impression on the tenant of one of the stalls several of these moments stood out beyond the others and those she could feel again most count again like the firm pearls on a string had belonged more particularly to the lapse of time before dinner dinner which had been so late quite at nine o clock that evening thanks to the final lateness of amerigo s own advent these were parts of the experience though in fact there had been a good many of them between which her impression could continue sharply to discriminate before the subsequent passages much later on it was to be said the flame of memory turned to an equalising glow that of a lamp in some side chapel in which incense was thick the great moment at any rate for conscious repossession was doubtless the first the strange little timed silence which she had fully gauged on the spot as altogether beyond her own intention but which for just how long should she ever really know for just how long she could do nothing to break she was in the smaller drawing room in which she always sat and she had by calculation dressed for dinner on finally coming in it was a wonder how many things she had calculated in respect to this small incident a matter for the importance of which she had so quite indefinite a measure he would be late he would be very late that was the one certainty that seemed to look her in the face there was still also the possibility that if he drove with charlotte straight to eaton square he might think it best to remain there even on learning she had come away she had left no message for him on any such chance this was another of her small shades of decision though the effect of it might be to keep him still longer absent he might suppose she would already have dined he might stay with all he would have to tell just on purpose to be nice to her father she had known him to stretch the point to these beautiful ends far beyond that he had more than once stretched it to the sacrifice of the opportunity of dressing if she herself had now avoided any such sacrifice and had made herself during the time at her disposal quite inordinately fresh and quite positively smart this had probably added while she waited and waited to that very tension of spirit in which she was afterwards to find the image of her having crouched she did her best quite intensely by herself to banish any such appearance she couldn t help it if she couldn t read her pale novel ah that par exemple was beyond her but she could at least sit by the lamp with the book sit there with her newest frock worn for the first time sticking out all round her quite stiff and grand even perhaps a little too stiff and too grand for a familiar and domestic frock yet marked none the less this time she ventured to hope by incontestable intrinsic merit she had glanced repeatedly at the clock but she had refused herself the weak indulgence of walking up and down though the act of doing so she knew would make her feel on the polished floor with the rustle and the hang still more beautifully bedecked the difficulty was that it would also make her feel herself still more sharply in a state which was exactly what she proposed not to do the only drops of her anxiety had been when her thought strayed complacently with her eyes to the front of her gown which was in a manner a refuge a beguilement especially when she was able to fix it long enough to wonder if it would at last really satisfy charlotte she had ever been in respect to her clothes rather timorous and uncertain for the last year above all she had lived in the light of charlotte s possible and rather inscrutable judgment of them charlotte s own were simply the most charming and interesting that any woman had ever put on there was a kind of poetic justice in her being at last able in this particular thanks to means thanks quite to omnipotence freely to exercise her genius but maggie would have described herself as in these connections constantly and intimately torn conscious on one side of the impossibility of copying her companion and conscious on the other of the impossibility of sounding her independently to the bottom yes it was one of the things she should go down to her grave without having known how charlotte after all had been said really thought her stepdaughter looked under any supposedly ingenious personal experiment she had always been lovely about the stepdaughter s material braveries had done for her the very best with them but there had ever fitfully danced at the back of maggie s head the suspicion that these expressions were mercies not judgments embodying no absolute but only a relative frankness hadn t charlotte with so perfect a critical vision if the truth were known given her up as hopeless hopeless by a serious standard and thereby invented for her a different and inferior one in which as the only thing to be done she patiently and soothingly abetted her hadn t she in other words assented in secret despair perhaps even in secret irritation to her being ridiculous so that the best now possible was to wonder once in a great while whether one mightn t give her the surprise of something a little less out of the true note than usual something of this kind was the question that maggie while the absentees still delayed asked of the appearance she was endeavouring to present but with the result repeatedly again that it only went and lost itself in the thick air that had begun more and more to hang for our young woman over her accumulations of the unanswered they were there these accumulations they were like a roomful of confused objects never as yet sorted which for some time now she had been passing and re passing along the corridor of her life she passed it when she could without opening the door then on occasion she turned the key to throw in a fresh contribution so it was that she had been getting things out of the way they rejoined the rest of the confusion it was as if they found their place by some instinct of affinity in the heap they knew in short where to go and when she at present by a mental act once more pushed the door open she had practically a sense of method and experience what she should never know about charlotte s thought she tossed that in it would find itself in company and she might at last have been standing there long enough to see it fall into its corner the sight moreover would doubtless have made her stare had her attention been more free the sight of the mass of vain things congruous incongruous that awaited every addition it made her in fact with a vague gasp turn away and what had further determined this was the final sharp extinction of the inward scene by the outward the quite different door had opened and her husband was there it had been as strange as she could consent afterwards to think it it had been essentially what had made the abrupt bend in her life he had come back had followed her from the other house visibly uncertain this was written in the face he for the first minute showed her it had been written only for those seconds and it had appeared to go quickly after they began to talk but while it lasted it had been written large and though she didn t quite know what she had expected of him she felt she hadn t expected the least shade of embarrassment what had made the embarrassment she called it embarrassment so as to be able to assure herself she put it at the very worst what had made the particular look was his thus distinguishably wishing to see how he should find her why first that had later on kept coming to her the question dangled there as if it were the key to everything with the sense of it on the spot she had felt overwhelmingly that she was significant that so she must instantly strike him and that this had a kind of violence beyond what she had intended it was in fact even at the moment not absent from her view that he might easily have made an abject fool of her at least for the time she had indeed for just ten seconds been afraid of some such turn the uncertainty in his face had become so the next thing an uncertainty in the very air three words of impatience the least bit loud some outbreak of what in the world are you up to and what do you mean any note of that sort would instantly have brought her low and this all the more that heaven knew she hadn t in any manner designed to be high it was such a trifle her small breach with custom or at any rate with his natural presumption that all magnitude of wonder had already had before one could deprecate the shadow of it the effect of a complication it had made for him some difference that she couldn t measure this meeting him at home and alone instead of elsewhere and with others and back and back it kept coming to her that the blankness he showed her before he was able to see might should she choose to insist on it have a meaning have as who should say an historic value beyond the importance of momentary expressions in general she had naturally had on the spot no ready notion of what he might want to see it was enough for a ready notion not to speak of a beating heart that he did see that he saw his wife in her own drawing room at the hour when she would most properly be there he hadn t in any way challenged her it was true and after those instants during which she now believed him to have been harbouring the impression of something unusually prepared and pointed in her attitude and array he had advanced upon her smiling and smiling and thus without hesitation at the last had taken her into his arms the hesitation had been at the first and she at present saw that he had surmounted it without her help she had given him no help for if on the one hand she couldn t speak for hesitation so on the other and especially as he didn t ask her she couldn t explain why she was agitated she had known it all the while down to her toes known it in his presence with fresh intensity and if he had uttered but a question it would have pressed in her the spring of recklessness it had been strange that the most natural thing of all to say to him should have had that appearance but she was more than ever conscious that any appearance she had would come round more or less straight to her father whose life was now so quiet on the basis accepted for it that any alteration of his consciousness even in the possible sense of enlivenment would make their precious equilibrium waver that was at the bottom of her mind that their equilibrium was everything and that it was practically precarious a matter of a hair s breadth for the loss of the balance it was the equilibrium or at all events her conscious fear about it that had brought her heart into her mouth and the same fear was on either side in the silent look she and amerigo had exchanged the happy balance that demanded this amount of consideration was truly thus as by its own confession a delicate matter but that her husband had also his habit of anxiety and his general caution only brought them after all more closely together it would have been most beautifully therefore in the name of the equilibrium and in that of her joy at their feeling so exactly the same about it that she might have spoken if she had permitted the truth on the subject of her behaviour to ring out on the subject of that poor little behaviour which was for the moment so very limited a case of eccentricity why why have i made this evening such a point of our not all dining together well because i ve all day been so wanting you alone that i finally couldn t bear it and that there didn t seem any great reason why i should try to that came to me funny as it may at first sound with all the things we ve so wonderfully got into the way of bearing for each other you ve seemed these last days i don t know what more absent than ever before too absent for us merely to go on so it s all very well and i perfectly see how beautiful it is all round but there comes a day when something snaps when the full cup filled to the very brim begins to flow over that s what has happened to my need of you the cup all day has been too full to carry so here i am with it spilling it over you and just for the reason that is the reason of my life after all i ve scarcely to explain that i m as much in love with you now as the first hour except that there are some hours which i know when they come because they almost frighten me that show me i m even more so they come of themselves and ah they ve been coming after all after all some such words as those were what didn t ring out yet it was as if even the unuttered sound had been quenched here in its own quaver it was where utterance would have broken down by its very weight if he had let it get so far without that extremity at the end of a moment he had taken in what he needed to take that his wife was testifying that she adored and missed and desired him after all after all since she put it so she was right that was what he had to respond to that was what from the moment that as has been said he saw he had to treat as the most pertinent thing possible he held her close and long in expression of their personal reunion this obviously was one way of doing so he rubbed his cheek tenderly and with a deep vague murmur against her face that side of her face she was not pressing to his breast that was not less obviously another way and there were ways enough in short for his extemporised ease for the good humour she was afterwards to find herself thinking of as his infinite tact this last was partly no doubt because the question of tact might be felt as having come up at the end of a quarter of an hour during which he had liberally talked and she had genially questioned he had told her of his day the happy thought of his roundabout journey with charlotte all their cathedral hunting adventure and how it had turned out rather more of an affair than they expected the moral of it was at any rate that he was tired verily and must have a bath and dress to which end she would kindly excuse him for the shortest time possible she was to remember afterwards something that had passed between them on this how he had looked for her during an instant at the door before going out how he had met her asking him in hesitation first then quickly in decision whether she couldn t help him by going up with him he had perhaps also for a moment hesitated but he had declined her offer and she was to preserve as i say the memory of the smile with which he had opined that at that rate they wouldn t dine till ten o clock and that he should go straighter and faster alone such things as i say were to come back to her they played through her full after sense like lights on the whole impression the subsequent parts of the experience were not to have blurred their distinctness one of these subsequent parts the first had been the not inconsiderable length to her later and more analytic consciousness of this second wait for her husband s reappearance she might certainly with the best will in the world had she gone up with him have been more in his way than not since people could really almost always hurry better without help than with it still she could actually hardly have made him take more time than he struck her taking though it must indeed be added that there was now in this much thinking little person s state of mind no mere crudity of impatience something had happened rapidly with the beautiful sight of him and with the drop of her fear of having annoyed him by making him go to and fro subsidence of the fearsome for maggie s spirit was always at first positive emergence of the sweet and it was long since anything had been so sweet to her as the particular quality suddenly given by her present emotion to the sense of possession xxvi amerigo was away from her again as she sat there as she walked there without him for she had with the difference of his presence in the house ceased to keep herself from moving about but the hour was filled nevertheless with the effect of his nearness and above all with the effect strange in an intimacy so established of an almost renewed vision of the facts of his aspect she had seen him last but five days since yet he had stood there before her as if restored from some far country some long voyage some combination of dangers or fatigues this unquenchable variety in his appeal to her interest what did it mean but that reduced to the flatness of mere statement she was married by good fortune to an altogether dazzling person that was an old old story but the truth of it shone out to her like the beauty of some family picture some mellow portrait of an ancestor that she might have been looking at almost in surprise after a long intermission the dazzling person was upstairs and she was down and there were moreover the other facts of the selection and decision that this demonstration of her own had required and of the constant care that the equilibrium involved but she had all the same never felt so absorbingly married so abjectly conscious of a master of her fate he could do what he would with her in fact what was actually happening was that he was actually doing it what he would what he really would only that quantity itself escaped perhaps in the brightness of the high harmony familiar naming and discussing it was enough of a recognition for her that whatever the thing he might desire he would always absolutely bring it off she knew at this moment without a question with the fullest surrender how he had brought off in her by scarce more than a single allusion a perfect flutter of tenderness if he had come back tired tired from his long day the exertion had been literally in her service and her father s they two had sat at home at peace the principino between them the complications of life kept down the bores sifted out the large ease of the home preserved because of the way the others held the field and braved the weather amerigo never complained any more than for that matter charlotte did but she seemed to see to night as she had never yet quite done that their business of social representation conceived as they conceived it beyond any conception of her own and conscientiously carried out was an affair of living always in harness she remembered fanny assingham s old judgment that friend s description of her father and herself as not living at all as not knowing what to do or what might be done for them and there came back to her with it an echo of the long talk they had had together one september day at fawns under the trees when she put before him this dictum of fanny s that occasion might have counted for them she had already often made the reflection as the first step in an existence more intelligently arranged it had been an hour from which the chain of causes and consequences was definitely traceable so many things and at the head of the list her father s marriage having appeared to her to flow from charlotte s visit to fawns and that event itself having flowed from the memorable talk but what perhaps most came out in the light of these concatenations was that it had been for all the world as if charlotte had been had in as the servants always said of extra help because they had thus suffered it to be pointed out to them that if their family coach lumbered and stuck the fault was in its lacking its complement of wheels having but three as they might say it had wanted another and what had charlotte done from the first but begin to act on the spot and ever so smoothly and beautifully as a fourth nothing had been immediately more manifest than the greater grace of the movement of the vehicle as to which for the completeness of her image maggie was now supremely to feel how every strain had been lightened for herself so far as she was one of the wheels she had but to keep in her place since the work was done for her she felt no weight and it wasn t too much to acknowledge that she had scarce to turn round she had a long pause before the fire during which she might have been fixing with intensity her projected vision have been conscious even of its taking an absurd fantastic shape she might have been watching the family coach pass and noting that somehow amerigo and charlotte were pulling it while she and her father were not so much as pushing they were seated inside together dandling the principino and holding him up to the windows to see and be seen like an infant positively royal so that the exertion was all with the others maggie found in this image a repeated challenge again and yet again she paused before the fire after which each time in the manner of one for whom a strong light has suddenly broken she gave herself to livelier movement she had seen herself at last in the picture she was studying suddenly jump from the coach whereupon frankly with the wonder of the sight her eyes opened wider and her heart stood still for a moment she looked at the person so acting as if this person were somebody else waiting with intensity to see what would follow the person had taken a decision which was evidently because an impulse long gathering had at last felt a sharpest pressure only how was the decision to be applied what in particular would the figure in the picture do she looked about her from the middle of the room under the force of this question as if there exactly were the field of action involved then as the door opened again she recognised whatever the action the form at any rate of a first opportunity her husband had reappeared he stood before her refreshed almost radiant quite reassuring dressed anointed fragrant ready above all for his dinner he smiled at her over the end of their delay it was as if her opportunity had depended on his look and now she saw that it was good there was still for the instant something in suspense but it passed more quickly than on his previous entrance he was already holding out his arms it was for hours and hours later on as if she had somehow been lifted aloft were floated and carried on some warm high tide beneath which stumbling blocks had sunk out of sight this came from her being again for the time in the enjoyment of confidence from her knowing as she believed what to do all the next day and all the next she appeared to herself to know it she had a plan and she rejoiced in her plan this consisted of the light that suddenly breaking into her restless reverie had marked the climax of that vigil it had come to her as a question what if i ve abandoned them you know what if i ve accepted too passively the funny form of our life there would be a process of her own by which she might do differently in respect to amerigo and charlotte a process quite independent of any process of theirs such a solution had but to rise before her to affect her to charm her with its simplicity an advantageous simplicity she had been stupid for so long not to have been struck by and the simplicity meanwhile seemed proved by the success that had already begun to attend her she had only had herself to do something to see how immediately it answered this consciousness of its having answered with her husband was the uplifting sustaining wave he had met her she so put it to herself met her with an effect of generosity and of gaiety in especial on his coming back to her ready for dinner which she wore in her breast as the token of an escape for them both from something not quite definite but clearly much less good even at that moment in fact her plan had begun to work she had been when he brightly reappeared in the act of plucking it out of the heart of her earnestness plucking it in the garden of thought as if it had been some full blown flower that she could present to him on the spot well it was the flower of participation and as that then and there she held it out to him putting straightway into execution the idea so needlessly so absurdly obscured of her sharing with him whatever the enjoyment the interest the experience might be and sharing also for that matter with charlotte she had thrown herself at dinner into every feature of the recent adventure of the companions letting him see without reserve that she wished to hear everything about it and making charlotte in particular charlotte s judgment of matcham charlotte s aspect her success there her effect traceably produced her clothes inimitably worn her cleverness gracefully displayed her social utility in fine brilliantly exemplified the subject of endless inquiry maggie s inquiry was most empathetic moreover for the whole happy thought of the cathedral hunt which she was so glad they had entertained and as to the pleasant results of which down to the cold beef and bread and cheese the queer old smell and the dirty table cloth at the inn amerigo was good humouredly responsive he had looked at her across the table more than once as if touched by the humility of this welcome offered to impressions at second hand the amusements the large freedoms only of others as if recognising in it something fairly exquisite and at the end while they were alone before she had rung for a servant he had renewed again his condonation of the little irregularity such as it was on which she had ventured they had risen together to come upstairs he had been talking at the last about some of the people at the very last of all about lady castledean and mr blint after which she had once more broken ground on the matter of the type of gloucester it brought her as he came round the table to join her yet another of his kind conscious stares one of the looks visibly beguiled but at the same time not invisibly puzzled with which he had already shown his sense of this charming grace of her curiosity it was as if he might for a moment be going to say you needn t pretend dearest quite so hard needn t think it necessary to care quite so much it was as if he stood there before her with some such easy intelligence some such intimate reassurance on his lips her answer would have been all ready that she wasn t in the least pretending and she looked up at him while he took her hand with the maintenance the real persistence of her lucid little plan in her eyes she wanted him to understand from that very moment that she was going to be with him again quite with them together as she doubtless hadn t been since the funny changes that was really all one could call them into which they had each as for the sake of the others too easily and too obligingly slipped they had taken too much for granted that their life together required as people in london said a special form which was very well so long as the form was kept only for the outside world and was made no more of among themselves than the pretty mould of an iced pudding or something of that sort into which to help yourself you didn t hesitate to break with the spoon so much as that she would with an opening have allowed herself furthermore to observe she wanted him to understand how her scheme embraced charlotte too so that if he had but uttered the acknowledgment she judged him on the point of making the acknowledgment of his catching at her brave little idea for their case she would have found herself as distinctly voluble almost to eloquence what befell however was that even while she thus waited she felt herself present at a process taking place rather deeper within him than the occasion on the whole appeared to require a process of weighing something in the balance of considering deciding dismissing he had guessed that she was there with an idea there in fact by reason of her idea only this oddly enough was what at the last stayed his words she was helped to these perceptions by his now looking at her still harder than he had yet done which really brought it to the turn of a hair for her that she didn t make sure his notion of her idea was the right one it was the turn of a hair because he had possession of her hands and was bending toward her ever so kindly as if to see to understand more or possibly give more she didn t know which and that had the effect of simply putting her as she would have said in his power she gave up let her idea go let everything go her one consciousness was that he was taking her again into his arms it was not till afterwards that she discriminated as to this felt how the act operated with him instead of the words he hadn t uttered operated in his view as probably better than any words as always better in fact at any time than anything her acceptance of it her response to it inevitable foredoomed came back to her later on as a virtual assent to the assumption he had thus made that there was really nothing such a demonstration didn t anticipate and didn t dispose of and that the spring acting within herself moreover might well have been beyond any other the impulse legitimately to provoke it it made for any issue the third time since his return that he had drawn her to his breast and at present holding her to his side as they left the room he kept her close for their moving into the hall and across it kept her for their slow return together to the apartments above he had been right overwhelmingly right as to the felicity of his tenderness and the degree of her sensibility but even while she felt these things sweep all others away she tasted of a sort of terror of the weakness they produced in her it was still for her that she had positively something to do and that she mustn t be weak for this must much rather be strong for many hours after none the less she remained weak if weak it was though holding fast indeed to the theory of her success since her agitated overture had been after all so unmistakably met she recovered soon enough on the whole the sense that this left her charlotte always to deal with charlotte who at any rate however she might meet overtures must meet them at the worst more or less differently of that inevitability of such other ranges of response as were open to charlotte maggie took the measure in approaching her on the morrow of her return from matcham with the same show of desire to hear all her story she wanted the whole picture from her as she had wanted it from her companion and promptly in eaton square whither without the prince she repaired almost ostentatiously for the purpose this purpose only she brought her repeatedly back to the subject both in her husband s presence and during several scraps of independent colloquy before her father instinctively maggie took the ground that his wish for interesting echoes would be not less than her own allowing that is for everything his wife would already have had to tell him for such passages between them as might have occurred since the evening before joining them after luncheon reaching them in her desire to proceed with the application of her idea before they had quitted the breakfast room the scene of their mid day meal she referred in her parent s presence to what she might have lost by delay and expressed the hope that there would be an anecdote or two left for her to pick up charlotte was dressed to go out and her husband it appeared rather positively prepared not to he had left the table but was seated near the fire with two or three of the morning papers and the residuum of the second and third posts on a stand beside him more even than the usual extravagance as maggie s glance made out of circulars catalogues advertisements announcements of sales foreign envelopes and foreign handwritings that were as unmistakable as foreign clothes charlotte at the window looking into the side street that abutted on the square might have been watching for their visitor s advent before withdrawing and in the light strange and coloured like that of a painted picture which fixed the impression for her objects took on values not hitherto so fully shown it was the effect of her quickened sensibility she knew herself again in presence of a problem in need of a solution for which she must intensely work that consciousness lately born in her had been taught the evening before to accept a temporary lapse but had quickly enough again with her getting out of her own house and her walking across half the town for she had come from portland place on foot found breath still in its lungs it exhaled this breath in a sigh faint and unheard her tribute while she stood there before speaking to realities looming through the golden mist that had already begun to be scattered the conditions facing her had yielded for the time to the golden mist had considerably melted away but there they were again definite and it was for the next quarter of an hour as if she could have counted them one by one on her fingers sharp to her above all was the renewed attestation of her father s comprehensive acceptances which she had so long regarded as of the same quality with her own but which so distinctly now she should have the complication of being obliged to deal with separately they had not yet struck her as absolutely extraordinary which had made for her lumping them with her own since her view of her own had but so lately begun to change though it instantly stood out for her that there was really no new judgment of them she should be able to show without attracting in some degree his attention without perhaps exciting his surprise and making thereby for the situation she shared with him some difference she was reminded and warned by the concrete image and for a minute charlotte s face immediately presented to her affected her as searching her own to see the reminder tell she had not less promptly kissed her stepmother and then had bent over her father from behind and laid her cheek upon him little amenities tantamount heretofore to an easy change of guard charlotte s own frequent though always cheerful term of comparison for this process of transfer maggie figured thus as the relieving sentry and so smoothly did use and custom work for them that her mate might even on this occasion after acceptance of the pass word have departed without irrelevant and in strictness unsoldierly gossip this was not none the less what happened inasmuch as if our young woman had been floated over her first impulse to break the existing charm at a stroke it yet took her but an instant to sound at any risk the note she had been privately practising if she had practised it the day before at dinner on amerigo she knew but the better how to begin for it with mrs verver and it immensely helped her for that matter to be able at once to speak of the prince as having done more to quicken than to soothe her curiosity frankly and gaily she had come to ask to ask what in their unusually prolonged campaign the two had achieved she had got out of her husband she admitted what she could but husbands were never the persons who answered such questions ideally he had only made her more curious and she had arrived early this way in order to miss as little as possible of charlotte s story wives papa she said are always much better reporters though i grant she added for charlotte that fathers are not much better than husbands he never she smiled tells me more than a tenth of what you tell him so i hope you haven t told him everything yet since in that case i shall probably have lost the best part of it maggie went she went she felt herself going she reminded herself of an actress who had been studying a part and rehearsing it but who suddenly on the stage before the footlights had begun to improvise to speak lines not in the text it was this very sense of the stage and the footlights that kept her up made her rise higher just as it was the sense of action that logically involved some platform action quite positively for the first time in her life or counting in the previous afternoon for the second the platform remained for three or four days thus sensibly under her feet and she had all the while with it the inspiration of quite remarkably of quite heroically improvising preparation and practice had come but a short way her part opened out and she invented from moment to moment what to say and to do she had but one rule of art to keep within bounds and not lose her head certainly she might see for a week how far that would take her she said to herself in her excitement that it was perfectly simple to bring about a difference touch by touch without letting either of the three and least of all her father so much as suspect her hand if they should suspect they would want a reason and the humiliating truth was that she wasn t ready with a reason not that is with what she would have called a reasonable one she thought of herself instinctively beautifully as having dealt all her life at her father s side and by his example only in reasonable reasons and what she would really have been most ashamed of would be to produce for him in this line some inferior substitute unless she were in a position to plead definitely that she was jealous she should be in no position to plead decently that she was dissatisfied this latter condition would be a necessary implication of the former without the former behind it it would have to fall to the ground so had the case wonderfully been arranged for her there was a card she could play but there was only one and to play it would be to end the game she felt herself as at the small square green table between the tall old silver candlesticks and the neatly arranged counters her father s playmate and partner and what it constantly came back to in her mind was that for her to ask a question to raise a doubt to reflect in any degree on the play of the others would be to break the charm the charm she had to call it since it kept her companion so constantly engaged so perpetually seated and so contentedly occupied to say anything at all would be in fine to have to say why she was jealous and she could in her private hours but stare long with suffused eyes at that impossibility by the end of a week the week that had begun especially with her morning hour in eaton square between her father and his wife her consciousness of being beautifully treated had become again verily greater than her consciousness of anything else and i must add moreover that she at last found herself rather oddly wondering what else as a consciousness could have been quite so overwhelming charlotte s response to the experiment of being more with her ought as she very well knew to have stamped the experiment with the feeling of success so that if the success itself seemed a boon less substantial than the original image of it it enjoyed thereby a certain analogy with our young woman s aftertaste of amerigo s own determined demonstrations maggie was to have retained for that matter more than one aftertaste and if i have spoken of the impressions fixed in her as soon as she had so insidiously taken the field a definite note must be made of her perception during those moments of charlotte s prompt uncertainty she had shown no doubt she couldn t not have shown that she had arrived with an idea quite exactly as she had shown her husband the night before that she was awaiting him with a sentiment this analogy in the two situations was to keep up for her the remembrance of a kinship of expression in the two faces in respect to which all she as yet professed to herself was that she had affected them or at any rate the sensibility each of them so admirably covered in the same way to make the comparison at all was for maggie to return to it often to brood upon it to extract from it the last dregs of its interest to play with it in short nervously vaguely incessantly as she might have played with a medallion containing on either side a cherished little portrait and suspended round her neck by a gold chain of a firm fineness that no effort would ever snap the miniatures were back to back but she saw them forever face to face and when she looked from one to the other she found in charlotte s eyes the gleam of the momentary what does she really want that had come and gone for her in the prince s so again she saw the other light the light touched into a glow both in portland place and in eaton square as soon as she had betrayed that she wanted no harm wanted no greater harm of charlotte that is than to take in that she meant to go out with her she had been present at that process as personally as she might have been present at some other domestic incident the hanging of a new picture say or the fitting of the principino with his first little trousers she remained present accordingly all the week so charmingly and systematically did mrs verver now welcome her company charlotte had but wanted the hint and what was it but the hint after all that during the so subdued but so ineffaceable passage in the breakfast room she had seen her take it had been taken moreover not with resignation not with qualifications or reserves however bland it had been taken with avidity with gratitude with a grace of gentleness that supplanted explanations the very liberality of this accommodation might indeed have appeared in the event to give its own account of the matter as if it had fairly written the princess down as a person of variations and had accordingly conformed but to a rule of tact in accepting these caprices for law the caprice actually prevailing happened to be that the advent of one of the ladies anywhere should till the fit had changed become the sign unfailingly of the advent of the other and it was emblazoned in rich colour on the bright face of this period that mrs verver only wished to know on any occasion what was expected of her only held herself there for instructions in order even to better them if possible the two young women while the passage lasted became again very much the companions of other days the days of charlotte s prolonged visits to the admiring and bountiful maggie the days when equality of condition for them had been all the result of the latter s native vagueness about her own advantages the earlier elements flushed into life again the frequency the intimacy the high pitch of accompanying expression appreciation endearment confidence the rarer charm produced in each by this active contribution to the felicity of the other all enhanced furthermore enhanced or qualified who should say which by a new note of diplomacy almost of anxiety just sensible on charlotte s part in particular of intensity of observance in the matter of appeal and response in the matter of making sure the princess might be disposed or gratified that resembled an attempt to play again with more refinement at disparity of relation charlotte s attitude had in short its moments of flowering into pretty excesses of civility self effacements in the presence of others sudden little formalisms of suggestion and recognition that might have represented her sense of the duty of not losing sight of a social distinction this impression came out most for maggie when in their easier intervals they had only themselves to regard and when her companion s inveteracy of never passing first of not sitting till she was seated of not interrupting till she appeared to give leave of not forgetting too familiarly that in addition to being important she was also sensitive had the effect of throwing over their intercourse a kind of silver tissue of decorum it hung there above them like a canopy of state a reminder that though the lady in waiting was an established favourite safe in her position a little queen however good natured was always a little queen and might with small warning remember it and yet another of these concomitants of feverish success all the while was the perception that in another quarter too things were being made easy charlotte s alacrity in meeting her had in one sense operated slightly overmuch as an intervention it had begun to reabsorb her at the very hour of her husband s showing her that to be all there as the phrase was he likewise only required as one of the other phrases was too the straight tip she had heard him talk about the straight tip in his moods of amusement at english slang in his remarkable displays of assimilative power power worthy of better causes and higher inspirations and he had taken it from her at need in a way that certainly in the first glow of relief had made her brief interval seem large then however immediately and even though superficially there had declared itself a readjustment of relations to which she was once more practically a little sacrificed i must do everything she had said without letting papa see what i do at least till it s done but she scarce knew how she proposed even for the next few days to blind or beguile this participant in her life what had in fact promptly enough happened she presently recognised was that if her stepmother had beautifully taken possession of her and if she had virtually been rather snatched again thereby from her husband s side so on the other hand this had with as little delay entailed some very charming assistance for her in eaton square when she went home with charlotte from whatever happy demonstration for the benefit of the world in which they supposed themselves to live that there was no smallest reason why their closer association shouldn t be public and acclaimed at these times she regularly found that amerigo had come either to sit with his father in law in the absence of the ladies or to make on his side precisely some such display of the easy working of the family life as would represent the equivalent of her excursions with charlotte under this particular impression it was that everything in maggie most melted and went to pieces every thing that is that belonged to her disposition to challenge the perfection of their common state it divided them again that was true this particular turn of the tide cut them up afresh into pairs and parties quite as if a sense for the equilibrium was what between them all had most power of insistence quite as if amerigo himself were all the while at bottom equally thinking of it and watching it but as against that he was making her father not miss her and he could have rendered neither of them a more excellent service he was acting in short on a cue the cue given him by observation it had been enough for him to see the shade of change in her behaviour his instinct for relations the most exquisite conceivable prompted him immediately to meet and match the difference to play somehow into its hands that was what it was she renewedly felt to have married a man who was sublimely a gentleman so that in spite of her not wanting to translate all their delicacies into the grossness of discussion she yet found again and again in portland place moments for saying if i didn t love you you know for yourself i should still love you for him he looked at her after such speeches as charlotte looked in eaton square when she called her attention to his benevolence through the dimness of the almost musing smile that took account of her extravagance harmless though it might be as a tendency to reckon with but my poor child charlotte might under this pressure have been on the point of replying that s the way nice people are all round so that why should one be surprised about it we re all nice together as why shouldn t we be if we hadn t been we wouldn t have gone far and i consider that we ve gone very far indeed why should you take on as if you weren t a perfect dear yourself capable of all the sweetest things as if you hadn t in fact grown up in an atmosphere the atmosphere of all the good things that i recognised even of old as soon as i came near you and that you ve allowed me now between you to make so blessedly my own mrs verver might in fact have but just failed to make another point a point charmingly natural to her as a grateful and irreproachable wife it isn t a bit wonderful i may also remind you that your husband should find when opportunity permits worse things to do than to go about with mine i happen love to appreciate my husband i happen perfectly to understand that his acquaintance should be cultivated and his company enjoyed some such happily provoked remarks as these from charlotte at the other house had been in the air but we have seen how there was also in the air for our young woman as an emanation from the same source a distilled difference of which the very principle was to keep down objections and retorts that impression came back it had its hours of doing so and it may interest us on the ground of its having prompted in maggie a final reflection a reflection out of the heart of which a light flashed for her like a great flower grown in a night as soon as this light had spread a little it produced in some quarters a surprising distinctness made her of a sudden ask herself why there should have been even for three days the least obscurity the perfection of her success decidedly was like some strange shore to which she had been noiselessly ferried and where with a start she found herself quaking at the thought that the boat might have put off again and left her the word for it the word that flashed the light was that they were treating her that they were proceeding with her and for that matter with her father by a plan that was the exact counterpart of her own it was not from her that they took their cue but and this was what in particular made her sit up from each other and with a depth of unanimity an exact coincidence of inspiration that when once her attention had begun to fix it struck her as staring out at her in recovered identities of behaviour expression and tone they had a view of her situation and of the possible forms her own consciousness of it might take a view determined by the change of attitude they had had ever so subtly to recognise in her on their return from matcham they had had to read into this small and all but suppressed variation a mute comment on they didn t quite know what and it now arched over the princess s head like a vault of bold span that important communication between them on the subject couldn t have failed of being immediate this new perception bristled for her as we have said with odd intimations but questions unanswered played in and out of it as well the question for instance of why such promptitude of harmony should have been important ah when she began to recover piece by piece the process became lively she might have been picking small shining diamonds out of the sweepings of her ordered house she bent in this pursuit over her dust bin she challenged to the last grain the refuse of her innocent economy then it was that the dismissed vision of amerigo that evening in arrest at the door of her salottino while her eyes from her placed chair took him in then it was that this immense little memory gave out its full power since the question was of doors she had afterwards she now saw shut it out she had responsibly shut in as we have understood shut in there with her sentient self only the fact of his reappearance and the plenitude of his presence these things had been testimony after all to supersede any other for on the spot even while she looked the warmly washing wave had travelled far up the strand she had subsequently lived for hours she couldn t count under the dizzying smothering welter positively in submarine depths where everything came to her through walls of emerald and mother of pearl though indeed she had got her head above them for breath when face to face with charlotte again on the morrow in eaton square meanwhile none the less as was so apparent the prior the prime impression had remained in the manner of a spying servant on the other side of the barred threshold a witness availing himself in time of the lightest pretext to re enter it was as if he had found this pretext in her observed necessity of comparing comparing the obvious common elements in her husband s and her stepmother s ways of now taking her with or without her witness at any rate she was led by comparison to a sense of the quantity of earnest intention operating and operating so harmoniously between her companions and it was in the mitigated midnight of these approximations that she had made out the promise of her dawn it was a worked out scheme for their not wounding her for their behaving to her quite nobly to which each had in some winning way induced the other to contribute and which therefore so far as that went proved that she had become with them a subject of intimate study quickly quickly on a certain alarm taken eagerly and anxiously before they should without knowing it wound her they had signalled from house to house their clever idea the idea by which for all these days her own idea had been profiting they had built her in with their purpose which was why above her a vault seemed more heavily to arch so that she sat there in the solid chamber of her helplessness as in a bath of benevolence artfully prepared for her over the brim of which she could but just manage to see by stretching her neck baths of benevolence were very well but at least unless one were a patient of some sort a nervous eccentric or a lost child one was usually not so immersed save by one s request it wasn t in the least what she had requested she had flapped her little wings as a symbol of desired flight not merely as a plea for a more gilded cage and an extra allowance of lumps of sugar above all she hadn t complained not by the quaver of a syllable so what wound in particular had she shown her fear of receiving what wound had she received as to which she had exchanged the least word with them if she had ever whined or moped they might have had some reason but she would be hanged she conversed with herself in strong language if she had been from beginning to end anything but pliable and mild it all came back in consequence to some required process of their own a process operating quite positively as a precaution and a policy they had got her into the bath and for consistency with themselves which was with each other must keep her there in that condition she wouldn t interfere with the policy which was established which was arranged her thought over this arrived at a great intensity had indeed its pauses and timidities but always to take afterwards a further and lighter spring the ground was well nigh covered by the time she had made out her husband and his colleague as directly interested in preventing her freedom of movement policy or no policy it was they themselves who were arranged she must be kept in position so as not to disarrange them it fitted immensely together the whole thing as soon as she could give them a motive for strangely as it had by this time begun to appear to herself she had hitherto not imagined them sustained by an ideal distinguishably different from her own of course they were arranged all four arranged but what had the basis of their life been precisely but that they were arranged together amerigo and charlotte were arranged together but she to confine the matter only to herself was arranged apart it rushed over her the full sense of all this with quite another rush from that of the breaking wave of ten days before and as her father himself seemed not to meet the vaguely clutching hand with which during the first shock of complete perception she tried to steady herself she felt very much alone xxvii there had been from far back that is from the christmas time on a plan that the parent and the child should do something lovely together and they had recurred to it on occasion nursed it and brought it up theoretically though without as yet quite allowing it to put its feet to the ground the most it had done was to try a few steps on the drawing room carpet with much attendance on either side much holding up and guarding much anticipation in fine of awkwardness or accident their companions by the same token had constantly assisted at the performance following the experiment with sympathy and gaiety and never so full of applause maggie now made out for herself as when the infant project had kicked its little legs most wildly kicked them for all the world across the channel and half the continent kicked them over the pyrenees and innocently crowed out some rich spanish name she asked herself at present if it had been a real belief that they were but wanting for some such adventure to snatch their moment whether either had at any instant seen it as workable save in the form of a toy to dangle before the other that they should take flight without wife or husband for one more look before they died at the madrid pictures as well as for a drop of further weak delay in respect to three or four possible prizes privately offered rarities of the first water responsibly reported on and profusely photographed still patiently awaiting their noiseless arrival in retreats to which the clue had not otherwise been given away the vision dallied with during the duskier days in eaton square had stretched to the span of three or four weeks of springtime for the total adventure three or four weeks in the very spirit after all of their regular life as their regular life had been persisting full of shared mornings afternoons evenings walks drives looks in at old places on vague chances full also in especial of that purchased social ease the sense of the comfort and credit of their house which had essentially the perfection of something paid for but which came on the whole so cheap that it might have been felt as costing as costing the parent and child nothing it was for maggie to wonder at present if she had been sincere about their going to ask herself whether she would have stuck to their plan even if nothing had happened her view of the impossibility of sticking to it now may give us the measure of her sense that everything had happened a difference had been made in her relation to each of her companions and what it compelled her to say to herself was that to behave as she might have behaved before would be to act for amerigo and charlotte with the highest hypocrisy she saw in these days that a journey abroad with her father would more than anything else have amounted on his part and her own to a last expression of an ecstasy of confidence and that the charm of the idea in fact had been in some such sublimity day after day she put off the moment of speaking as she inwardly and very comprehensively called it speaking that is to her father and all the more that she was ridden by a strange suspense as to his himself breaking silence she gave him time gave him during several days that morning that noon that night and the next and the next and the next even made up her mind that if he stood off longer it would be proof conclusive that he too wasn t at peace they would then have been all successfully throwing dust in each other s eyes and it would be at last as if they must turn away their faces since the silver mist that protected them had begun to grow sensibly thin finally at the end of april she decided that if he should say nothing for another period of twenty four hours she must take it as showing that they were in her private phraseology lost so little possible sincerity could there be in pretending to care for a journey to spain at the approach of a summer that already promised to be hot such a proposal on his lips such an extravagance of optimism would be his way of being consistent for that he didn t really want to move or to move further at the worst than back to fawns again could only signify that he wasn t at heart contented what he wanted at any rate and what he didn t want were in the event put to the proof for maggie just in time to give her a fresh wind she had been dining with her husband in eaton square on the occasion of hospitality offered by mr and mrs verver to lord and lady castledean the propriety of some demonstration of this sort had been for many days before our group the question reduced to the mere issue of which of the two houses should first take the field the issue had been easily settled in the manner of every issue referred in any degree to amerigo and charlotte the initiative obviously belonged to mrs verver who had gone to matcham while maggie had stayed away and the evening in eaton square might have passed for a demonstration all the more personal that the dinner had been planned on intimate lines six other guests only in addition to the host and the hostess of matcham made up the company and each of these persons had for maggie the interest of an attested connection with the easter revels at that visionary house their common memory of an occasion that had clearly left behind it an ineffaceable charm this air of beatific reference less subdued in the others than in amerigo and charlotte lent them together an inscrutable comradeship against which the young woman s imagination broke in a small vain wave it wasn t that she wished she had been of the remembered party and possessed herself of its secrets for she didn t care about its secrets she could concern herself at present absolutely with no secret but her own what occurred was simply that she became aware at a stroke of the quantity of further nourishment required by her own and of the amount of it she might somehow extract from these people whereby she rose of a sudden to the desire to possess and use them even to the extent of braving of fairly defying of directly exploiting of possibly quite enjoying under cover of an evil duplicity the felt element of curiosity with which they regarded her once she was conscious of the flitting wing of this last impression the perception irresistible that she was something for their queer experience just as they were something for hers there was no limit to her conceived design of not letting them escape she went and went again to night after her start was taken went positively as she had felt herself going three weeks before on the morning when the vision of her father and his wife awaiting her together in the breakfast room had been so determinant in this other scene it was lady castledean who was determinant who kindled the light or at all events the heat and who acted on the nerves lady castledean whom she knew she so oddly didn t like in spite of reasons upon reasons the biggest diamonds on the yellowest hair the longest lashes on the prettiest falsest eyes the oldest lace on the most violet velvet the rightest manner on the wrongest assumption her ladyship s assumption was that she kept at every moment of her life every advantage it made her beautifully soft very nearly generous so she didn t distinguish the little protuberant eyes of smaller social insects often endowed with such a range from the other decorative spots on their bodies and wings maggie had liked in london and in the world at large so many more people than she had thought it right to fear right even to so much as judge that it positively quickened her fever to have to recognise in this case such a lapse of all the sequences it was only that a charming clever woman wondered about her that is wondered about her as amerigo s wife and wondered moreover with the intention of kindness and the spontaneity almost of surprise the point of view that one was what she read in their free contemplation in that of the whole eight there was something in amerigo to be explained and she was passed about all tenderly and expertly like a dressed doll held in the right manner by its firmly stuffed middle for the account she could give she might have been made to give it by pressure of her stomach she might have been expected to articulate with a rare imitation of nature oh yes i m here all the while i m also in my way a solid little fact and i cost originally a great deal of money cost that is my father for my outfit and let in my husband for an amount of pains toward my training that money would scarce represent well she would meet them in some such way and she translated her idea into action after dinner before they dispersed by engaging them all unconventionally almost violently to dine with her in portland place just as they were if they didn t mind the same party which was the party she wanted oh she was going she was going she could feel it afresh it was a good deal as if she had sneezed ten times or had suddenly burst into a comic song there were breaks in the connection as there would be hitches in the process she didn t wholly see yet what they would do for her nor quite how herself she should handle them but she was dancing up and down beneath her propriety with the thought that she had at least begun something she so fairly liked to feel that she was a point for convergence of wonder it wasn t after all either that their wonder so much signified that of the cornered six whom it glimmered before her that she might still live to drive about like a flock of sheep the intensity of her consciousness its sharpest savour was in the theory of her having diverted having as they said captured the attention of amerigo and charlotte at neither of whom all the while did she so much as once look she had pitched them in with the six for that matter so far as they themselves were concerned they had dropped for the succession of minutes out of contact with their function had in short startled and impressed abandoned their post they re paralysed they re paralysed she commented deep within so much it helped her own apprehension to hang together that they should suddenly lose their bearings her grasp of appearances was thus out of proportion to her view of causes but it came to her then and there that if she could only get the facts of appearance straight only jam them down into their place the reasons lurking behind them kept uncertain for the eyes by their wavering and shifting wouldn t perhaps be able to help showing it wasn t of course that the prince and mrs verver marvelled to see her civil to their friends it was rather precisely that civil was just what she wasn t she had so departed from any such custom of delicate approach approach by the permitted note the suggested if the accepted vagueness as would enable the people in question to put her off if they wished and the profit of her plan the effect of the violence she was willing to let it go for was exactly in their being the people in question people she had seemed to be rather shy of before and for whom she suddenly opened her mouth so wide later on we may add with the ground soon covered by her agitated but resolute step it was to cease to matter what people they were or weren t but meanwhile the particular sense of them that she had taken home to night had done her the service of seeming to break the ice where that formation was thickest still more unexpectedly the service might have been the same for her father inasmuch as immediately when everyone had gone he did exactly what she had been waiting for and despairing of and did it as he did everything with a simplicity that left any purpose of sounding him deeper of drawing him out further of going in his own frequent phrase behind what he said nothing whatever to do he brought it out straight made it bravely and beautifully irrelevant save for the plea of what they should lose by breaking the charm i guess we won t go down there after all will we mag just when it s getting so pleasant here that was all with nothing to lead up to it but it was done for her at a stroke and done not less more rather for amerigo and charlotte on whom the immediate effect as she secretly as she almost breathlessly measured it was prodigious everything now so fitted for her to everything else that she could feel the effect as prodigious even while sticking to her policy of giving the pair no look there were thus some five wonderful minutes during which they loomed to her sightless eyes on either side of her larger than they had ever loomed before larger than life larger than thought larger than any danger or any safety there was thus a space of time in fine fairly vertiginous for her during which she took no more account of them than if they were not in the room she had never never treated them in any such way not even just now when she had plied her art upon the matcham band her present manner was an intenser exclusion and the air was charged with their silence while she talked with her other companion as if she had nothing but him to consider he had given her the note amazingly by his allusion to the pleasantness that of such an occasion as his successful dinner which might figure as their bribe for renouncing so that it was all as if they were speaking selfishly counting on a repetition of just such extensions of experience maggie achieved accordingly an act of unprecedented energy threw herself into her father s presence as by the absolute consistency with which she held his eyes saying to herself at the same time that she smiled and talked and inaugurated her system what does he mean by it that s the question what does he mean but studying again all the signs in him that recent anxiety had made familiar and counting the stricken minutes on the part of the others it was in their silence that the others loomed as she felt she had had no measure she afterwards knew of this duration but it drew out and out really to what would have been called in simpler conditions awkwardness as if she herself were stretching the cord ten minutes later however in the homeward carriage to which her husband cutting delay short had proceeded at the first announcement ten minutes later she was to stretch it almost to breaking the prince had permitted her to linger much less before his move to the door than they usually lingered at the gossiping close of such evenings which she all responsive took for a sign of his impatience to modify for her the odd effect of his not having and of charlotte s not having instantly acclaimed the issue of the question debated or more exactly settled before them he had had time to become aware of this possible impression in her and his virtually urging her into the carriage was connected with his feeling that he must take action on the new ground a certain ambiguity in her would absolutely have tormented him but he had already found something to soothe and correct as to which she had on her side a shrewd notion of what it would be she was herself for that matter prepared and she was of a truth as she took her seat in the brougham amazed at her preparation it allowed her scarce an interval she brought it straight out i was certain that was what father would say if i should leave him alone i have been leaving him alone and you see the effect he hates now to move he likes too much to be with us but if you see the effect she felt herself magnificently keeping it up perhaps you don t see the cause the cause my dear is too lovely her husband on taking his place beside her had during a minute or two for her watching sense neither said nor done anything he had been for that sense as if thinking waiting deciding yet it was still before he spoke that he as she felt it to be definitely acted he put his arm round her and drew her close indulged in the demonstration the long firm embrace by his single arm the infinite pressure of her whole person to his own that such opportunities had so often suggested and prescribed held accordingly and as she could but too intimately feel exquisitely solicited she had said the thing she was intending and desiring to say and as to which she felt even more than she felt anything else that whatever he might do she mustn t be irresponsible yes she was in his exerted grasp and she knew what that was but she was at the same time in the grasp of her conceived responsibility and the extraordinary thing was that of the two intensities the second was presently to become the sharper he took his time for it meanwhile but he met her speech after a fashion the cause of your father s deciding not to go yes and of my having wanted to let it act for him quietly i mean without my insistence she had in her compressed state another pause and it made her feel as if she were immensely resisting strange enough was this sense for her and altogether new the sense of possessing by miraculous help some advantage that absolutely then and there in the carriage as they rolled she might either give up or keep strange inexpressibly strange so distinctly she saw that if she did give it up she should somehow give up everything for ever and what her husband s grasp really meant as her very bones registered was that she should give it up it was exactly for this that he had resorted to unfailing magic he knew how to resort to it he could be on occasion as she had lately more than ever learned so munificent a lover all of which was precisely a part of the character she had never ceased to regard in him as princely a part of his large and beautiful ease his genius for charm for intercourse for expression for life she should have but to lay her head back on his shoulder with a certain movement to make it definite for him that she didn t resist to this as they went every throb of her consciousness prompted her every throb that is but one the throb of her deeper need to know where she really was by the time she had uttered the rest of her idea therefore she was still keeping her head and intending to keep it though she was also staring out of the carriage window with eyes into which the tears of suffered pain had risen indistinguishable perhaps happily in the dusk she was making an effort that horribly hurt her and as she couldn t cry out her eyes swam in her silence with them all the same through the square opening beside her through the grey panorama of the london night she achieved the feat of not losing sight of what she wanted and her lips helped and protected her by being able to be gay it s not to leave you my dear for that he ll give up anything just as he would go off anywhere i think you know if you would go with him i mean you and he alone maggie pursued with her gaze out of her window for which amerigo s answer again took him a moment ah the dear old boy you would like me to propose him something well if you think you could bear it and leave the prince asked you and charlotte alone why not maggie had also to wait a minute but when she spoke it came clear why shouldn t charlotte be just one of my reasons my not liking to leave her she has always been so good so perfect to me but never so wonderfully as just now we have somehow been more together thinking for the time almost only of each other it has been quite as in old days and she proceeded consummately for she felt it as consummate it s as if we had been missing each other had got a little apart though going on so side by side but the good moments if one only waits for them she hastened to add come round of themselves moreover you ve seen for yourself since you ve made it up so to father feeling for yourself in your beautiful way every difference every air that blows not having to be told or pushed only being perfect to live with through your habit of kindness and your exquisite instincts but of course you ve seen all the while that both he and i have deeply felt how you ve managed managed that he hasn t been too much alone and that i on my side haven t appeared to what you might call neglect him this is always she continued what i can never bless you enough for of all the good things you ve done for me you ve never done anything better she went on explaining as for the pleasure of explaining even though knowing he must recognise as a part of his easy way too her description of his large liberality your taking the child down yourself those days and your coming each time to bring him away nothing in the world nothing you could have invented would have kept father more under the charm besides you know how you ve always suited him and how you ve always so beautifully let it seem to him that he suits you only it has been these last weeks as if you wished just in order to please him to remind him of it afresh so there it is she wound up it s your doing you ve produced your effect that of his wanting not to be even for a month or two where you re not he doesn t want to bother or bore you that i think you know he never has done and if you ll only give me time i ll come round again to making it my care as always that he shan t but he can t bear you out of his sight she had kept it up and up filling it out crowding it in and all really without difficulty for it was every word of it thanks to a long evolution of feeling what she had been primed to the brim with she made the picture forced it upon him hung it before him remembering happily how he had gone so far one day supported by the principino as to propose the zoo in eaton square to carry with him there on the spot under this pleasant inspiration both his elder and his younger companion with the latter of whom he had taken the tone that they were introducing granddaddy granddaddy nervous and rather funking it to lions and tigers more or less at large touch by touch she thus dropped into her husband s silence the truth about his good nature and his good manners and it was this demonstration of his virtue precisely that added to the strangeness even for herself of her failing as yet to yield to him it would be a question but of the most trivial act of surrender the vibration of a nerve the mere movement of a muscle but the act grew important between them just through her doing perceptibly nothing nothing but talk in the very tone that would naturally have swept her into tenderness she knew more and more every lapsing minute taught her how he might by a single rightness make her cease to watch him that rightness a million miles removed from the queer actual falling so short which would consist of his breaking out to her diviningly indulgently with the last happy inconsequence come away with me somewhere you and then we needn t think we needn t even talk of anything of anyone else five words like that would answer her would break her utterly down but they were the only ones that would so serve she waited for them and there was a supreme instant when by the testimony of all the rest of him she seemed to feel them in his heart and on his lips only they didn t sound and as that made her wait again so it made her more intensely watch this in turn showed her that he too watched and waited and how much he had expected something that he now felt wouldn t come yes it wouldn t come if he didn t answer her if he but said the wrong things instead of the right if he could say the right everything would come it hung by a hair that everything might crystallise for their recovered happiness at his touch this possibility glowed at her however for fifty seconds only then to turn cold and as it fell away from her she felt the chill of reality and knew again all but pressed to his heart and with his breath upon her cheek the slim rigour of her attitude a rigour beyond that of her natural being they had silences at last that were almost crudities of mutual resistance silences that persisted through his felt effort to treat her recurrence to the part he had lately played to interpret all the sweetness of her so talking to him as a manner of making love to him ah it was no such manner heaven knew for maggie she could make love if this had been in question better than that on top of which it came to her presently to say keeping in with what she had already spoken except of course that for the question of going off somewhere he d go readily quite delightedly with you i verily believe he d like to have you for a while to himself do you mean he thinks of proposing it the prince after a moment sounded oh no he doesn t ask as you must so often have seen but i believe he d go like a shot as you say if you were to suggest it it had the air she knew of a kind of condition made and she had asked herself while she spoke if it wouldn t cause his arm to let her go the fact that it didn t suggested to her that she had made him of a sudden still more intensely think think with such concentration that he could do but one thing at once and it was precisely as if the concentration had the next moment been proved in him he took a turn inconsistent with the superficial impression a jump that made light of their approach to gravity and represented for her the need in him to gain time that she made out was his drawback that the warning from her had come to him and had come to charlotte after all too suddenly that they were in face of it rearranging that they had to rearrange was all before her again yet to do as they would like they must enjoy a snatch longer or shorter of recovered independence amerigo for the instant was but doing as he didn t like and it was as if she were watching his effort without disguise what s your father s idea this year then about fawns will he go at whitsuntide and will he then stay on maggie went through the form of thought he will really do i imagine as he has in so many ways so often done before do whatever may seem most agreeable to yourself and there s of course always charlotte to be considered only their going early to fawns if they do go she said needn t in the least entail your and my going ah amerigo echoed it needn t in the least entail your and my going we can do as we like what they may do needn t trouble us since they re by good fortune perfectly happy together oh the prince returned your father s never so happy as with you near him to enjoy his being so well i may enjoy it said maggie but i m not the cause of it you re the cause her husband declared of the greater part of everything that s good among us but she received this tribute in silence and the next moment he pursued if mrs verver has arrears of time with you to make up as you say she ll scarcely do it or you scarcely will by our cutting your and my cutting too loose i see what you mean maggie mused he let her for a little to give her attention to it after which shall i just quite of a sudden he asked propose him a journey maggie hesitated but she brought forth the fruit of reflection it would have the merit that charlotte then would be with me with me i mean so much more also that i shouldn t by choosing such a time for going away seem unconscious and ungrateful seem not to respond seem in fact rather to wish to shake her off i should respond on the contrary very markedly by being here alone with her for a month and would you like to be here alone with her for a month i could do with it beautifully or we might even she said quite gaily go together down to fawns you could be so very content without me the prince presently inquired yes my own dear if you could be content for a while with father that would keep me up i might for the time she went on go to stay there with charlotte or better still she might come to portland place oho said the prince with cheerful vagueness i should feel you see she continued that the two of us were showing the same sort of kindness amerigo thought the two of us charlotte and i maggie again hesitated you and i darling i see i see he promptly took it in and what reason shall i give give i mean your father for asking him to go off why the very simplest if you conscientiously can the desire said maggie to be agreeable to him just that only something in this reply made her husband again reflect conscientiously why shouldn t i conscientiously it wouldn t by your own contention he developed represent any surprise for him i must strike him sufficiently as at the worst the last person in the world to wish to do anything to hurt him ah there it was again for maggie the note already sounded the note of the felt need of not working harm why this precautionary view she asked herself afresh when her father had complained at the very least as little as herself with their stillness together so perfect what had suggested so around them the attitude of sparing them her inner vision fixed it once more this attitude saw it in the others as vivid and concrete extended it straight from her companion to charlotte before she was well aware accordingly she had echoed in this intensity of thought amerigo s last words you re the last person in the world to wish to do anything to hurt him she heard herself heard her tone after she had spoken and heard it the more that for a minute after she felt her husband s eyes on her face very close too close for her to see him he was looking at her because he was struck and looking hard though his answer when it came was straight enough why isn t that just what we have been talking about that i ve affected you as fairly studying his comfort and his pleasure he might show his sense of it the prince went on by proposing to me an excursion and you would go with him maggie immediately asked he hung fire but an instant per dio she also had her pause but she broke it since gaiety was in the air with an intense smile you can say that safely because the proposal s one that of his own motion he won t make she couldn t have narrated afterwards and in fact was at a loss to tell herself by what transition what rather marked abruptness of change in their personal relation their drive came to its end with a kind of interval established almost confessed to between them she felt it in the tone with which he repeated after her safely safely as regards being thrown with him perhaps after all in such a case too long he s a person to think you might easily feel yourself to be so it won t maggie said come from father he s too modest their eyes continued to meet on it from corner to corner of the brougham oh your modesty between you but he still smiled for it so that unless i insist we shall simply go on as we are well we re going on beautifully he answered though by no means with the effect it would have had if their mute transaction that of attempted capture and achieved escape had not taken place as maggie said nothing none the less to gainsay his remark it was open to him to find himself the next moment conscious of still another idea i wonder if it would do i mean for me to break in to break in between your father and his wife but there would be a way he said we can make charlotte ask him and then as maggie herself now wondered echoing it again we can suggest to her to suggest to him that he shall let me take him off oh said maggie then if he asks her why i so suddenly break out she ll be able to tell him the reason they were stopping and the footman who had alighted had rung at the house door that you think it would be so charming that i think it would be so charming that we ve persuaded her will be convincing i see maggie went on while the footman came back to let them out i see she said again though she felt a little disconcerted what she really saw of a sudden was that her stepmother might report her as above all concerned for the proposal and this brought her back her need that her father shouldn t think her concerned in any degree for anything she alighted the next instant with a slight sense of defeat her husband to let her out had passed before her and a little in advance he awaited her on the edge of the low terrace a step high that preceded their open entrance on either side of which one of their servants stood the sense of a life tremendously ordered and fixed rose before her and there was something in amerigo s very face while his eyes again met her own through the dusky lamplight that was like a conscious reminder of it he had answered her just before distinctly and it appeared to leave her nothing to say it was almost as if having planned for the last word she saw him himself enjoying it it was almost as if in the strangest way in the world he were paying her back by the production of a small pang that of a new uneasiness for the way she had slipped from him during their drive xxviii maggie s new uneasiness might have had time to drop inasmuch as she not only was conscious during several days that followed of no fresh indication for it to feed on but was even struck in quite another way with an augmentation of the symptoms of that difference she had taken it into her head to work for she recognised by the end of a week that if she had been in a manner caught up her father had been not less so with the effect of her husband s and his wife s closing in together round them and of their all having suddenly begun as a party of four to lead a life gregarious and from that reason almost hilarious so far as the easy sound of it went as never before it might have been an accident and a mere coincidence so at least she said to herself at first but a dozen chances that furthered the whole appearance had risen to the surface pleasant pretexts oh certainly pleasant as pleasant as amerigo in particular could make them for associated undertakings quite for shared adventures for its always turning out amusingly that they wanted to do very much the same thing at the same time and in the same way funny all this was to some extent in the light of the fact that the father and daughter for so long had expressed so few positive desires yet it would be sufficiently natural that if amerigo and charlotte had at last got a little tired of each other s company they should find their relief not so much in sinking to the rather low level of their companions as in wishing to pull the latter into the train in which they so constantly moved we re in the train maggie mutely reflected after the dinner in eaton square with lady castledean we ve suddenly waked up in it and found ourselves rushing along very much as if we had been put in during sleep shoved like a pair of labelled boxes into the van and since i wanted to go i m certainly going she might have added i m moving without trouble they re doing it all for us it s wonderful how they understand and how perfectly it succeeds for that was the thing she had most immediately to acknowledge it seemed as easy for them to make a quartette as it had formerly so long appeared for them to make a pair of couples this latter being thus a discovery too absurdly belated the only point at which day after day the success appeared at all qualified was represented as might have been said by her irresistible impulse to give her father a clutch when the train indulged in one of its occasional lurches then there was no denying it his eyes and her own met so that they were themselves doing active violence as against the others to that very spirit of union or at least to that very achievement of change which she had taken the field to invoke the maximum of change was reached no doubt the day the matcham party dined in portland place the day really perhaps of maggie s maximum of social glory in the sense of its showing for her own occasion her very own with every one else extravagantly rallying and falling in absolutely conspiring to make her its heroine it was as if her father himself always with more initiative as a guest than as a host had dabbled too in the conspiracy and the impression was not diminished by the presence of the assinghams likewise very much caught up now after something of a lull by the side wind of all the rest of the motion and giving our young woman so far at least as fanny was concerned the sense of some special intention of encouragement and applause fanny who had not been present at the other dinner thanks to a preference entertained and expressed by charlotte made a splendid show at this one in new orange coloured velvet with multiplied turquoises and with a confidence furthermore as different as possible her hostess inferred from her too marked betrayal of a belittled state at matcham maggie was not indifferent to her own opportunity to redress this balance which seemed for the hour part of a general rectification she liked making out for herself that on the high level of portland place a spot exempt on all sorts of grounds from jealous jurisdictions her friend could feel as good as any one and could in fact at moments almost appear to take the lead in recognition and celebration so far as the evening might conduce to intensify the lustre of the little princess mrs assingham produced on her the impression of giving her constantly her cue for this and it was in truth partly by her help intelligently quite gratefully accepted that the little princess in maggie was drawn out and emphasised she couldn t definitely have said how it happened but she felt herself for the first time in her career living up to the public and popular notion of such a personage as it pressed upon her from all round rather wondering inwardly too while she did so at that strange mixture in things through which the popular notion could be evidenced for her by such supposedly great ones of the earth as the castledeans and their kind fanny assingham might really have been there at all events like one of the assistants in the ring at the circus to keep up the pace of the sleek revolving animal on whose back the lady in short spangled skirts should brilliantly caper and posture that was all doubtless maggie had forgotten had neglected had declined to be the little princess on anything like the scale open to her but now that the collective hand had been held out to her with such alacrity so that she might skip up into the light even as seemed to her modest mind with such a show of pink stocking and such an abbreviation of white petticoat she could strike herself as perceiving under arched eyebrows where her mistake had been she had invited for the later hours after her dinner a fresh contingent the whole list of her apparent london acquaintance which was again a thing in the manner of little princesses for whom the princely art was a matter of course that was what she was learning to do to fill out as a matter of course her appointed her expected her imposed character and though there were latent considerations that somewhat interfered with the lesson she was having to night an inordinate quantity of practice none of it so successful as when quite wittingly she directed it at lady castledean who was reduced by it at last to an unprecedented state of passivity the perception of this high result caused mrs assingham fairly to flush with responsive joy she glittered at her young friend from moment to moment quite feverishly it was positively as if her young friend had in some marvellous sudden supersubtle way become a source of succour to herself become beautifully divinely retributive the intensity of the taste of these registered phenomena was in fact that somehow by a process and through a connexion not again to be traced she so practised at the same time on amerigo and charlotte with only the drawback her constant check and second thought that she concomitantly practised perhaps still more on her father this last was a danger indeed that for much of the ensuing time had its hours of strange beguilement those at which her sense for precautions so suffered itself to lapse that she felt her communion with him more intimate than any other it couldn t but pass between them that something singular was happening so much as this she again and again said to herself whereby the comfort of it was there after all to be noted just as much as the possible peril and she could think of the couple they formed together as groping with sealed lips but with mutual looks that had never been so tender for some freedom some fiction some figured bravery under which they might safely talk of it the moment was to come and it finally came with an effect as penetrating as the sound that follows the pressure of an electric button when she read the least helpful of meanings into the agitation she had created the merely specious description of their case would have been that after being for a long time as a family delightfully uninterruptedly happy they had still had a new felicity to discover a felicity for which blessedly her father s appetite and her own in particular had been kept fresh and grateful this livelier march of their intercourse as a whole was the thing that occasionally determined in him the clutching instinct we have glanced at very much as if he had said to her in default of her breaking silence first everything is remarkably pleasant isn t it but where for it after all are we up in a balloon and whirling through space or down in the depths of the earth in the glimmering passages of a gold mine the equilibrium the precious condition lasted in spite of rearrangement there had been a fresh distribution of the different weights but the balance persisted and triumphed all of which was just the reason why she was forbidden face to face with the companion of her adventure the experiment of a test if they balanced they balanced she had to take that it deprived her of every pretext for arriving by however covert a process at what he thought but she had her hours thus of feeling supremely linked to him by the rigour of their law and when it came over her that all the while the wish on his side to spare her might be what most worked with him this very fact of their seeming to have nothing inward really to talk about wrapped him up for her in a kind of sweetness that was wanting as a consecration even in her yearning for her husband she was powerless however was only more utterly hushed when the interrupting flash came when she would have been all ready to say to him yes this is by every appearance the best time we ve had yet but don t you see all the same how they must be working together for it and how my very success my success in shifting our beautiful harmony to a new basis comes round to being their success above all their cleverness their amiability their power to hold out their complete possession in short of our life for how could she say as much as that without saying a great deal more without saying they ll do everything in the world that suits us save only one thing prescribe a line for us that will make them separate how could she so much as imagine herself even faintly murmuring that without putting into his mouth the very words that would have made her quail separate my dear do you want them to separate then you want us to you and me for how can the one separation take place without the other that was the question that in spirit she had heard him ask with its dread train moreover of involved and connected inquiries their own separation his and hers was of course perfectly thinkable but only on the basis of the sharpest of reasons well the sharpest the very sharpest would be that they could no longer afford as it were he to let his wife she to let her husband run them in such compact formation and say they accepted this account of their situation as a practical finality acting upon it and proceeding to a division would no sombre ghosts of the smothered past on either side show across the widening strait pale unappeased faces or raise in the very passage deprecating denouncing hands meanwhile however such things might be she was to have occasion to say to herself that there might be but a deeper treachery in recoveries and reassurances she was to feel alone again as she had felt at the issue of her high tension with her husband during their return from meeting the castledeans in eaton square the evening in question had left her with a larger alarm but then a lull had come the alarm after all was yet to be confirmed there came an hour inevitably when she knew with a chill what she had feared and why it had taken this hour a month to arrive but to find it before her was thoroughly to recognise it for it showed her sharply what amerigo had meant in alluding to a particular use that they might make for their reaffirmed harmony and prosperity of charlotte the more she thought at present of the tone he had employed to express their enjoyment of this resource the more it came back to her as the product of a conscious art of dealing with her he had been conscious at the moment of many things conscious even not a little of desiring and thereby of needing to see what she would do in a given case the given case would be that of her being to a certain extent as she might fairly make it out menaced horrible as it was to impute to him any intention represented by such a word why it was that to speak of making her stepmother intervene as they might call it in a question that seemed just then and there quite peculiarly their own business why it was that a turn so familiar and so easy should at the worst strike her as charged with the spirit of a threat was an oddity disconnected for her temporarily from its grounds the adventure of an imagination within her that possibly had lost its way that precisely was doubtless why she had learned to wait as the weeks passed by with a fair or rather indeed with an excessive imitation of resumed serenity there had been no prompt sequel to the prince s equivocal light and that made for patience yet she was none the less to have to admit after delay that the bread he had cast on the waters had come home and that she should thus be justified of her old apprehension the consequence of this in turn was a renewed pang in presence of his remembered ingenuity to be ingenious with her what didn t what mightn t that mean when she had so absolutely never at any point of contact with him put him by as much as the value of a penny to the expense of sparing doubting fearing her of having in any way whatever to reckon with her the ingenuity had been in his simply speaking of their use of charlotte as if it were common to them in an equal degree and his triumph on the occasion had been just in the simplicity she couldn t and he knew it say what was true oh you use her and i use her if you will yes but we use her ever so differently and separately not at all in the same way or degree there s nobody we really use together but ourselves don t you see by which i mean that where our interests are the same i can so beautifully so exquisitely serve you for everything and you can so beautifully so exquisitely serve me the only person either of us needs is the other of us so why as a matter of course in such a case as this drag in charlotte she couldn t so challenge him because it would have been and there she was paralysed the note it would have translated itself on the spot for his ear into jealousy and from reverberation to repercussion would have reached her father s exactly in the form of a cry piercing the stillness of peaceful sleep it had been for many days almost as difficult for her to catch a quiet twenty minutes with her father as it had formerly been easy there had been in fact of old the time so strangely seemed already far away an inevitability in her longer passages with him a sort of domesticated beauty in the calculability round about them of everything but at present charlotte was almost always there when amerigo brought her to eaton square where amerigo was constantly bringing her and amerigo was almost always there when charlotte brought her husband to portland place where charlotte was constantly bringing him the fractions of occasions the chance minutes that put them face to face had as yet of late contrived to count but little between them either for the sense of opportunity or for that of exposure inasmuch as the lifelong rhythm of their intercourse made against all cursory handling of deep things they had never availed themselves of any given quarter of an hour to gossip about fundamentals they moved slowly through large still spaces they could be silent together at any time beautifully with much more comfort than hurriedly expressive it appeared indeed to have become true that their common appeal measured itself for vividness just by this economy of sound they might have been talking at each other when they talked with their companions but these latter assuredly were not in any directer way to gain light on the current phase of their relation such were some of the reasons for which maggie suspected fundamentals as i have called them to be rising by a new movement to the surface suspected it one morning late in may when her father presented himself in portland place alone he had his pretext of that she was fully aware the principino two days before had shown signs happily not persistent of a feverish cold and had notoriously been obliged to spend the interval at home this was ground ample ground for punctual inquiry but what it wasn t ground for she quickly found herself reflecting was his having managed in the interest of his visit to dispense so unwontedly as their life had recently come to be arranged with his wife s attendance it had so happened that she herself was for the hour exempt from her husband s and it will at once be seen that the hour had a quality all its own when i note that remembering how the prince had looked in to say he was going out the princess whimsically wondered if their respective sposi mightn t frankly be meeting whimsically hoped indeed they were temporarily so disposed of strange was her need at moments to think of them as not attaching an excessive importance to their repudiation of the general practice that had rested only a few weeks before on such a consecrated rightness repudiations surely were not in the air they had none of them come to that for wasn t she at this minute testifying directly against them by her own behaviour when she should confess to fear of being alone with her father to fear of what he might then ah with such a slow painful motion as she had a horror of say to her then would be time enough for amerigo and charlotte to confess to not liking to appear to foregather she had this morning a wonderful consciousness both of dreading a particular question from him and of being able to check yes even to disconcert magnificently by her apparent manner of receiving it any restless imagination he might have about its importance the day bright and soft had the breath of summer it made them talk to begin with of fawns of the way fawns invited maggie aware the while that in thus regarding with him the sweetness of its invitation to one couple just as much as to another her humbugging smile grew very nearly convulsive that was it and there was relief truly of a sort in taking it in she was humbugging him already by absolute necessity as she had never never done in her life doing it up to the full height of what she had allowed for the necessity in the great dimly shining room where declining for his reasons to sit down he moved about in amerigo s very footsteps the necessity affected her as pressing upon her with the very force of the charm itself of the old pleasantness between them so candidly playing up there again of the positive flatness of their tenderness a surface all for familiar use quite as if generalised from the long succession of tapestried sofas sweetly faded on which his theory of contentment had sat through unmeasured pauses beside her own she knew from this instant knew in advance and as well as anything would ever teach her that she must never intermit for a solitary second her so highly undertaking to prove that there was nothing the matter with her she saw of a sudden everything she might say or do in the light of that undertaking established connections from it with any number of remote matters struck herself for instance as acting all in its interest when she proposed their going out in the exercise of their freedom and in homage to the season for a turn in the regent s park this resort was close at hand at the top of portland place and the principino beautifully better had already proceeded there under high attendance all of which considerations were defensive for maggie all of which became to her mind part of the business of cultivating continuity upstairs while she left him to put on something to go out in the thought of his waiting below for her in possession of the empty house brought with it sharply if briefly one of her abrupt arrests of consistency the brush of a vain imagination almost paralysing her often for the minute before her glass the vivid look in other words of the particular difference his marriage had made the particular difference seemed at such instants the loss more than anything else of their old freedom their never having had to think where they were together concerned of any one of anything but each other it hadn t been her marriage that did it that had never for three seconds suggested to either of them that they must act diplomatically must reckon with another presence no not even with her husband s she groaned to herself while the vain imagination lasted why did he marry ah why did he and then it came up to her more than ever that nothing could have been more beautiful than the way in which till charlotte came so much more closely into their life amerigo hadn t interfered what she had gone on owing him for this mounted up again to her eyes like a column of figures or call it even if one would a house of cards it was her father s wonderful act that had tipped the house down and made the sum wrong with all of which immediately after her question her why did he why did he rushed back inevitably the confounding the overwhelming wave of the knowledge of his reason he did it for me he did it for me she moaned he did it exactly that our freedom meaning beloved man simply and solely mine should be greater instead of less he did it divinely to liberate me so far as possible from caring what became of him she found time upstairs even in her haste as she had repeatedly found time before to let the wonderments involved in these recognitions flash at her with their customary effect of making her blink the question in especial of whether she might find her solution in acting herself in the spirit of what he had done in forcing her care really to grow as much less as he had tried to make it thus she felt the whole weight of their case drop afresh upon her shoulders was confronted unmistakably with the prime source of her haunted state it all came from her not having been able not to mind not to mind what became of him not having been able without anxiety to let him go his way and take his risk and lead his life she had made anxiety her stupid little idol and absolutely now while she stuck a long pin a trifle fallaciously into her hat she had with an approach to irritation told her maid a new woman whom she had lately found herself thinking of as abysmal that she didn t want her she tried to focus the possibility of some understanding between them in consequence of which he should cut loose very near indeed it looked any such possibility that consciousness too had taken its turn by the time she was ready all the vibration all the emotion of this present passage being precisely in the very sweetness of their lapse back into the conditions of the simpler time into a queer resemblance between the aspect and the feeling of the moment and those of numberless other moments that were sufficiently far away she had been quick in her preparation in spite of the flow of the tide that sometimes took away her breath but a pause once more was still left for her to make a pause at the top of the stairs before she came down to him in the span of which she asked herself if it weren t thinkable from the perfectly practical point of view that she should simply sacrifice him she didn t go into the detail of what sacrificing him would mean she didn t need to so distinct was it in one of her restless lights that there he was awaiting her that she should find him walking up and down the drawing room in the warm fragrant air to which the open windows and the abundant flowers contributed slowly and vaguely moving there and looking very slight and young and superficially manageable almost as much like her child putting it a little freely as like her parent with the appearance about him above all of having perhaps arrived just on purpose to say it to her himself in so many words sacrifice me my own love do sacrifice me do sacrifice me should she want to should she insist on it she might verily hear him bleating it at her all conscious and all accommodating like some precious spotless exceptionally intelligent lamb the positive effect of the intensity of this figure however was to make her shake it away in her resumed descent and after she had rejoined him after she had picked him up she was to know the full pang of the thought that her impossibility was made absolutely by his consciousness by the lucidity of his intention this she felt while she smiled there for him again all hypocritically while she drew on fair fresh gloves while she interrupted the process first to give his necktie a slightly smarter twist and then to make up to him for her hidden madness by rubbing her nose into his cheek according to the tradition of their frankest levity from the instant she should be able to convict him of intending every issue would be closed and her hypocrisy would have to redouble the only way to sacrifice him would be to do so without his dreaming what it might be for she kissed him she arranged his cravat she dropped remarks she guided him out she held his arm not to be led but to lead him and taking it to her by much the same intimate pressure she had always used when a little girl to mark the inseparability of her doll she did all these things so that he should sufficiently fail to dream of what they might be for xxix there was nothing to show that her effort in any degree fell short till they got well into the park and he struck her as giving unexpectedly the go by to any serious search for the principino the way they sat down awhile in the sun was a sign of that his dropping with her into the first pair of sequestered chairs they came across and waiting a little after they were placed as if now at last she might bring out as between them something more specific it made her but feel the more sharply how the specific in almost any direction was utterly forbidden her how the use of it would be for all the world like undoing the leash of a dog eager to follow up a scent it would come out the specific where the dog would come out would run to earth somehow the truth for she was believing herself in relation to the truth at which she mustn t so much as indirectly point such at any rate was the fashion in which her passionate prudence played over possibilities of danger reading symptoms and betrayals into everything she looked at and yet having to make it evident while she recognised them that she didn t wince there were moments between them in their chairs when he might have been watching her guard herself and trying to think of something new that would trip her up there were pauses during which with her affection as sweet and still as the sunshine she might yet as at some hard game over a table for money have been defying him to fasten upon her the least little complication of consciousness she was positively proud afterwards of the great style in which she had kept this up later on at the hour s end when they had retraced their steps to find amerigo and charlotte awaiting them at the house she was able to say to herself that truly she had put her plan through even though once more setting herself the difficult task of making their relation every minute of the time not fall below the standard of that other hour in the treasured past which hung there behind them like a framed picture in a museum a high watermark for the history of their old fortune the summer evening in the park at fawns when side by side under the trees just as now they had let their happy confidence lull them with its most golden tone there had been the possibility of a trap for her at present in the very question of their taking up anew that residence wherefore she had not been the first to sound it in spite of the impression from him of his holding off to see what she would do she was saying to herself in secret can we again in this form migrate there can i for myself undertake it face all the intenser keeping up and stretching out indefinitely impossibly that our conditions in the country as we ve established and accepted them would stand for she had positively lost herself in this inward doubt so much she was subsequently to remember but remembering then too that her companion though perceptibly perhaps as if not to be eager had broken the ice very much as he had broken it in eaton square after the banquet to the castledeans her mind had taken a long excursion wandered far into the vision of what a summer at fawns with amerigo and charlotte still more eminently in presence against that higher sky would bring forth wasn t her father meanwhile only pretending to talk of it just as she was in a manner pretending to listen he got off it finally at all events for the transition it couldn t well help thrusting out at him it had amounted exactly to an arrest of her private excursion by the sense that he had begun to imitate oh as never yet the ancient tone of gold it had verily come from him at last the question of whether she thought it would be very good but very good indeed that he should leave england for a series of weeks on some pretext with the prince then it had been that she was to know her husband s menace hadn t really dropped since she was face to face with the effect of it ah the effect of it had occupied all the rest of their walk had stayed out with them and come home with them besides making it impossible that they shouldn t presently feign to recollect how rejoining the child had been their original purpose maggie s uneffaced note was that it had at the end of five minutes more driven them to that endeavour as to a refuge and caused them afterwards to rejoice as well that the boy s irrepressibly importunate company in due course secured and enjoyed with the extension imparted by his governess a person expectant of consideration constituted a cover for any awkwardness for that was what it had all come to that the dear man had spoken to her to try her quite as he had been spoken to himself by charlotte with the same fine idea the princess took it in on the spot firmly grasping it she heard them together her father and his wife dealing with the queer case the prince tells me that maggie has a plan for your taking some foreign journey with him and as he likes to do everything she wants he has suggested my speaking to you for it as the thing most likely to make you consent so i do speak see being always so eager myself as you know to meet maggie s wishes i speak but without quite understanding this time what she has in her head why should she of a sudden at this particular moment desire to ship you off together and to remain here alone with me the compliment s all to me i admit and you must decide quite as you like the prince is quite ready evidently to do his part but you ll have it out with him that is you ll have it out with her something of that kind was what in her mind s ear maggie heard and this after his waiting for her to appeal to him directly was her father s invitation to her to have it out well as she could say to herself all the rest of the day that was what they did while they continued to sit there in their penny chairs that was what they had done as much as they would now ever ever have out anything the measure of this at least had been given that each would fight to the last for the protection for the perversion of any real anxiety she had confessed instantly with her humbugging grin not flinching by a hair meeting his eyes as mildly as he met hers she had confessed to her fancy that they might both he and his son in law have welcomed such an escapade since they had both been so long so furiously domestic she had almost cocked her hat under the inspiration of this opportunity to hint how a couple of spirited young men reacting from confinement and sallying forth arm in arm might encounter the agreeable in forms that would strike them for the time at least as novel she had felt for fifty seconds with her eyes all so sweetly and falsely in her companion s horribly vulgar yet without minding it either such luck should she have if to be nothing worse than vulgar would see her through and i thought amerigo might like it better she had said than wandering off alone do you mean that he won t go unless i take him she had considered here and never in her life had she considered so promptly and so intently if she really put it that way her husband challenged might belie the statement so that what would that do but make her father wonder make him perhaps ask straight out why she was exerting pressure she couldn t of course afford to be suspected for an instant of exerting pressure which was why she was obliged only to make answer wouldn t that be just what you must have out with him decidedly if he makes me the proposal but he hasn t made it yet oh once more how she was to feel she had smirked perhaps he s too shy because you re so sure he so really wants my company i think he has thought you might like it well i should but with this he looked away from her and she held her breath to hear him either ask if she wished him to address the question to amerigo straight or inquire if she should be greatly disappointed by his letting it drop what had settled her as she was privately to call it was that he had done neither of these things and had thereby markedly stood off from the risk involved in trying to draw out her reason to attenuate on the other hand this appearance and quite as if to fill out the too large receptacle made so musingly by his abstention he had himself presently given her a reason had positively spared her the effort of asking whether he judged charlotte not to have approved he had taken everything on himself that was what had settled her she had had to wait very little more to feel with this how much he was taking the point he made was his lack of any eagerness to put time and space on any such scale between himself and his wife he wasn t so unhappy with her far from it and maggie was to hold that he had grinned back paternally through his rather shielding glasses in easy emphasis of this as to be able to hint that he required the relief of absence therefore unless it was for the prince himself oh i don t think it would have been for amerigo himself amerigo and i maggie had said perfectly rub on together well then there we are i see and she had again with sublime blandness assented there we are charlotte and i too her father had gaily proceeded perfectly rub on together and then he had appeared for a little to be making time to put it only so he had mildly and happily added to put it only so he had spoken as if he might easily put it much better yet as if the humour of contented understatement fairly sufficed for the occasion he had played then either all consciously or all unconsciously into charlotte s hands and the effect of this was to render trebly oppressive maggie s conviction of charlotte s plan she had done what she wanted his wife had which was also what amerigo had made her do she had kept her test maggie s test from becoming possible and had applied instead a test of her own it was exactly as if she had known that her stepdaughter would be afraid to be summoned to say under the least approach to cross examination why any change was desirable and it was for our young woman herself still more prodigiously as if her father had been capable of calculations to match of judging it important he shouldn t be brought to demand of her what was the matter with her why otherwise with such an opportunity hadn t he demanded it always from calculation that was why that was why he was terrified of the retort he might have invoked what my dear if you come to that is the matter with you when a minute later on he had followed up his last note by a touch or two designed still further to conjure away the ghost of the anomalous at that climax verily she would have had to be dumb to the question there seems a kind of charm doesn t there on our life and quite as if just lately it had got itself somehow renewed had waked up refreshed a kind of wicked selfish prosperity perhaps as if we had grabbed everything fixed everything down to the last lovely object for the last glass case of the last corner left over of my old show that s the only take off that it has made us perhaps lazy a wee bit languid lying like gods together all careless of mankind do you consider that we re languid that form of rejoinder she had jumped at for the sake of its pretty lightness do you consider that we are careless of mankind living as we do in the biggest crowd in the world and running about always pursued and pursuing it had made him think indeed a little longer than she had meant but he came up again as she might have said smiling well i don t know we get nothing but the fun do we no she had hastened to declare we certainly get nothing but the fun we do it all he had remarked so beautifully we do it all so beautifully she hadn t denied this for a moment i see what you mean well i mean too he had gone on that we haven t no doubt enough the sense of difficulty enough enough for what enough not to be selfish i don t think you are selfish she had returned and had managed not to wail it i don t say that it s me particularly or that it s you or charlotte or amerigo but we re selfish together we move as a selfish mass you see we want always the same thing he had gone on and that holds us that binds us together we want each other he had further explained only wanting it each time for each other that s what i call the happy spell but it s also a little possibly the immorality the immorality she had pleasantly echoed well we re tremendously moral for ourselves that is for each other and i won t pretend that i know exactly at whose particular personal expense you and i for instance are happy what it comes to i daresay is that there s something haunting as if it were a bit uncanny in such a consciousness of our general comfort and privilege unless indeed he had rambled on it s only i to whom fantastically it says so much that s all i mean at any rate that it s sort of soothing as if we were sitting about on divans with pigtails smoking opium and seeing visions let us then be up and doing what is it longfellow says that seems sometimes to ring out like the police breaking in into our opium den to give us a shake but the beauty of it is at the same time that we are doing we re doing that is after all what we went in for we re working it our life our chance whatever you may call it as we saw it as we felt it from the first we have worked it and what more can you do than that it s a good deal for me he had wound up to have made charlotte so happy to have so perfectly contented her you from a good way back were a matter of course i mean your being all right so that i needn t mind your knowing that my great interest since then has rather inevitably been in making sure of the same success very much to your advantage as well for charlotte if we ve worked our life our idea really as i say if at any rate i can sit here and say that i ve worked my share of it it has not been what you may call least by our having put charlotte so at her ease that has been soothing all round that has curled up as the biggest of the blue fumes or whatever they are of the opium don t you see what a cropper we would have come if she hadn t settled down as she has and he had concluded by turning to maggie as for something she mightn t really have thought of you darling in that case i verily believe would have been the one to hate it most to hate it maggie had wondered to hate our having with our tremendous intentions not brought it off and i daresay i should have hated it for you even more than for myself that s not unlikely perhaps when it was for me after all that you did it he had hesitated but only a moment i never told you so well charlotte herself soon enough told me but i never told her her father had answered are you very sure she had presently asked well i like to think how thoroughly i was taken with her and how right i was and how fortunate to have that for my basis i told her all the good i thought of her then that maggie had returned was precisely part of the good i mean it was precisely part of it that she could so beautifully understand yes understand everything everything and in particular your reasons her telling me that showed me how she had understood they were face to face again now and she saw she had made his colour rise it was as if he were still finding in her eyes the concrete image the enacted scene of her passage with charlotte which he was now hearing of for the first time and as to which it would have been natural he should question her further his forbearance to do so would but mark precisely the complication of his fears what she does like he finally said is the way it has succeeded your marriage yes my whole idea the way i ve been justified that s the joy i give her if for her either it had failed that however was not worth talking about he had broken off you think then you could now risk fawns risk it well morally from the point of view i was talking of that of our sinking deeper into sloth our selfishness somehow seems at its biggest down there maggie had allowed him the amusement of her not taking this up is charlotte she had simply asked really ready oh if you and i and amerigo are whenever one corners charlotte he had developed more at his ease one finds that she only wants to know what we want which is what we got her for what we got her for exactly and so for a little even though with a certain effect of oddity in their more or less successful ease they left it left it till maggie made the remark that it was all the same wonderful her stepmother should be willing before the season was out to exchange so much company for so much comparative solitude ah he had then made answer that s because her idea i think this time is that we shall have more people more than we ve hitherto had in the country don t you remember that that originally was what we were to get her for oh yes to give us a life maggie had gone through the form of recalling this and the light of their ancient candour shining from so far back had seemed to bring out some things so strangely that with the sharpness of the vision she had risen to her feet well with a life fawns will certainly do he had remained in his place while she looked over his head the picture in her vision had suddenly swarmed the vibration was that of one of the lurches of the mystic train in which with her companion she was travelling but she was having to steady herself this time before meeting his eyes she had measured indeed the full difference between the move to fawns because each of them now knew the others wanted it and the pairing off for a journey of her husband and her father which nobody knew that either wanted more company at fawns would be effectually enough the key in which her husband and her stepmother were at work there was truly no question but that she and her father must accept any array of visitors no one could try to marry him now what he had just said was a direct plea for that and what was the plea itself but an act of submission to charlotte he had from his chair been noting her look but he had the next minute also risen and then it was they had reminded each other of their having come out for the boy their junction with him and with his companion successfully effected the four had moved home more slowly and still more vaguely yet with a vagueness that permitted of maggie s reverting an instant to the larger issue if we have people in the country then as you were saying do you know for whom my first fancy would be you may be amused but it would be for the castledeans i see but why should i be amused well i mean i am myself i don t think i like her and yet i like to see her which as amerigo says is rum but don t you feel she s very handsome her father inquired yes but it isn t for that then what is it for simply that she may be there just there before us it s as if she may have a value as if something may come of her i don t in the least know what and she rather irritates me meanwhile i don t even know i admit why but if we see her often enough i may find out does it matter so very much her companion had asked while they moved together she had hesitated you mean because you do rather like her he on his side too had waited a little but then he had taken it from her yes i guess i do rather like her which she accepted for the first case she could recall of their not being affected by a person in the same way it came back therefore to his pretending but she had gone far enough and to add to her appearance of levity she further observed that though they were so far from a novelty she should also immediately desire at fawns the presence of the assinghams that put everything on a basis independent of explanations yet it was extraordinary at the same time how much once in the country again with the others she was going as they used to say at home to need the presence of the good fanny it was the strangest thing in the world but it was as if mrs assingham might in a manner mitigate the intensity of her consciousness of charlotte it was as if the two would balance one against the other as if it came round again in that fashion to her idea of the equilibrium it would be like putting this friend into her scale to make weight into the scale with her father and herself amerigo and charlotte would be in the other therefore it would take the three of them to keep that one straight and as this played all duskily in her mind it had received from her father with a sound of suddenness a luminous contribution ah rather do let s have the assinghams it would be to have them she had said as we used so much to have them for a good long stay in the old way and on the old terms as regular boarders fanny used to call it that is if they ll come as regular boarders on the old terms that s what i should like too but i guess they ll come her companion had added in a tone into which she had read meanings the main meaning was that he felt he was going to require them quite as much as she was his recognition of the new terms as different from the old what was that practically but a confession that something had happened and a perception that interested in the situation she had helped to create mrs assingham would be by so much as this concerned in its inevitable development it amounted to an intimation off his guard that he should be thankful for some one to turn to if she had wished covertly to sound him he had now in short quite given himself away and if she had even at the start needed anything more to settle her here assuredly was enough he had hold of his small grandchild as they retraced their steps swinging the boy s hand and not bored as he never was by his always bristling like a fat little porcupine with shrill interrogation points so that secretly while they went she had wondered again if the equilibrium mightn t have been more real mightn t above all have demanded less strange a study had it only been on the books that charlotte should give him a principino of his own she had repossessed herself now of his other arm only this time she was drawing him back gently helplessly back to what they had tried for the hour to get away from just as he was consciously drawing the child and as high miss bogle on her left representing the duties of home was complacently drawing her the duties of home when the house in portland place reappeared showed even from a distance as vividly there before them amerigo and charlotte had come in that is amerigo had charlotte rather having come out and the pair were perched together in the balcony he bare headed she divested of her jacket her mantle or whatever but crowned with a brilliant brave hat responsive to the balmy day which maggie immediately spotted as new as insuperably original as worn in characteristic generous harmony for the first time all evidently to watch for the return of the absent to be there to take them over again as punctually as possible they were gay they were amused in the pleasant morning they leaned across the rail and called down their greeting lighting up the front of the great black house with an expression that quite broke the monotony that might almost have shocked the decency of portland place the group on the pavement stared up as at the peopled battlements of a castle even miss bogle who carried her head most aloft gaped a little through the interval of space as toward truly superior beings there could scarce have been so much of the open mouth since the dingy waits on christmas eve had so lamentably chanted for pennies the time when amerigo insatiable for english customs had come out with a gasped santissima vergine to marvel at the depositaries of this tradition and purchase a reprieve maggie s individual gape was inevitably again for the thought of how the pair would be at work xxx she had not again for weeks had mrs assingham so effectually in presence as on the afternoon of that lady s return from the easter party at matcham but the intermission was made up as soon as the date of the migration to fawns that of the more or less simultaneous adjournment of the two houses began to be discussed it had struck her promptly that this renewal with an old friend of the old terms she had talked of with her father was the one opening for her spirit that wouldn t too much advertise or betray her even her father who had always as he would have said believed in their ancient ally wouldn t necessarily suspect her of invoking fanny s aid toward any special inquiry and least of all if fanny would only act as fanny so easily might maggie s measure of fanny s ease would have been agitating to mrs assingham had it been all at once revealed to her as for that matter it was soon destined to become even on a comparatively graduated showing our young woman s idea in particular was that her safety her escape from being herself suspected of suspicion would proceed from this friend s power to cover to protect and as might be even showily to represent her represent that is her relation to the form of the life they were all actually leading this would doubtless be as people said a large order but that mrs assingham existed substantially or could somehow be made prevailingly to exist for her private benefit was the finest flower maggie had plucked from among the suggestions sown like abundant seed on the occasion of the entertainment offered in portland place to the matcham company mrs assingham that night rebounding from dejection had bristled with bravery and sympathy she had then absolutely she had perhaps recklessly for herself betrayed the deeper and darker consciousness an impression it would now be late for her inconsistently to attempt to undo it was with a wonderful air of giving out all these truths that the princess at present approached her again making doubtless at first a sufficient scruple of letting her know what in especial she asked of her yet not a bit ashamed as she in fact quite expressly declared of fanny s discerned foreboding of the strange uses she might perhaps have for her quite from the first really maggie said extraordinary things to her such as you can help me you know my dear when nobody else can such as i almost wish upon my word that you had something the matter with you that you had lost your health or your money or your reputation forgive me love so that i might be with you as much as i want or keep you with me without exciting comment without exciting any other remark than that such kindnesses are like me we have each our own way of making up for our unselfishness and maggie who had no small self at all as against her husband or her father and only a weak and uncertain one as against her stepmother would verily at this crisis have seen mrs assingham s personal life or liberty sacrificed without a pang the attitude that the appetite in question maintained in her was to draw peculiar support moreover from the current aspects and agitations of her victim this personage struck her in truth as ready for almost anything as not perhaps effusively protesting yet as wanting with a restlessness of her own to know what she wanted and in the long run which was none so long either there was to be no difficulty as happened about that it was as if for all the world maggie had let her see that she held her that she made her fairly responsible for something not to begin with dotting all the i s nor hooking together all the links but treating her without insistence rather with caressing confidence as there to see and to know to advise and to assist the theory visibly had patched itself together for her that the dear woman had somehow from the early time had a hand in all their fortunes so that there was no turn of their common relations and affairs that couldn t be traced back in some degree to her original affectionate interest on this affectionate interest the good lady s young friend now built before her eyes very much as a wise or even as a mischievous child playing on the floor might pile up blocks skilfully and dizzily with an eye on the face of a covertly watching elder when the blocks tumbled down they but acted after the nature of blocks yet the hour would come for their rising so high that the structure would have to be noticed and admired mrs assingham s appearance of unreservedly giving herself involved meanwhile on her own side no separate recognitions her face of almost anxious attention was directed altogether to her young friend s so vivid felicity it suggested that she took for granted at the most certain vague recent enhancements of that state if the princess now more than before was going and going she was prompt to publish that she beheld her go that she had always known she would sooner or later and that any appeal for participation must more or less contain and invite the note of triumph there was a blankness in her blandness assuredly and very nearly an extravagance in her generalising gaiety a precipitation of cheer particularly marked whenever they met again after short separations meetings during the first flush of which maggie sometimes felt reminded of other looks in other faces of two strangely unobliterated impressions above all the physiognomic light that had played out in her husband at the shock she had come at last to talk to herself of the shock of his first vision of her on his return from matcham and gloucester and the wonder of charlotte s beautiful bold wavering gaze when the next morning in eaton square this old friend had turned from the window to begin to deal with her if she had dared to think of it so crudely she would have said that fanny was afraid of her afraid of something she might say or do even as for their few brief seconds amerigo and charlotte had been which made exactly an expressive element common to the three the difference however was that this look had in the dear woman its oddity of a constant renewal whereas it had never for the least little instant again peeped out of the others other looks other lights radiant and steady with the others had taken its place reaching a climax so short a time ago that morning of the appearance of the pair on the balcony of her house to overlook what she had been doing with her father when their general interested brightness and beauty attuned to the outbreak of summer had seemed to shed down warmth and welcome and the promise of protection they were conjoined not to do anything to startle her and now at last so completely that with experience and practice they had almost ceased to fear their liability mrs assingham on the other hand deprecating such an accident not less had yet less assurance as having less control the high pitch of her cheer accordingly the tentative adventurous expressions of the would be smiling order that preceded her approach even like a squad of skirmishers or whatever they were called moving ahead of the baggage train these things had at the end of a fortnight brought a dozen times to our young woman s lips a challenge that had the cunning to await its right occasion but of the relief of which as a demonstration she meanwhile felt no little need you ve such a dread of my possibly complaining to you that you keep pealing all the bells to drown my voice but don t cry out my dear till you re hurt and above all ask yourself how i can be so wicked as to complain what in the name of all that s fantastic can you dream that i have to complain of such inquiries the princess temporarily succeeded in repressing and she did so in a measure by the aid of her wondering if this ambiguity with which her friend affected her wouldn t be at present a good deal like the ambiguity with which she herself must frequently affect her father she wondered how she should enjoy on his part such a take up as she but just succeeded from day to day in sparing mrs assingham and that made for her trying to be as easy with this associate as mr verver blessed man all indulgent but all inscrutable was with his daughter she had extracted from her none the less a vow in respect to the time that if the colonel might be depended on they would spend at fawns and nothing came home to her more in this connection or inspired her with a more intimate interest than her sense of absolutely seeing her interlocutress forbear to observe that charlotte s view of a long visit even from such allies was there to be reckoned with fanny stood off from that proposition as visibly to the princess and as consciously to herself as she might have backed away from the edge of a chasm into which she feared to slip a truth that contributed again to keep before our young woman her own constant danger of advertising her subtle processes that charlotte should have begun to be restrictive about the assinghams which she had never and for a hundred obviously good reasons been before this in itself was a fact of the highest value for maggie and of a value enhanced by the silence in which fanny herself so much too unmistakably dressed it what gave it quite thrillingly its price was exactly the circumstance that it thus opposed her to her stepmother more actively if she was to back up her friends for holding out than she had ever yet been opposed though of course with the involved result of the fine chance given mrs verver to ask her husband for explanations ah from the moment she should be definitely caught in opposition there would be naturally no saying how much charlotte s opportunities might multiply what would become of her father she hauntedly asked if his wife on the one side should begin to press him to call his daughter to order and the force of old habit to put it only at that should dispose him not less effectively to believe in this young person at any price there she was all round imprisoned in the circle of the reasons it was impossible she should give certainly give him the house in the country was his house and thereby was charlotte s it was her own and amerigo s only so far as its proper master and mistress should profusely place it at their disposal maggie felt of course that she saw no limit to her father s profusion but this couldn t be even at the best the case with charlotte s whom it would never be decent when all was said to reduce to fighting for her preferences there were hours truly when the princess saw herself as not unarmed for battle if battle might only take place without spectators this last advantage for her was however too sadly out of the question her sole strength lay in her being able to see that if charlotte wouldn t want the assinghams it would be because that sentiment too would have motives and grounds she had all the while command of one way of meeting any objection any complaint on his wife s part reported to her by her father it would be open to her to retort to his possible what are your reasons my dear by a lucidly produced what are hers love please isn t that what we had better know mayn t her reasons be a dislike beautifully founded of the presence and thereby of the observation of persons who perhaps know about her things it s inconvenient to her they should know that hideous card she might in mere logic play being by this time at her still swifter private pace intimately familiar with all the fingered pasteboard in her pack but she could play it only on the forbidden issue of sacrificing him the issue so forbidden that it involved even a horror of finding out if he would really have consented to be sacrificed what she must do she must do by keeping her hands off him and nothing meanwhile as we see had less in common with that scruple than such a merciless manipulation of their yielding beneficiaries as her spirit so boldly revelled in she saw herself in this connexion without detachment saw others alone with intensity otherwise she might have been struck fairly have been amused by her free assignment of the pachydermatous quality if she could face the awkwardness of the persistence of her friends at fawns in spite of charlotte she somehow looked to them for an inspiration of courage that would improve upon her own they were in short not only themselves to find a plausibility and an audacity but were somehow by the way to pick up these forms for her maggie as well and she felt indeed that she was giving them scant time longer when one afternoon in portland place she broke out with an irrelevance that was merely superficial what awfulness in heaven s name is there between them what do you believe what do you know oh if she went by faces her visitor s sudden whiteness at this might have carried her far fanny assingham turned pale for it but there was something in such an appearance in the look it put into the eyes that renewed maggie s conviction of what this companion had been expecting she had been watching it come come from afar and now that it was there after all and the first convulsion over they would doubtless soon find themselves in a more real relation it was there because of the sunday luncheon they had partaken of alone together it was there as strangely as one would because of the bad weather the cold perverse june rain that was making the day wrong it was there because it stood for the whole sum of the perplexities and duplicities among which our young woman felt herself lately to have picked her steps it was there because amerigo and charlotte were again paying together alone a week end visit which it had been maggie s plan infernally to promote just to see if this time they really would it was there because she had kept fanny on her side from paying one she would manifestly have been glad to pay and had made her come instead stupidly vacantly boringly to luncheon all in the spirit of celebrating the fact that the prince and mrs verver had thus put it into her own power to describe them exactly as they were it had abruptly occurred in truth that maggie required the preliminary help of determining how they were though on the other hand before her guest had answered her question everything in the hour and the place everything in all the conditions affected her as crying it out her guest s stare of ignorance above all that of itself at first cried it out between them what do you mean anything there shouldn t be there shouldn t have been all this time do you believe there is or what s your idea fanny s idea was clearly to begin with that her young friend had taken her breath away but she looked at her very straight and very hard do you speak from a suspicion of your own i speak at last from a torment forgive me if it comes out i ve been thinking for months and months and i ve no one to turn to no one to help me to make things out no impression but my own don t you see to go by you ve been thinking for months and months mrs assingham took it in but what then dear maggie have you been thinking well horrible things like a little beast that i perhaps am that there may be something something wrong and dreadful something they cover up the elder woman s colour had begun to come back she was able though with a visible effort to face the question less amazedly you imagine poor child that the wretches are in love is that it but maggie for a minute only stared back at her help me to find out what i imagine i don t know i ve nothing but my perpetual anxiety have you any do you see what i mean if you ll tell me truly that at least one way or the other will do something for me fanny s look had taken a peculiar gravity a fulness with which it seemed to shine is what it comes to that you re jealous of charlotte do you mean whether i hate her and maggie thought no not on account of father ah mrs assingham returned that isn t what one would suppose what i ask is if you re jealous on account of your husband well said maggie presently perhaps that may be all if i m unhappy i m jealous it must come to the same thing and with you at least i m not afraid of the word if i m jealous don t you see i m tormented she went on and all the more if i m helpless and if i m both helpless and tormented i stuff my pocket handkerchief into my mouth i keep it there for the most part night and day so as not to be heard too indecently moaning only now with you at last i can t keep it longer i ve pulled it out and here i am fairly screaming at you they re away she wound up so they can t hear and i m by a miracle of arrangement not at luncheon with father at home i live in the midst of miracles of arrangement half of which i admit are my own i go about on tiptoe i watch for every sound i feel every breath and yet i try all the while to seem as smooth as old satin dyed rose colour have you ever thought of me she asked as really feeling as i do her companion conspicuously required to be clear jealous unhappy tormented no said mrs assingham but at the same time and though you may laugh at me for it i m bound to confess that i ve never been so awfully sure of what i may call knowing you here you are indeed as you say such a deep little person i ve never imagined your existence poisoned and since you wish to know if i consider that it need be i ve not the least difficulty in speaking on the spot nothing decidedly strikes me as more unnecessary for a minute after this they remained face to face maggie had sprung up while her friend sat enthroned and after moving to and fro in her intensity now paused to receive the light she had invoked it had accumulated considerably by this time round mrs assingham s ample presence and it made even to our young woman s own sense a medium in which she could at last take a deeper breath i ve affected you these months and these last weeks in especial as quiet and natural and easy but it was a question that took not imperceptibly some answering you ve never affected me from the first hour i beheld you as anything but in a way all your own absolutely good and sweet and beautiful in a way as i say mrs assingham almost caressingly repeated just all your very own nobody else s at all i ve never thought of you but as outside of ugly things so ignorant of any falsity or cruelty or vulgarity as never to have to be touched by them or to touch them i ve never mixed you up with them there would have been time enough for that if they had seemed to be near you but they haven t if that s what you want to know you ve only believed me contented then because you ve believed me stupid mrs assingham had a free smile now for the length of this stride dissimulated though it might be in a graceful little frisk if i had believed you stupid i shouldn t have thought you interesting and if i hadn t thought you interesting i shouldn t have noted whether i knew you as i ve called it or not what i ve always been conscious of is your having concealed about you somewhere no small amount of character quite as much in fact fanny smiled as one could suppose a person of your size able to carry the only thing was she explained that thanks to your never calling one s attention to it i hadn t made out much more about it and should have been vague above all as to where you carried it or kept it somewhere under i should simply have said like that little silver cross you once showed me blest by the holy father that you always wear out of sight next your skin that relic i ve had a glimpse of with which she continued to invoke the privilege of humour but the precious little innermost say this time little golden personal nature of you blest by a greater power i think even than the pope that you ve never consentingly shown me i m not sure you ve ever consentingly shown it to anyone you ve been in general too modest maggie trying to follow almost achieved a little fold of her forehead i strike you as modest to day modest when i stand here and scream at you oh your screaming i ve granted you is something new i must fit it on somewhere the question is however mrs assingham further proceeded of what the deuce i can fit it on to do you mean she asked to the fact of our friends being from yesterday to to morrow at a place where they may more or less irresponsibly meet she spoke with the air of putting it as badly for them as possible are you thinking of their being there alone of their having consented to be and then as she had waited without result for her companion to say but isn t it true that after you had this time again at the eleventh hour said you wouldn t they would really much rather not have gone yes they would certainly much rather not have gone but i wanted them to go then my dear child what in the world is the matter i wanted to see if they would and they ve had to maggie added it was the only thing her friend appeared to wonder from the moment you and your father backed out oh i don t mean go for those people i mean go for us for father and me maggie went on because now they know they know fanny assingham quavered that i ve been for some time past taking more notice notice of the queer things in our life maggie saw her companion for an instant on the point of asking her what these queer things might be but mrs assingham had the next minute brushed by that ambiguous opening and taken as she evidently felt a better one and is it for that you did it i mean gave up the visit it s for that i did it to leave them to themselves as they less and less want or at any rate less and less venture to appear to want to be left as they had for so long arranged things the princess went on you see they sometimes have to be and then as if baffled by the lucidity of this mrs assingham for a little said nothing now do you think i m modest with time however fanny could brilliantly think anything that would serve i think you re wrong that my dear is my answer to your question it demands assuredly the straightest i can make i see no awfulness i suspect none i m deeply distressed she added that you should do anything else it drew again from maggie a long look you ve never even imagined anything ah god forbid for it s exactly as a woman of imagination that i speak there s no moment of my life at which i m not imagining something and it s thanks to that darling mrs assingham pursued that i figure the sincerity with which your husband whom you see as viciously occupied with your stepmother is interested is tenderly interested in his admirable adorable wife she paused a minute as to give her friend the full benefit of this as to maggie s measure of which however no sign came and then poor woman haplessly she crowned her effort he wouldn t hurt a hair of your head it had produced in maggie at once and apparently in the intended form of a smile the most extraordinary expression ah there it is but her guest had already gone on and i m absolutely certain that charlotte wouldn t either it kept the princess with her strange grimace standing there no charlotte wouldn t either that s how they ve had again to go off together they ve been afraid not to lest it should disturb me aggravate me somehow work upon me as i insisted that they must that we couldn t all fail though father and charlotte hadn t really accepted as i did this they had to yield to the fear that their showing as afraid to move together would count for them as the greater danger which would be the danger you see of my feeling myself wronged their least danger they know is in going on with all the things that i ve seemed to accept and that i ve given no indication at any moment of not accepting everything that has come up for them has come up in an extraordinary manner without my having by a sound or a sign given myself away so that it s all as wonderful as you may conceive they move at any rate among the dangers i speak of between that of their doing too much and that of their not having any longer the confidence or the nerve or whatever you may call it to do enough her tone by this time might have shown a strangeness to match her smile which was still more marked as she wound up and that s how i make them do what i like it had an effect on mrs assingham who rose with the deliberation that from point to point marked the widening of her grasp my dear child you re amazing amazing you re terrible maggie thoughtfully shook her head no i m not terrible and you don t think me so i do strike you as surprising no doubt but surprisingly mild because don t you see i am mild i can bear anything oh bear mrs assingham fluted for love said the princess fanny hesitated of your father for love maggie repeated it kept her friend watching of your husband for love maggie said again it was for the moment as if the distinctness of this might have determined in her companion a choice between two or three highly different alternatives mrs assingham s rejoinder at all events however much or however little it was a choice was presently a triumph speaking with this love of your own then have you undertaken to convey to me that you believe your husband and your father s wife to be in act and in fact lovers of each other and then as the princess didn t at first answer do you call such an allegation as that mild oh i m not pretending to be mild to you but i ve told you and moreover you must have seen for yourself how much so i ve been to them mrs assingham more brightly again bridled is that what you call it when you make them for terror as you say do as you like ah there wouldn t be any terror for them if they had nothing to hide mrs assingham faced her quite steady now are you really conscious love of what you re saying i m saying that i m bewildered and tormented and that i ve no one but you to speak to i ve thought i ve in fact been sure that you ve seen for yourself how much this is the case it s why i ve believed you would meet me half way half way to what to denouncing fanny asked two persons friends of years whom i ve always immensely admired and liked and against whom i haven t the shadow of a charge to make maggie looked at her with wide eyes i had much rather you should denounce me than denounce them denounce me denounce me she said if you can see your way it was exactly what she appeared to have argued out with herself if conscientiously you can denounce me if conscientiously you can revile me if conscientiously you can put me in my place for a low minded little pig well said mrs assingham consideringly as she paused for emphasis i think i shall be saved her friend took it for a minute however by carrying thoughtful eyes eyes verily portentous over her head you say you ve no one to speak to and you make a point of your having so disguised your feelings not having as you call it given yourself away have you then never seen it not only as your right but as your bounden duty worked up to such a pitch to speak to your husband i ve spoken to him said maggie mrs assingham stared ah then it isn t true that you ve made no sign maggie had a silence i ve made no trouble i ve made no scene i ve taken no stand i ve neither reproached nor accused him you ll say there s a way in all that of being nasty enough oh dropped from fanny as if she couldn t help it but i don t think strangely enough that he regards me as nasty i think that at bottom for that is said the princess the strangeness he s sorry for me yes i think that deep within he pities me her companion wondered for the state you ve let yourself get into for not being happy when i ve so much to make me so you ve everything said mrs assingham with alacrity yet she remained for an instant embarrassed as to a further advance i don t understand however how if you ve done nothing an impatience from maggie had checked her i ve not done absolutely nothing but what then well she went on after a minute he knows what i ve done it produced on mrs assingham s part her whole tone and manner exquisitely aiding a hush not less prolonged and the very duration of which inevitably gave it something of the character of an equal recognition and what then has he done maggie took again a minute he has been splendid splendid then what more do you want ah what you see said maggie not to be afraid it made her guest again hang fire not to be afraid really to speak not to be afraid not to speak mrs assingham considered further you can t even to charlotte but as at this after a look at her maggie turned off with a movement of suppressed despair she checked herself and might have been watching her for all the difficulty and the pity of it vaguely moving to the window and the view of the hill street it was almost as if she had had to give up from failure of responsive wit in her friend the last failure she had feared the hope of the particular relief she had been working for mrs assingham resumed the next instant however in the very tone that seemed most to promise her she should have to give up nothing i see i see you would have in that case too many things to consider it brought the princess round again proving itself thus the note of comprehension she wished most to clutch at don t be afraid maggie took it where she stood which she was soon able to signify thank you it very properly encouraged her counsellor what your idea imputes is a criminal intrigue carried on from day to day amid perfect trust and sympathy not only under your eyes but under your father s that s an idea it s impossible for me for a moment to entertain ah there you are then it s exactly what i wanted from you you re welcome to it mrs assingham breathed you never have entertained it maggie pursued never for an instant said fanny with her head very high maggie took it again yet again as wanting more pardon my being so horrid but by all you hold sacred mrs assingham faced her ah my dear upon my positive word as an honest woman thank you then said the princess so they remained a little after which but do you believe it love fanny inquired i believe you well as i ve faith in them it comes to the same thing maggie at this last appeared for a moment to think again but she embraced the proposition the same thing then you re no longer unhappy her guest urged coming more gaily toward her i doubtless shan t be a great while but it was now mrs assingham s turn to want more i ve convinced you it s impossible she had held out her arms and maggie after a moment meeting her threw herself into them with a sound that had its oddity as a sign of relief impossible impossible she emphatically more than emphatically replied yet the next minute she had burst into tears over the impossibility and a few seconds later pressing clinging sobbing had even caused them to flow audibly sympathetically and perversely from her friend xxxi the understanding appeared to have come to be that the colonel and his wife were to present themselves toward the middle of july for the good long visit at fawns on which maggie had obtained from her father that he should genially insist as well as that the couple from eaton square should welcome there earlier in the month and less than a week after their own arrival the advent of the couple from portland place oh we shall give you time to breathe fanny remarked in reference to the general prospect with a gaiety that announced itself as heedless of criticism to each member of the party in turn sustaining and bracing herself by her emphasis pushed even to an amiable cynicism of the confident view of these punctualities of the assinghams the ground she could best occupy to her sense was that of her being moved as in this connexion she had always been moved by the admitted grossness of her avidity the way the hospitality of the ververs met her convenience and ministered to her ease destitute as the colonel had kept her from the first of any rustic retreat any leafy bower of her own any fixed base for the stale season now at hand she had explained at home she had repeatedly reexplained the terms of her dilemma the real difficulty of her or as she now put it of their position when the pair could do nothing else in cadogan place they could still talk of marvellous little maggie and of the charm the sinister charm of their having to hold their breath to watch her a topic the momentous midnight discussion at which we have been present was so far from having exhausted it came up irrepressibly at all private hours they had planted it there between them and it grew from day to day in a manner to make their sense of responsibility almost yield to their sense of fascination mrs assingham declared at such moments that in the interest of this admirable young thing to whom she also declared she had quite come over she was ready to pass with all the world else even with the prince himself the object inconsequently as well of her continued her explicitly shameless appreciation for a vulgar indelicate pestilential woman showing her true character in an abandoned old age the colonel s confessed attention had been enlisted we have seen as never yet under pressure from his wife by any guaranteed imbroglio but this she could assure him she perfectly knew was not a bit because he was sorry for her or touched by what she had let herself in for but because when once they had been opened he couldn t keep his eyes from resting complacently resting almost intelligently on the princess if he was in love with her now however so much the better it would help them both not to wince at what they would have to do for her mrs assingham had come back to that whenever he groaned or grunted she had at no beguiled moment since maggie s little march was positively beguiling let him lose sight of the grim necessity awaiting them we shall have as i ve again and again told you to lie for her to lie till we re black in the face to lie for her the colonel often at these hours as from a vague vision of old chivalry in a new form wandered into apparent lapses from lucidity to lie to her up and down and in and out it comes to the same thing it will consist just as much of lying to the others too to the prince about one s belief in him to charlotte about one s belief in her to mr verver dear sweet man about one s belief in everyone so we ve work cut out with the biggest lie on top of all being that we like to be there for such a purpose we hate it unspeakably i m more ready to be a coward before it to let the whole thing to let everyone selfishly and pusillanimously slide than before any social duty any felt human call that has ever forced me to be decent i speak at least for myself for you she had added as i ve given you so perfect an opportunity to fall in love with maggie you ll doubtless find your account in being so much nearer to her and what do you make the colonel could at this always imperturbably enough ask of the account you yourself will find in being so much nearer to the prince of your confirmed if not exasperated infatuation with whom to say nothing of my weak good nature about it you give such a pretty picture to the picture in question she had been always in fact able contemplatively to return the difficulty of my enjoyment of that is don t you see that i m making in my loyalty to maggie a sad hash of his affection for me you find means to call it then this whitewashing of his crime being loyal to maggie oh about that particular crime there is always much to say it is always more interesting to us than any other crime it has at least that for it but of course i call everything i have in mind at all being loyal to maggie being loyal to her is more than anything else helping her with her father which is what she most wants and needs the colonel had had it before but he could apparently never have too much of it helping her with him helping her against him then against what we ve already so fully talked of its having to be recognised between them that he doubts that s where my part is so plain to see her through to see her through to the end exaltation for the moment always lighted mrs assingham s reference to this plainness yet she at the same time seldom failed the next instant to qualify her view of it when i talk of my obligation as clear i mean that it s absolute for just how from day to day and through thick and thin to keep the thing up is i grant you another matter there s one way luckily nevertheless in which i m strong i can perfectly count on her the colonel seldom failed here as from the insidious growth of an excitement to wonder to encourage not to see you re lying to stick to me fast whatever she sees if i stick to her that is to my own poor struggling way under providence of watching over them all she ll stand by me to the death she won t give me away for you know she easily can this regularly was the most lurid turn of their road but bob assingham with each journey met it as for the first time easily she can utterly dishonour me with her father she can let him know that i was aware at the time of his marriage as i had been aware at the time of her own of the relations that had pre existed between his wife and her husband and how can she do so if up to this minute by your own statement she is herself in ignorance of your knowledge it was a question that mrs assingham had ever for dealing with a manner to which repeated practice had given almost a grand effect very much as if she was invited by it to say that about this exactly she proposed to do her best lying but she said and with full lucidity something quite other it could give itself a little the air still of a triumph over his coarseness by acting immediately with the blind resentment with which in her place ninety nine women out of a hundred would act and by so making mr verver in turn act with the same natural passion the passion of ninety nine men out of a hundred they ve only to agree about me the poor lady said they ve only to feel at one over it feel bitterly practised upon cheated and injured they ve only to denounce me to each other as false and infamous for me to be quite irretrievably dished of course it s i who have been and who continue to be cheated cheated by the prince and charlotte but they re not obliged to give me the benefit of that or to give either of us the benefit of anything they ll be within their rights to lump us all together as a false cruel conspiring crew and if they can find the right facts to support them get rid of us root and branch this on each occasion put the matter so at the worst that repetition even scarce controlled the hot flush with which she was compelled to see the parts of the whole history all its ugly consistency and its temporary gloss hang together she enjoyed invariably the sense of making her danger present of making it real to her husband and of his almost turning pale when their eyes met at this possibility of their compromised state and their shared discredit the beauty was that as under a touch of one of the ivory notes at the left of the keyboard he sounded out with the short sharpness of the dear fond stupid uneasy man conspiring so far as you were concerned to what end why to the obvious end of getting the prince a wife at maggie s expense and then to that of getting charlotte a husband at mr verver s of rendering friendly services yes which have produced as it turns out complications but from the moment you didn t do it for the complications why shouldn t you have rendered them it was extraordinary for her always in this connexion how with time given him he fell to speaking better for her than she could in the presence of her clear cut image of the worst speak for herself troubled as she was she thus never wholly failed of her amusement by the way oh isn t what i may have meddled for so far as it can be proved i did meddle open to interpretation by which i mean to mr verver s and maggie s mayn t they see my motive in the light of that appreciation as the wish to be decidedly more friendly to the others than to the victimised father and daughter she positively liked to keep it up mayn t they see my motive as the determination to serve the prince in any case and at any price first to place him comfortably in other words to find him his fill of money mayn t it have all the air for them of a really equivocal sinister bargain between us something quite unholy and louche it produced in the poor colonel infallibly the echo louche love why haven t you said as much yourself haven t you put your finger on that awful possibility she had a way now with his felicities that made him enjoy being reminded of them in speaking of your having always had such a mash such a mash precisely for the man i was to help to put so splendidly at his ease a motherly mash an impartial look at it would show it only as likely to have been but we re not talking of course about impartial looks we re talking of good innocent people deeply worked upon by a horrid discovery and going much further in their view of the lurid as such people almost always do than those who have been wider awake all round from the first what i was to have got from my friend in such a view in exchange for what i had been able to do for him well that would have been an equivalent of a kind best known to myself for me shrewdly to consider and she easily lost herself each time in the anxious satisfaction of filling out the picture it would have been seen it would have been heard of before the case of the woman a man doesn t want or of whom he s tired or for whom he has no use but such uses and who is capable in her infatuation in her passion of promoting his interests with other women rather than lose sight of him lose touch of him cease to have to do with him at all cela s est vu my dear and stranger things still as i needn t tell you very good then she wound up there is a perfectly possible conception of the behaviour of your sweet wife since as i say there s no imagination so lively once it s started as that of really agitated lambs lions are nothing to them for lions are sophisticated are blases are brought up from the first to prowling and mauling it does give us you ll admit something to think about my relief is luckily however in what i finally do think he was well enough aware by this time of what she finally did think but he was not without a sense again also for his amusement by the way it would have made him for a spectator of these passages between the pair resemble not a little the artless child who hears his favourite story told for the twentieth time and enjoys it exactly because he knows what is next to happen what of course will pull them up if they turn out to have less imagination than you assume is the profit you can have found in furthering mrs verver s marriage you weren t at least in love with charlotte oh mrs assingham at this always brought out my hand in that is easily accounted for by my desire to be agreeable to him to mr verver to the prince by preventing her in that way from taking as he was in danger of seeing her do some husband with whom he wouldn t be able to open to keep open so large an account as with his father in law i ve brought her near him kept her within his reach as she could never have remained either as a single woman or as the wife of a different man kept her on that sweet construction to be his mistress kept her on that sweet construction to be his mistress she brought it out grandly it had always so for her own ear as well as visibly for her husband s its effect the facilities in the case thanks to the particular conditions being so quite ideal down even to the facility of your minding everything so little from your own point of view as to have supplied him with the enjoyment of two beautiful women down even to that to the monstrosity of my folly but not mrs assingham added two of anything one beautiful woman and one beautiful fortune that s what a creature of pure virtue exposes herself to when she suffers her pure virtue suffers her sympathy her disinterestedness her exquisite sense for the lives of others to carry her too far voila i see it s the way the ververs have you it s the way the ververs have me it s in other words the way they would be able to make such a show to each other of having me if maggie weren t so divine she lets you off he never failed to insist on all this to the very end which was how he had become so versed in what she finally thought she lets me off so that now horrified and contrite at what i ve done i may work to help her out and mr verver she was fond of adding lets me off too then you do believe he knows it determined in her always there with a significant pause a deep immersion in her thought i believe he would let me off if he did know so that i might work to help him out or rather really she went on that i might work to help maggie that would be his motive that would be his condition in forgiving me just as hers for me in fact her motive and her condition are my acting to spare her father but it s with maggie only that i m directly concerned nothing ever not a breath not a look i ll guarantee shall i have whatever happens from mr verver himself so it is therefore that i shall probably by the closest possible shave escape the penalty of my crimes you mean being held responsible i mean being held responsible my advantage will be that maggie s such a trump such a trump that as you say she ll stick to you stick to me on our understanding stick to me for our understanding s signed and sealed and to brood over it again was ever for mrs assingham to break out again with exaltation it s a grand high compact she has solemnly promised but in words oh yes in words enough since it s a matter of words to keep up her lie so long as i keep up mine and what do you call her lie why the pretence that she believes me believes they re innocent she positively believes then they re guilty she has arrived at that she s really content with it in the absence of proof it was here each time that fanny assingham most faltered but always at last to get the matter for her own sense and with a long sigh sufficiently straight it isn t a question of belief or of proof absent or present it s inevitably with her a question of natural perception of insurmountable feeling she irresistibly knows that there s something between them but she hasn t arrived at it as you say at all that s exactly what she hasn t done what she so steadily and intensely refuses to do she stands off and off so as not to arrive she keeps out to sea and away from the rocks and what she most wants of me is to keep at a safe distance with her as i for my own skin only ask not to come nearer after which invariably she let him have it all so far from wanting proof which she must get in a manner by my siding with her she wants disproof as against herself and has appealed to me so extraordinarily to side against her it s really magnificent when you come to think of it the spirit of her appeal if i ll but cover them up brazenly enough the others so as to show round and about them as happy as a bird she on her side will do what she can if i ll keep them quiet in a word it will enable her to gain time time as against any idea of her father s and so somehow come out if i ll take care of charlotte in particular she ll take care of the prince and it s beautiful and wonderful really pathetic and exquisite to see what she feels that time may do for her ah but what does she call poor little thing time well this summer at fawns to begin with she can live as yet of course but from hand to mouth but she has worked it out for herself i think that the very danger of fawns superficially looked at may practically amount to a greater protection there the lovers if they are lovers will have to mind they ll feel it for themselves unless things are too utterly far gone with them and things are not too utterly far gone with them she had inevitably poor woman her hesitation for this but she put down her answer as for the purchase of some absolutely indispensable article she would have put down her last shilling no it made him always grin at her is that a lie do you think you re worth lying to if it weren t the truth for me she added i wouldn t have accepted for fawns i can i believe keep the wretches quiet but how at the worst oh the worst don t talk about the worst i can keep them quiet at the best i seem to feel simply by our being there it will work from week to week of itself you ll see he was willing enough to see but he desired to provide yet if it doesn t work ah that s talking about the worst well it might be but what were they doing from morning to night at this crisis but talk who ll keep the others the others who ll keep them quiet if your couple have had a life together they can t have had it completely without witnesses without the help of persons however few who must have some knowledge some idea about them they ve had to meet secretly protectedly they ve had to arrange for if they haven t met and haven t arranged and haven t thereby in some quarter or other had to give themselves away why are we piling it up so therefore if there s evidence up and down london there must be people in possession of it ah it isn t all she always remembered up and down london some of it must connect them i mean she musingly added it naturally would with other places with who knows what strange adventures opportunities dissimulations but whatever there may have been it will also all have been buried on the spot oh they ve known how too beautifully but nothing all the same is likely to find its way to maggie of itself because every one who may have anything to tell you hold will have been so squared and then inveterately before she could say he enjoyed so much coming to this what will have squared lady castledean the consciousness she had never lost her promptness of having no stones to throw at any one else s windows she has enough to do to guard her own glass that was what she was doing fanny said that last morning at matcham when all of us went off and she kept the prince and charlotte over she helped them simply that she might herself be helped if it wasn t perhaps rather with her ridiculous mr blint that he might be they put in together therefore of course that day they got it clear and quite under her eyes inasmuch as they didn t become traceable again as we know till late in the evening on this historic circumstance mrs assingham was always ready afresh to brood but she was no less ready after her brooding devoutly to add only we know nothing whatever else for which all our stars be thanked the colonel s gratitude was apt to be less marked what did they do for themselves all the same from the moment they got that free hand to the moment long after dinner time haven t you told me of their turning up at their respective homes well it s none of your business i don t speak of it as mine but it s only too much theirs people are always traceable in england when tracings are required something sooner or later happens somebody sooner or later breaks the holy calm murder will out murder will but this isn t murder quite the contrary perhaps i verily believe she had her moments of adding that for the amusement of the row you would prefer an explosion this however was a remark he seldom noticed he wound up for the most part after a long contemplative smoke with a transition from which no exposed futility in it had succeeded in weaning him what i can t for my life make out is your idea of the old boy charlotte s too inconceivably funny husband i have no idea i beg your pardon you ve just shown it you never speak of him but as too inconceivably funny well he is she always confessed that is he may be for all i know too inconceivably great but that s not an idea it represents only my weak necessity of feeling that he s beyond me which isn t an idea either you see he may be stupid too precisely there you are yet on the other hand she always went on he may be sublime sublimer even than maggie herself he may in fact have already been but we shall never know with which her tone betrayed perhaps a shade of soreness for the single exemption she didn t yearningly welcome that i can see oh i say it came to affect the colonel himself with a sense of privation i m not sure even that charlotte will oh my dear what charlotte doesn t know but she brooded and brooded i m not sure even that the prince will it seemed privation in short for them all they ll be mystified confounded tormented but they won t know and all their possible putting their heads together won t make them that said fanny assingham will be their punishment and she ended ever when she had come so far at the same pitch it will probably also if i get off with so little be mine and what her husband liked to ask will be mine nothing you re not worthy of any one s punishment is in what one feels and what will make ours effective is that we shall feel she was splendid with her ours she flared up with this prophecy it will be maggie herself who will mete it out maggie she ll know about her father everything everything she repeated on the vision of which each time mrs assingham as with the presentiment of an odd despair turned away from it but she ll never tell us xxxii if maggie had not so firmly made up her mind never to say either to her good friend or to any one else more than she meant about her father she might have found herself betrayed into some such overflow during the week spent in london with her husband after the others had adjourned to fawns for the summer this was because of the odd element of the unnatural imparted to the so simple fact of their brief separation by the assumptions resident in their course of life hitherto she was used herself certainly by this time to dealing with odd elements but she dropped instantly even from such peace as she had patched up when it was a question of feeling that her unpenetrated parent might be alone with them she thought of him as alone with them when she thought of him as alone with charlotte and this strangely enough even while fixing her sense to the full on his wife s power of preserving quite of enhancing every felicitous appearance charlotte had done that under immeasurably fewer difficulties indeed during the numerous months of their hymeneal absence from england the period prior to that wonderful reunion of the couples in the interest of the larger play of all the virtues of each which was now bearing for mrs verver s stepdaughter at least such remarkable fruit it was the present so much briefer interval in a situation possibly in a relation so changed it was the new terms of her problem that would tax charlotte s art the princess could pull herself up repeatedly by remembering that the real relation between her father and his wife was a thing that she knew nothing about and that in strictness was none of her business but she none the less failed to keep quiet as she would have called it before the projected image of their ostensibly happy isolation nothing could have had less of the quality of quietude than a certain queer wish that fitfully flickered up in her a wish that usurped perversely the place of a much more natural one if charlotte while she was about it could only have been worse that idea maggie fell to invoking instead of the idea that she might desirably have been better for exceedingly odd as it was to feel in such ways she believed she mightn t have worried so much if she didn t somehow make her stepmother out under the beautiful trees and among the dear old gardens as lavish of fifty kinds of confidence and twenty kinds at least of gentleness gentleness and confidence were certainly the right thing as from a charming woman to her husband but the fine tissue of reassurance woven by this lady s hands and flung over her companion as a light muffling veil formed precisely a wrought transparency through which she felt her father s eyes continually rest on herself the reach of his gaze came to her straighter from a distance it showed him as still more conscious down there alone of the suspected the felt elaboration of the process of their not alarming or hurting him she had herself now for weeks and weeks and all unwinkingly traced the extension of this pious effort but her perfect success in giving no sign she did herself that credit would have been an achievement quite wasted if mrs verver should make with him those mistakes of proportion one set of them too abruptly too incoherently designed to correct another set that she had made with his daughter however if she had been worse poor woman who should say that her husband would to a certainty have been better one groped noiselessly among such questions and it was actually not even definite for the princess that her own amerigo left alone with her in town had arrived at the golden mean of non precautionary gallantry which would tend by his calculation to brush private criticism from its last perching place the truth was in this connection that she had different sorts of terrors and there were hours when it came to her that these days were a prolonged repetition of that night drive of weeks before from the other house to their own when he had tried to charm her by his sovereign personal power into some collapse that would commit her to a repudiation of consistency she was never alone with him it was to be said without her having sooner or later to ask herself what had already become of her consistency yet at the same time so long as she breathed no charge she kept hold of a remnant of appearance that could save her from attack attack real attack from him as he would conduct it was what she above all dreaded she was so far from sure that under that experience she mightn t drop into some depth of weakness mightn t show him some shortest way with her that he would know how to use again therefore since she had given him as yet no moment s pretext for pretending to her that she had either lost faith or suffered by a feather s weight in happiness she left him it was easy to reason with an immense advantage for all waiting and all tension she wished him for the present to make up to her for nothing who could say to what making up might lead into what consenting or pretending or destroying blindness it might plunge her she loved him too helplessly still to dare to open the door by an inch to his treating her as if either of them had wronged the other something or somebody and who at this which of them all would inevitably would in the gust of momentary selfishness be sacrificed to that whereas what she intelligently needed was to know where she was going knowledge knowledge was a fascination as well as a fear and a part precisely of the strangeness of this juncture was the way her apprehension that he would break out to her with some merely general profession was mixed with her dire need to forgive him to reassure him to respond to him on no ground that she didn t fully measure to do these things it must be clear to her what they were for but to act in that light was by the same effect to learn horribly what the other things had been he might tell her only what he wanted only what would work upon her by the beauty of his appeal and the result of the direct appeal of any beauty in him would be her helpless submission to his terms all her temporary safety her hand to mouth success accordingly was in his neither perceiving nor divining this thanks to such means as she could take to prevent him take literally from hour to hour during these days of more unbroken exposure from hour to hour she fairly expected some sign of his having decided on a jump ah yes it has been as you think i ve strayed away i ve fancied myself free given myself in other quantities with larger generosities because i thought you were different different from what i now see but it was only only because i didn t know and you must admit that you gave me scarce reason enough reason enough i mean to keep clear of my mistake to which i confess for which i ll do exquisite penance which you can help me now i too beautifully feel to get completely over that was what while she watched herself she potentially heard him bring out and while she carried to an end another day another sequence and yet another of their hours together without his producing it she felt herself occupied with him beyond even the intensity of surrender she was keeping her head for a reason for a cause and the labour of this detachment with the labour of her keeping the pitch of it down held them together in the steel hoop of an intimacy compared with which artless passion would have been but a beating of the air her greatest danger or at least her greatest motive for care was the obsession of the thought that if he actually did suspect the fruit of his attention to her couldn t help being a sense of the growth of her importance taking the measure with him as she had taken it with her father of the prescribed reach of her hypocrisy she saw how it would have to stretch even to her seeking to prove that she was not all the same important a single touch from him oh she should know it in case of its coming any brush of his hand of his lips of his voice inspired by recognition of her probable interest as distinct from pity for her virtual gloom would hand her over to him bound hand and foot therefore to be free to be free to act other than abjectly for her father she must conceal from him the validity that like a microscopic insect pushing a grain of sand she was taking on even for herself she could keep it up with a change in sight but she couldn t keep it up forever so that really one extraordinary effect of their week of untempered confrontation which bristled with new marks was to make her reach out in thought to their customary companions and calculate the kind of relief that rejoining them would bring she was learning almost from minute to minute to be a mistress of shades since always when there were possibilities enough of intimacy there were also by that fact in intercourse possibilities of iridescence but she was working against an adversary who was a master of shades too and on whom if she didn t look out she should presently have imposed a consciousness of the nature of their struggle to feel him in fact to think of his feeling himself her adversary in things of this fineness to see him at all in short brave a name that would represent him as in opposition was already to be nearly reduced to a visible smothering of her cry of alarm should he guess they were having in their so occult manner a high fight and that it was she all the while in her supposed stupidity who had made it high and was keeping it high in the event of his doing this before they could leave town she should verily be lost the possible respite for her at fawns would come from the fact that observation in him there would inevitably find some of its directness diverted this would be the case if only because the remarkable strain of her father s placidity might be thought of as likely to claim some larger part of his attention besides which there would be always charlotte herself to draw him off charlotte would help him again doubtless to study anything right or left that might be symptomatic but maggie could see that this very fact might perhaps contribute in its degree to protect the secret of her own fermentation it is not even incredible that she may have discovered the gleam of a comfort that was to broaden in the conceivable effect on the prince s spirit on his nerves on his finer irritability of some of the very airs and aspects the light graces themselves of mrs verver s too perfect competence what it would most come to after all she said to herself was a renewal for him of the privilege of watching that lady watch her very well then with the elements after all so mixed in him how long would he go on enjoying mere spectatorship of that act for she had by this time made up her mind that in charlotte s company he deferred to charlotte s easier art of mounting guard wouldn t he get tired to put it only at that of seeing her always on the rampart erect and elegant with her lace flounced parasol now folded and now shouldered march to and fro against a gold coloured east or west maggie had gone far truly for a view of the question of this particular reaction and she was not incapable of pulling herself up with the rebuke that she counted her chickens before they were hatched how sure she should have to be of so many things before she might thus find a weariness in amerigo s expression and a logic in his weariness one of her dissimulated arts for meeting their tension meanwhile was to interweave mrs assingham as plausibly as possible with the undulations of their surface to bring it about that she should join them of an afternoon when they drove together or if they went to look at things looking at things being almost as much a feature of their life as if they were bazaar opening royalties then there were such combinations later in the day as her attendance on them and the colonel s as well for such whimsical matters as visits to the opera no matter who was singing and sudden outbreaks of curiosity about the british drama the good couple from cadogan place could always unprotestingly dine with them and go on afterwards to such publicities as the princess cultivated the boldness of now perversely preferring it may be said of her that during these passages she plucked her sensations by the way detached nervously the small wild blossoms of her dim forest so that she could smile over them at least with the spacious appearance for her companions for her husband above all of bravely of altogether frivolously going a maying she had her intense her smothered excitements some of which were almost inspirations she had in particular the extravagant positively at moments the amused sense of using her friend to the topmost notch accompanied with the high luxury of not having to explain never no never should she have to explain to fanny assingham again who poor woman on her own side would be charged it might be forever with that privilege of the higher ingenuity she put it all off on fanny and the dear thing herself might henceforth appraise the quantity more and more magnificent now in her blameless egoism maggie asked no questions of her and thus only signified the greatness of the opportunity she gave her she didn t care for what devotions what dinners of their own the assinghams might have been booked that was a detail and she could think without wincing of the ruptures and rearrangements to which her service condemned them it all fell in beautifully moreover so that as hard at this time in spite of her fever as a little pointed diamond the princess showed something of the glitter of consciously possessing the constructive the creative hand she had but to have the fancy of presenting herself of presenting her husband in a certain high and convenient manner to make it natural they should go about with their gentleman and their lady to what else but this exactly had charlotte during so many weeks of the earlier season worked her up herself assuming and discharging so far as might be the character and office of one of those revolving subordinate presences that float in the wake of greatness the precedent was therefore established and the group normally constituted mrs assingham meanwhile at table on the stairs in the carriage or the opera box might with her constant overflow of expression for that matter and its singularly resident character where men in especial were concerned look across at amerigo in whatever sense she liked it was not of that maggie proposed to be afraid she might warn him she might rebuke him she might reassure him she might if it were impossible not to absolutely make love to him even this was open to her as a matter simply between them if it would help her to answer for the impeccability he had guaranteed and maggie desired in fact only to strike her as acknowledging the efficacy of her aid when she mentioned to her one evening a small project for the morrow privately entertained the idea irresistible intense of going to pay at the museum a visit to mr crichton mr crichton as mrs assingham could easily remember was the most accomplished and obliging of public functionaries whom every one knew and who knew every one who had from the first in particular lent himself freely and for the love of art and history to becoming one of the steadier lights of mr verver s adventurous path the custodian of one of the richest departments of the great national collection of precious things he could feel for the sincere private collector and urge him on his way even when condemned to be present at his capture of trophies sacrificed by the country to parliamentary thrift he carried his amiability to the point of saying that since london under pettifogging views had to miss from time to time its rarest opportunities he was almost consoled to see such lost causes invariably wander at last one by one with the tormenting tinkle of their silver bells into the wondrous the already famous fold beyond the mississippi there was a charm in his almosts that was not to be resisted especially after mr verver and maggie had grown sure or almost again of enjoying the monopoly of them and on this basis of envy changed to sympathy by the more familiar view of the father and the daughter mr crichton had at both houses though especially in eaton square learned to fill out the responsive and suggestive character it was at his invitation fanny well recalled that maggie one day long before and under her own attendance precisely had for the glory of the name she bore paid a visit to one of the ampler shrines of the supreme exhibitory temple an alcove of shelves charged with the gold and brown gold and ivory of old italian bindings and consecrated to the records of the prince s race it had been an impression that penetrated that remained yet maggie had sighed ever so prettily at its having to be so superficial she was to go back some day to dive deeper to linger and taste in spite of which however mrs assingham could not recollect perceiving that the visit had been repeated this second occasion had given way for a long time in her happy life to other occasions all testifying in their degree to the quality of her husband s blood its rich mixture and its many remarkable references after which no doubt the charming piety involved had grown on still further grounds bewildered and faint it now appeared none the less that some renewed conversation with mr crichton had breathed on the faintness revivingly and maggie mentioned her purpose as a conception of her very own to the success of which she designed to devote her morning visits of gracious ladies under his protection lighted up rosily for this perhaps most flower loving and honey sipping member of the great bloomsbury hive its packed passages and cells and though not sworn of the province toward which his friend had found herself according to her appeal to him yearning again nothing was easier for him than to put her in relation with the presiding urbanities so it had been settled maggie said to mrs assingham and she was to dispense with amerigo s company fanny was to remember later on that she had at first taken this last fact for one of the finer notes of her young woman s detachment imagined she must be going alone because of the shade of irony that in these ambiguous days her husband s personal presence might be felt to confer practically on any tribute to his transmitted significance then as the next moment she felt it clear that so much plotted freedom was virtually a refinement of reflection an impulse to commemorate afresh whatever might still survive of pride and hope her sense of ambiguity happily fell and she congratulated her companion on having anything so exquisite to do and on being so exquisitely in the humour to do it after the occasion had come and gone she was confirmed in her optimism she made out in the evening that the hour spent among the projected lights the annals and illustrations the parchments and portraits the emblazoned volumes and the murmured commentary had been for the princess enlarging and inspiring maggie had said to her some days before very sweetly but very firmly invite us to dine please for friday and have any one you like or you can it doesn t in the least matter whom and the pair in cadogan place had bent to this mandate with a docility not in the least ruffled by all that it took for granted it provided for an evening this had been maggie s view and she lived up to her view in her friend s eyes by treating the occasion more or less explicitly as new and strange the good assinghams had feasted in fact at the two other boards on a scale so disproportionate to the scant solicitations of their own that it was easy to make a joke of seeing how they fed at home how they met themselves the question of giving to eat maggie dined with them in short and arrived at making her husband appear to dine much in the manner of a pair of young sovereigns who have in the frolic humour of the golden years of reigns proposed themselves to a pair of faithfully serving subjects she showed an interest in their arrangements an inquiring tenderness almost for their economies so that her hostess not unnaturally as they might have said put it all down the tone and the freedom of which she set the example to the effect wrought in her afresh by one of the lessons learned in the morning at the altar of the past hadn t she picked it up from an anecdote or two offered again to her attention that there were for princesses of such a line more ways than one of being a heroine maggie s way to night was to surprise them all truly by the extravagance of her affability she was doubtless not positively boisterous yet though mrs assingham as a bland critic had never doubted her being graceful she had never seen her put so much of it into being what might have been called assertive it was all a tune to which fanny s heart could privately palpitate her guest was happy happy as a consequence of something that had occurred but she was making the prince not lose a ripple of her laugh though not perhaps always enabling him to find it absolutely not foolish foolish in public beyond a certain point he was scarce the man to brook his wife s being thought to be so that there hovered before their friend the possibility of some subsequent scene between them in the carriage or at home of slightly sarcastic inquiry of promptly invited explanation a scene that according as maggie should play her part in it might or might not precipitate developments what made these appearances practically thrilling meanwhile was this mystery a mystery it was clear to amerigo himself of the incident or the influence that had so peculiarly determined them the lady of cadogan place was to read deeper however within three days and the page was turned for her on the eve of her young confidant s leaving london the awaited migration to fawns was to take place on the morrow and it was known meanwhile to mrs assingham that their party of four were to dine that night at the american embassy with another and a larger party so that the elder woman had a sense of surprise on receiving from the younger under date of six o clock a telegram requesting her immediate attendance please come to me at once dress early if necessary so that we shall have time the carriage ordered for us will take you back first mrs assingham on quick deliberation dressed though not perhaps with full lucidity and by seven o clock was in portland place where her friend upstairs and described to her on her arrival as herself engaged in dressing instantly received her she knew on the spot poor fanny as she was afterwards to declare to the colonel that her feared crisis had popped up as at the touch of a spring that her impossible hour was before her her impossible hour was the hour of its coming out that she had known of old so much more than she had ever said and she had often put it to herself in apprehension she tried to think even in preparation that she should recognise the approach of her doom by a consciousness akin to that of the blowing open of a window on some night of the highest wind and the lowest thermometer it would be all in vain to have crouched so long by the fire the glass would have been smashed the icy air would fill the place if the air in maggie s room then on her going up was not as yet quite the polar blast she had expected it was distinctly none the less such an atmosphere as they had not hitherto breathed together the princess she perceived was completely dressed that business was over it added indeed to the effect of her importantly awaiting the assistance she had summoned of her showing a deck cleared so to speak for action her maid had already left her and she presented herself in the large clear room where everything was admirable but where nothing was out of place as for the first time in her life rather bedizened was it that she had put on too many things overcharged herself with jewels wore in particular more of them than usual and bigger ones in her hair a question her visitor presently answered by attributing this appearance largely to the bright red spot red as some monstrous ruby that burned in either of her cheeks these two items of her aspect had promptly enough their own light for mrs assingham who made out by it that nothing more pathetic could be imagined than the refuge and disguise her agitation had instinctively asked of the arts of dress multiplied to extravagance almost to incoherence she had had visibly her idea that of not betraying herself by inattentions into which she had never yet fallen and she stood there circled about and furnished forth as always in a manner that testified to her perfect little personal processes it had ever been her sign that she was for all occasions found ready without loose ends or exposed accessories or unremoved superfluities a suggestion of the swept and garnished in her whole splendid yet thereby more or less encumbered and embroidered setting that reflected her small still passion for order and symmetry for objects with their backs to the walls and spoke even of some probable reference in her american blood to dusting and polishing new england grandmothers if her apartment was princely in the clearness of the lingering day she looked as if she had been carried there prepared all attired and decorated like some holy image in a procession and left precisely to show what wonder she could work under pressure her friend felt how could she not as the truly pious priest might feel when confronted behind the altar before the festa with his miraculous madonna such an occasion would be grave in general with all the gravity of what he might look for but the gravity to night would be of the rarest what he might look for would depend so on what he could give xxxiii something very strange has happened and i think you ought to know it maggie spoke this indeed without extravagance yet with the effect of making her guest measure anew the force of her appeal it was their definite understanding whatever fanny knew fanny s faith would provide for and she knew accordingly at the end of five minutes what the extraordinary in the late occurrence had consisted of and how it had all come of maggie s achieved hour under mr crichton s protection at the museum he had desired mr crichton with characteristic kindness after the wonderful show after offered luncheon at his incorporated lodge hard by to see her safely home especially on his noting in attending her to the great steps that she had dismissed her carriage which she had done really just for the harmless amusement of taking her way alone she had known she should find herself as the consequence of such an hour in a sort of exalted state under the influence of which a walk through the london streets would be exactly what would suit her best an independent ramble impressed excited contented with nothing to mind and nobody to talk to and shop windows in plenty to look at if she liked a low taste of the essence it was to be supposed of her nature that she had of late for so many reasons been unable to gratify she had taken her leave with her thanks she knew her way quite enough it being also sufficiently the case that she had even a shy hope of not going too straight to wander a little wild was what would truly amuse her so that keeping clear of oxford street and cultivating an impression as of parts she didn t know she had ended with what she had more or less had been fancying an encounter with three or four shops an old bookseller s an old printmonger s a couple of places with dim antiquities in the window that were not as so many of the other shops those in sloane street say a hollow parade which had long since ceased to beguile there had remained with her moreover an allusion of charlotte s of some months before seed dropped into her imagination in the form of a casual speech about there being in bloomsbury such funny little fascinating places and even sometimes such unexpected finds there could perhaps have been no stronger mark than this sense of well nigh romantic opportunity no livelier sign of the impression made on her and always so long retained so watchfully nursed by any observation of charlotte s however lightly thrown off and then she had felt somehow more at her ease than for months and months before she didn t know why but her time at the museum oddly had done it it was as if she hadn t come into so many noble and beautiful associations nor secured them also for her boy secured them even for her father only to see them turn to vanity and doubt turn possibly to something still worse i believed in him again as much as ever and i felt how i believed in him she said with bright fixed eyes i felt it in the streets as i walked along and it was as if that helped me and lifted me up my being off by myself there not having for the moment to wonder and watch having on the contrary almost nothing on my mind it was so much as if everything would come out right that she had fallen to thinking of her father s birthday had given herself this as a reason for trying what she could pick up for it they would keep it at fawns where they had kept it before since it would be the twenty first of the month and she mightn t have another chance of making sure of something to offer him there was always the impossibility of course of finding him anything the least bit good that he wouldn t already long ago in his rummagings have seen himself and only not to think a quarter good enough this however was an old story and one could not have had any fun with him but for his sweet theory that the individual gift the friendship s offering was by a rigorous law of nature a foredoomed aberration and that the more it was so the more it showed and the more one cherished it for showing how friendly it had been the infirmity of art was the candour of affection the grossness of pedigree the refinement of sympathy the ugliest objects in fact as a general thing were the bravest the tenderest mementos and as such figured in glass cases apart worthy doubtless of the home but not worthy of the temple dedicated to the grimacing not to the clear faced gods she herself naturally through the past years had come to be much represented in those receptacles against the thick locked panes of which she still liked to flatten her nose finding in its place each time everything she had on successive anniversaries tried to believe he might pretend at her suggestion to be put off with or at least think curious she was now ready to try it again they had always with his pleasure in her pretence and her pleasure in his with the funny betrayal of the sacrifice to domestic manners on either side played the game so happily to this end on her way home she had loitered everywhere quite too deludedly among the old books and the old prints which had yielded nothing to her purpose but with a strange inconsequence in one of the other shops that of a small antiquarian a queer little foreign man who had shown her a number of things shown her finally something that struck with it as rather a rarity and thinking it would compared to some of her ventures quite superlatively do she had bought bought really when it came to that for a price it appears now it won t do at all said maggie something has happened since that puts it quite out of the question i had only my day of satisfaction in it but i feel at the same time as i keep it here before me that i wouldn t have missed it for the world she had talked from the first of her friend s entrances coherently enough even with a small quaver that overstated her calm but she held her breath every few seconds as if for deliberation and to prove she didn t pant all of which marked for fanny the depth of her commotion her reference to her thought about her father about her chance to pick up something that might divert him her mention in fine of his fortitude under presents having meanwhile naturally it should be said much less an amplitude of insistence on the speaker s lips than a power to produce on the part of the listener herself the prompt response and full comprehension of memory and sympathy of old amused observation the picture was filled out by the latter s fond fancy but maggie was at any rate under arms she knew what she was doing and had already her plan a plan for making for allowing as yet no difference in accordance with which she would still dine out and not with red eyes nor convulsed features nor neglected items of appearance nor anything that would raise a question yet there was some knowledge that exactly to this support of her not breaking down she desired she required possession of and with the sinister rise and fall of lightning unaccompanied by thunder it played before mrs assingham s eyes that she herself should have at whatever risk or whatever cost to supply her with the stuff of her need all our friend s instinct was to hold off from this till she should see what the ground would bear she would take no step nearer unless intelligibly to meet her and awkward though it might be to hover there only pale and distorted with mere imbecilities of vagueness there was a quality of bald help in the fact of not as yet guessing what such an ominous start could lead to she caught however after a second s thought at the princess s allusion to her lost reassurance you mean you were so at your ease on monday the night you dined with us i was very happy then said maggie yes we thought you so gay and so brilliant fanny felt it feeble but she went on we were so glad you were happy maggie stood a moment at first only looking at her you thought me all right eh surely dearest we thought you all right well i daresay it was natural but in point of fact i never was more wrong in my life for all the while if you please this was brewing mrs assingham indulged as nearly as possible to luxury her vagueness this that replied the princess whose eyes her companion now saw had turned to an object on the chimney piece of the room of which among so many precious objects the ververs wherever they might be always revelled peculiarly in matchless old mantel ornaments her visitor had not taken heed do you mean the gilt cup i mean the gilt cup the piece now recognised by fanny as new to her own vision was a capacious bowl of old looking rather strikingly yellow gold mounted by a short stem on an ample foot which held a central position above the fire place where to allow it the better to show a clearance had been made of other objects notably of the louis seize clock that accompanied the candelabra this latter trophy ticked at present on the marble slab of a commode that exactly matched it in splendour and style mrs assingham took it the bowl as a fine thing but the question was obviously not of its intrinsic value and she kept off from it admiring it at a distance but what has that to do it has everything you ll see with which again however for the moment maggie attached to her strange wide eyes he knew her before before i had ever seen him he knew but fanny while she cast about her for the links she missed could only echo it amerigo knew charlotte more than i ever dreamed fanny felt then it was stare for stare but surely you always knew they had met i didn t understand i knew too little don t you see what i mean the princess asked mrs assingham wondered during these instants how much she even now knew it had taken a minute to perceive how gently she was speaking with that perception of its being no challenge of wrath no heat of the deceived soul but only a free exposure of the completeness of past ignorance inviting derision even if it must the elder woman felt first a strange barely credible relief she drew in as if it had been the warm summer scent of a flower the sweet certainty of not meeting any way she should turn any consequence of judgment she shouldn t be judged save by herself which was her own wretched business the next moment however at all events she blushed within for her immediate cowardice she had thought of herself thought of getting off before so much as thinking that is of pitifully seeing that she was in presence of an appeal that was all an appeal that utterly accepted its necessity in a general way dear child yes but not a in connexion with what you ve been telling me they were intimate you see intimate said the princess fanny continued to face her taking from her excited eyes this history so dim and faint for all her anxious emphasis of the far away other time there s always the question of what one considers what one considers intimate well i know what i consider intimate now too intimate said maggie to let me know anything about it it was quiet yes but not too quiet for fanny assingham s capacity to wince only compatible with letting me you mean she had asked it after a pause but turning again to the new ornament of the chimney and wondering even while she took relief from it at this gap in her experience but here are things my dear of which my ignorance is perfect they went about together they re known to have done it and i don t mean only before i mean after after said fanny assingham before we were married yes but after we were engaged ah i ve known nothing about that and she said it with a braver assurance clutching with comfort at something that was apparently new to her that bowl maggie went on is so strangely too strangely almost to believe at this time of day the proof they were together all the while up to the very eve of our marriage don t you remember how just before that she came back so unexpectedly from america the question had for mrs assingham and whether all consciously or not the oddest pathos of simplicity oh yes dear of course i remember how she came back from america and how she stayed with us and what view one had of it maggie s eyes still all the time pressed and penetrated so that during a moment just here she might have given the little flare have made the little pounce of asking what then one s view had been to the small flash of this eruption fanny stood for her minute wittingly exposed but she saw it as quickly cease to threaten quite saw the princess even though in all her pain refuse in the interest of their strange and exalted bargain to take advantage of the opportunity for planting the stab of reproach the opportunity thus coming all of itself she saw her or she believed she saw her look at her chance for straight denunciation look at it and then pass it by and she felt herself with this fact hushed well nigh to awe at the lucid higher intention that no distress could confound and that no discovery since it was however obscurely a case of discovery could make less needful these seconds were brief they rapidly passed but they lasted long enough to renew our friend s sense of her own extraordinary undertaking the function again imposed on her the answerability again drilled into her by this intensity of intimation she was reminded of the terms on which she was let off her quantity of release having made its sufficient show in that recall of her relation to charlotte s old reappearance and deep within the whole impression glowed ah so inspiringly when it came to that her steady view clear from the first of the beauty of her companion s motive it was like a fresh sacrifice for a larger conquest only see me through now do it in the face of this and in spite of it and i leave you a hand of which the freedom isn t to be said the aggravation of fear or call it apparently of knowledge had jumped straight into its place as an aggravation above all for her father the effect of this being but to quicken to passion her reasons for making his protectedness or in other words the forms of his ignorance still the law of her attitude and the key to her solution she kept as tight hold of these reasons and these forms in her confirmed horror as the rider of a plunging horse grasps his seat with his knees and she might absolutely have been putting it to her guest that she believed she could stay on if they should only meet nothing more though ignorant still of what she had definitely met fanny yearned within over her spirit and so no word about it said passed through mere pitying eyes a vow to walk ahead and at crossroads with a lantern for the darkness and wavings away for unadvised traffic look out for alarms there was accordingly no wait in maggie s reply they spent together hours spent at least a morning the certainty of which has come back to me now but that i didn t dream of it at the time that cup there has turned witness by the most wonderful of chances that s why since it has been here i ve stood it out for my husband to see put it where it would meet him almost immediately if he should come into the room i ve wanted it to meet him she went on and i ve wanted him to meet it and to be myself present at the meeting but that hasn t taken place as yet often as he has lately been in the way of coming to see me here yes in particular lately he hasn t showed to day it was with her managed quietness more and more that she talked an achieved coherence that helped her evidently to hear and to watch herself there was support and thereby an awful harmony but which meant a further guidance in the facts she could add together it s quite as if he had an instinct something that has warned him off or made him uneasy he doesn t quite know naturally what has happened but guesses with his beautiful cleverness that something has and isn t in a hurry to be confronted with it so in his vague fear he keeps off but being meanwhile in the house i ve no idea not having seen him to day by exception since before luncheon he spoke to me then the princess freely explained of a ballot of great importance at a club for somebody some personal friend i think who s coming up and is supposed to be in danger to make an effort for him he thought he had better lunch there you see the efforts he can make for which maggie found a smile that went to her friend s heart he s in so many ways the kindest of men but it was hours ago mrs assingham thought the more danger then of his coming in and finding me here i don t know you see what you now consider that you ve ascertained nor anything of the connexion with it of that object that you declare so damning her eyes rested on this odd acquisition and then quitted it went back to it and again turned from it it was inscrutable in its rather stupid elegance and yet from the moment one had thus appraised it vivid and definite in its domination of the scene fanny could no more overlook it now than she could have overlooked a lighted christmas tree but nervously and all in vain she dipped into her mind for some floating reminiscence of it at the same time that this attempt left her blank she understood a good deal she even not a little shared the prince s mystic apprehension the golden bowl put on under consideration a sturdy a conscious perversity as a document somehow it was ugly though it might have a decorative grace his finding me here in presence of it might be more flagrantly disagreeable for all of us than you intend or than would necessarily help us and i must take time truly to understand what it means you re safe as far as that goes maggie returned you may take it from me that he won t come in and that i shall only find him below waiting for me when i go down to the carriage fanny assingham took it from her took it and more we re to sit together at the ambassador s then or at least you two are with this new complication thrust up before you all unexplained and to look at each other with faces that pretend for the ghastly hour not to be seeing it maggie looked at her with a face that might have been the one she was preparing unexplained my dear quite the contrary explained fully intensely admirably explained with nothing really to add my own love she kept it up i don t want anything more i ve plenty to go upon and to do with as it is fanny assingham stood there in her comparative darkness with her links verily still missing but the most acceptable effect of this was singularly as yet a cold fear of getting nearer the fact but when you come home i mean he ll come up with you again won t he see it then on which maggie gave her after an instant s visible thought the strangest of slow headshakes i don t know perhaps he ll never see it if it only stands there waiting for him he may never again said the princess come into this room fanny more deeply wondered never again oh yes it may be how do i know with this she quietly went on she had not looked again at the incriminating piece but there was a marvel to her friend in the way the little word representing it seemed to express and include for her the whole of her situation then you intend not to speak to him maggie waited to speak well about your having it and about what you consider that it represents oh i don t know that i shall speak if he doesn t but his keeping away from me because of that what will that be but to speak he can t say or do more it won t be for me to speak maggie added in a different tone one of the tones that had already so penetrated her guest it will be for me to listen mrs assingham turned it over then it all depends on that object that you regard for your reasons as evidence i think i may say that i depend on it i can t said maggie treat it as nothing now mrs assingham at this went closer to the cup on the chimney quite liking to feel that she did so moreover without going closer to her companion s vision she looked at the precious thing if precious it was found herself in fact eyeing it as if by her dim solicitation to draw its secret from it rather than suffer the imposition of maggie s knowledge it was brave and rich and firm with its bold deep hollow and without this queer torment about it would thanks to her love of plenty of yellow figure to her as an enviable ornament a possession really desirable she didn t touch it but if after a minute she turned away from it the reason was rather oddly and suddenly in her fear of doing so then it all depends on the bowl i mean your future does for that s what it comes to i judge what it comes to maggie presently returned is what that thing has put me so almost miraculously in the way of learning how far they had originally gone together if there was so much between them before there can t with all the other appearances not be a great deal more now and she went on and on she steadily made her points if such things were already then between them they make all the difference for possible doubt of what may have been between them since if there had been nothing before there might be explanations but it makes to day too much to explain i mean to explain away she said fanny assingham was there to explain away of this she was duly conscious for that at least had been true up to now in the light however of maggie s demonstration the quantity even without her taking as yet a more exact measure might well seem larger than ever besides which with or without exactness the effect of each successive minute in the place was to put her more in presence of what maggie herself saw maggie herself saw the truth and that was really while they remained there together enough for mrs assingham s relation to it there was a force in the princess s mere manner about it that made the detail of what she knew a matter of minor importance fanny had in fact something like a momentary shame over her own need of asking for this detail i don t pretend to repudiate she said after a little my own impressions of the different times i suppose you speak of any more she added than i can forget what difficulties and as it constantly seemed to me what dangers every course of action whatever i should decide upon made for me i tried i tried hard to act for the best and you know she next pursued while at the sound of her own statement a slow courage and even a faint warmth of conviction came back to her and you know i believe it s what i shall turn out to have done this produced a minute during which their interchange though quickened and deepened was that of silence only and the long charged look all of which found virtual consecration when maggie at last spoke i m sure you tried to act for the best it kept fanny assingham again a minute in silence i never thought dearest you weren t an angel not however that this alone was much help it was up to the very eve you see the princess went on up to within two or three days of our marriage that that you know and she broke down for strangely smiling yes as i say it was while she was with me but i didn t know it that is said fanny assingham i didn t know of anything in particular it sounded weak that she felt but she had really her point to make what i mean is that i don t know for knowledge now anything i didn t then that s how i am she still however floundered i mean it s how i was but don t they how you were and how you are maggie asked come practically to the same thing the elder woman s words had struck her own ear as in the tone now mistimed of their recent but all too factitious understanding arrived at in hours when as there was nothing susceptible of proof there was nothing definitely to disprove the situation had changed by well by whatever there was by the outbreak of the definite and this could keep maggie at least firm she was firm enough as she pursued it was on the whole thing that amerigo married me with which her eyes had their turn again at her damnatory piece and it was on that it was on that but they came back to her visitor and it was on it all that father married her her visitor took it as might be they both married ah that you must believe with the highest intentions father did certainly and then at the renewal of this consciousness it all rolled over her ah to thrust such things on us to do them here between us and with us day after day and in return in return to do it to him to him to him fanny hesitated you mean it s for him you most suffer and then as the princess after a look but turned away moving about the room which made the question somehow seem a blunder i ask she continued because i think everything everything we now speak of may be for him really may be made for him quite as if it hadn t been but maggie had the next moment faced about as if without hearing her father did it for me did it all and only for me mrs assingham with a certain promptness threw up her head but she faltered again before she spoke well it was only an intended word but maggie showed after an instant that it had reached her do you mean that that s the reason that that s a reason fanny at first however feeling the response in this didn t say all she meant she said for the moment something else instead he did it for you largely at least for you and it was for you that i did in my smaller interested way well what i could do for i could do something she continued i thought i saw your interest as he himself saw it and i thought i saw charlotte s i believed in her and i believed in her said maggie mrs assingham waited again but she presently pushed on she believed then in herself ah maggie murmured something exquisite faintly eager in the prompt simplicity of it supported her friend further and the prince believed his belief was real just as he believed in himself maggie spent a minute in taking it from her he believed in himself just as i too believed in him for i absolutely did maggie to which fanny then added and i believe in him yet i mean she subjoined well i mean i do maggie again took it from her after which she was again restlessly set afloat then when this had come to an end and do you believe in charlotte yet mrs assingham had a demur that she felt she could now afford we ll talk of charlotte some other day they both at any rate thought themselves safe at the time then why did they keep from me everything i might have known her friend bent upon her the mildest eyes why did i myself keep it from you oh you weren t for honour obliged dearest maggie the poor woman broke out on this you are divine they pretended to love me the princess went on and they pretended to love him and pray what was there that i didn t pretend not at any rate to care for me as you cared for amerigo and for charlotte they were much more interesting it was perfectly natural how couldn t you like amerigo maggie continued mrs assingham gave it up how couldn t i how couldn t i then with a fine freedom she went all her way how can t i how can t i it fixed afresh maggie s wide eyes on her i see i see well it s beautiful for you to be able to and of course she added you wanted to help charlotte yes fanny considered it i wanted to help charlotte but i wanted also you see to help you by not digging up a past that i believed with so much on top of it solidly buried i wanted as i still want she richly declared to help every one it set maggie once more in movement movement which however spent itself again with a quick emphasis then it s a good deal my fault if everything really began so well fanny assingham met it as she could you ve been only too perfect you ve thought only too much but the princess had already caught at the words yes i ve thought only too much yet she appeared to continue for the minute full of that fault she had it in fact by this prompted thought all before her of him dear man of him her friend able to take in thus directly her vision of her father watched her with a new suspense that way might safety lie it was like a wider chink of light he believed with a beauty in charlotte yes and it was i who had made him believe i didn t mean to at the time so much for i had no idea then of what was coming but i did it i did it the princess declared with a beauty ah with a beauty you too mrs assingham insisted maggie however was seeing for herself it was another matter the thing was that he made her think it would be so possible fanny again hesitated the prince made her think maggie stared she had meant her father but her vision seemed to spread they both made her think she wouldn t have thought without them yet amerigo s good faith mrs assingham insisted was perfect and there was nothing all the more she added against your father s the remark however kept maggie for a moment still nothing perhaps but his knowing that she knew knew that he was doing it so much for me to what extent she suddenly asked of her friend do you think he was aware that she knew ah who can say what passes between people in such a relation the only thing one can be sure of is that he was generous and mrs assingham conclusively smiled he doubtless knew as much as was right for himself as much that is as was right for her yes then as was right for her the point is fanny declared that whatever his knowledge it made all the way it went for his good faith maggie continued to gaze and her friend now fairly waited on her successive movements isn t the point very considerably that his good faith must have been his faith in her taking almost as much interest in me as he himself took fanny assingham thought he recognised he adopted your long friendship but he founded on it no selfishness no said maggie with still deeper consideration he counted her selfishness out almost as he counted his own so you may say very well maggie went on if he had none of his own he invited her may have expected her on her side to have as little and she may only since have found that out mrs assingham looked blank since and he may have become aware maggie pursued that she has found it out that she has taken the measure since their marriage she explained of how much he had asked of her more say than she had understood at the time he may have made out at last how such a demand was in the long run to affect her he may have done many things mrs assingham responded but there s one thing he certainly won t have done he ll never have shown that he expected of her a quarter as much as she must have understood he was to give i ve often wondered maggie mused what charlotte really understood but it s one of the things she has never told me then as it s one of the things she has never told me either we shall probably never know it and we may regard it as none of our business there are many things said mrs assingham that we shall never know maggie took it in with a long reflection never but there are others her friend went on that stare us in the face and that under whatever difficulty you may feel you labour may now be enough for us your father has been extraordinary it had been as if maggie were feeling her way but she rallied to this with a rush extraordinary magnificent said fanny assingham her companion held tight to it magnificent then he ll do for himself whatever there may be to do what he undertook for you he ll do to the end he didn t undertake it to break down in what quiet patient exquisite as he is did he ever break down he had never in his life proposed to himself to have failed and he won t have done it on this occasion ah this occasion and maggie s wail showed her of a sudden thrown back on it am i in the least sure that with everything he even knows what it is and yet am i in the least sure he doesn t if he doesn t then so much the better leave him alone do you mean give him up leave her fanny assingham went on leave her to him maggie looked at her darkly do you mean leave him to her after this after everything aren t they for that matter intimately together now intimately how do i know but fanny kept it up aren t you and your husband in spite of everything maggie s eyes still further if possible dilated it remains to be seen if you re not then where s your faith in my husband mrs assingham but for an instant hesitated in your father it all comes back to that rest on it on his ignorance fanny met it again on whatever he may offer you take that take it maggie stared mrs assingham held up her head and be grateful on which for a minute she let the princess face her do you see i see said maggie at last then there you are but maggie had turned away moving to the window as if still to keep something in her face from sight she stood there with her eyes on the street while mrs assingham s reverted to that complicating object on the chimney as to which her condition so oddly even to herself was that both of recurrent wonder and recurrent protest she went over it looked at it afresh and yielded now to her impulse to feel it in her hands she laid them on it lifting it up and was surprised thus with the weight of it she had seldom handled so much massive gold that effect itself somehow prompted her to further freedom and presently to saying i don t believe in this you know it brought maggie round to her don t believe in it you will when i tell you ah tell me nothing i won t have it said mrs assingham she kept the cup in her hand held it there in a manner that gave maggie s attention to her she saw the next moment a quality of excited suspense this suggested to her oddly that she had with the liberty she was taking an air of intention and the impression betrayed by her companion s eyes grew more distinct in a word of warning it s of value but its value s impaired i ve learned by a crack a crack in the gold it isn t gold with which somewhat strangely maggie smiled that s the point what is it then it s glass and cracked under the gilt as i say at that glass of this weight well said maggie it s crystal and was once i suppose precious but what she then asked do you mean to do with it she had come away from her window one of the three by which the wide room enjoying an advantageous back commanded the western sky and caught a glimpse of the evening flush while mrs assingham possessed of the bowl and possessed too of this indication of a flaw approached another for the benefit of the slowly fading light here thumbing the singular piece weighing it turning it over and growing suddenly more conscious above all of an irresistible impulse she presently spoke again a crack then your whole idea has a crack maggie by this time at some distance from her waited a moment if you mean by my idea the knowledge that has come to me that but fanny with decision had already taken her up there s only one knowledge that concerns us one fact with which we can have anything to do which one then the fact that your husband has never never never but the very gravity of this statement while she raised her eyes to her friend across the room made her for an instant hang fire well never what never been half so interested in you as now but don t you my dear really feel it maggie considered oh i think what i ve told you helps me to feel it his having to day given up even his forms his keeping away from me his not having come and she shook her head as against all easy glosses it is because of that you know well then if it s because of this and fanny assingham who had been casting about her and whose inspiration decidedly had come raised the cup in her two hands raised it positively above her head and from under it solemnly smiled at the princess as a signal of intention so for an instant full of her thought and of her act she held the precious vessel and then with due note taken of the margin of the polished floor bare fine and hard in the embrasure of her window she dashed it boldly to the ground where she had the thrill of seeing it with the violence of the crash lie shattered she had flushed with the force of her effort as maggie had flushed with wonder at the sight and this high reflection in their faces was all that passed between them for a minute more after which whatever you meant by it and i don t want to know now has ceased to exist mrs assingham said and what in the world my dear did you mean by it that sound as at the touch of a spring rang out as the first effect of fanny s speech it broke upon the two women s absorption with a sharpness almost equal to the smash of the crystal for the door of the room had been opened by the prince without their taking heed he had apparently had time moreover to catch the conclusion of fanny s act his eyes attached themselves through the large space allowing just there as happened a free view to the shining fragments at this lady s feet his question had been addressed to his wife but he moved his eyes immediately afterwards to those of her visitor whose own then held them in a manner of which neither party had been capable doubtless for mute penetration since the hour spent by him in cadogan place on the eve of his marriage and the afternoon of charlotte s reappearance something now again became possible for these communicants under the intensity of their pressure something that took up that tale and that might have been a redemption of pledges then exchanged this rapid play of suppressed appeal and disguised response lasted indeed long enough for more results than one long enough for mrs assingham to measure the feat of quick self recovery possibly therefore of recognition still more immediate accompanying amerigo s vision and estimate of the evidence with which she had been so admirably she felt as she looked at him inspired to deal she looked at him and looked at him there were so many things she wanted on the spot to say but maggie was looking too and was moreover looking at them both so that these things for the elder woman quickly enough reduced themselves to one she met his question not too late since in their silence it had remained in the air gathering herself to go leaving the golden bowl split into three pieces on the ground she simply referred him to his wife she should see them later they would all meet soon again and meanwhile as to what maggie had meant she said in her turn from the door why maggie herself was doubtless by this time ready to tell him xxxiv left with her husband maggie however for the time said nothing she only felt on the spot a strong sharp wish not to see his face again till he should have had a minute to arrange it she had seen it enough for her temporary clearness and her next movement seen it as it showed during the stare of surprise that followed his entrance then it was that she knew how hugely expert she had been made for judging it quickly by that vision of it indelibly registered for reference that had flashed a light into her troubled soul the night of his late return from matcham the expression worn by it at that juncture for however few instants had given her a sense of its possibilities one of the most relevant of which might have been playing up for her before the consummation of fanny assingham s retreat just long enough to be recognised what she had recognised in it was his recognition the result of his having been forced by the flush of their visitor s attitude and the unextinguished report of her words to take account of the flagrant signs of the accident of the incident on which he had unexpectedly dropped he had not unnaturally failed to see this occurrence represented by the three fragments of an object apparently valuable which lay there on the floor and which even across the width of the room his kept interval reminded him unmistakably though confusedly of something known some other unforgotten image that was a mere shock that was a pain as if fanny s violence had been a violence redoubled and acting beyond its intention a violence calling up the hot blood as a blow across the mouth might have called it maggie knew as she turned away from him that she didn t want his pain what she wanted was her own simple certainty not the red mark of conviction flaming there in his beauty if she could have gone on with bandaged eyes she would have liked that best if it were a question of saying what she now apparently should have to and of taking from him what he would say any blindness that might wrap it would be the nearest approach to a boon she went in silence to where her friend never in intention visibly so much her friend as at that moment had braced herself to so amazing an energy and there under amerigo s eyes she picked up the shining pieces bedizened and jewelled in her rustling finery she paid with humility of attitude this prompt tribute to order only to find however that she could carry but two of the fragments at once she brought them over to the chimney piece to the conspicuous place occupied by the cup before fanny s appropriation of it and after laying them carefully down went back for what remained the solid detached foot with this she returned to the mantel shelf placing it with deliberation in the centre and then for a minute occupying herself as with the attempt to fit the other morsels after she had squared again her little objects on the chimney she was within an ace in fact of turning on him with that appeal besides its being lucid for her all the while that the occasion was passing that they were dining out that he wasn t dressed and that though she herself was she was yet in all probability so horribly red in the face and so awry in many ways with agitation that in view of the ambassador s company of possible comments and constructions she should need before her glass some restoration of appearances amerigo meanwhile after all could clearly make the most of her having enjoined on him to wait suggested it by the positive pomp of her dealings with the smashed cup to wait that is till she should pronounce as mrs assingham had promised for her this delay again certainly tested her presence of mind though that strain was not what presently made her speak keep her eyes for the time from her husband s as she might she soon found herself much more drivingly conscious of the strain on his own wit there was even a minute when her back was turned to him during which she knew once more the strangeness of her desire to spare him a strangeness that had already fifty times brushed her in the depth of her trouble as with the wild wing of some bird of the air who might blindly have swooped for an instant into the shaft of a well darkening there by his momentary flutter the far off round of sky it was extraordinary this quality in the taste of her wrong which made her completed sense of it seem rather to soften than to harden and it was the more extraordinary the more she had to recognise it for what it came to was that seeing herself finally sure knowing everything having the fact in all its abomination so utterly before her that there was nothing else to add what it came to was that merely by being with him there in silence she felt within her the sudden split between conviction and action they had begun to cease on the spot surprisingly to be connected conviction that is budged no inch only planting its feet the more firmly in the soil but action began to hover like some lighter and larger but easier form excited by its very power to keep above ground it would be free it would be independent it would go in wouldn t it for some prodigious and superior adventure of its own what would condemn it so to speak to the responsibility of freedom this glimmered on maggie even now was the possibility richer with every lapsing moment that her husband would have on the whole question a new need of her a need which was in fact being born between them in these very seconds it struck her truly as so new that he would have felt hitherto none to compare with it at all would indeed absolutely by this circumstance be really needing her for the first one in their whole connection no he had used her had even exceedingly enjoyed her before this but there had been no precedent for that character of a proved necessity to him which she was rapidly taking on the immense advantage of this particular clue moreover was that she should have now to arrange alter to falsify nothing should have to be but consistently simple and straight she asked herself with concentration while her back was still presented what would be the very ideal of that method after which the next instant it had all come to her and she had turned round upon him for the application fanny assingham broke it knowing it had a crack and that it would go if she used sufficient force she thought when i had told her that that would be the best thing to do with it thought so from her own point of view that hadn t been at all my idea but she acted before i understood i had on the contrary she explained put it here in full view exactly that you might see he stood with his hands in his pockets he had carried his eyes to the fragments on the chimney piece and she could already distinguish the element of relief absolutely of succour in his acceptance from her of the opportunity to consider the fruits of their friend s violence every added inch of reflection and delay having the advantage from this point on of counting for him double it had operated within her now to the last intensity her glimpse of the precious truth that by her helping him helping him to help himself as it were she should help him to help her hadn t she fairly got into his labyrinth with him wasn t she indeed in the very act of placing herself there for him at its centre and core whence on that definite orientation and by an instinct all her own she might securely guide him out of it she offered him thus assuredly a kind of support that was not to have been imagined in advance and that moreover required ah most truly some close looking at before it could be believed in and pronounced void of treachery yes look look she seemed to see him hear her say even while her sounded words were other look look both at the truth that still survives in that smashed evidence and at the even more remarkable appearance that i m not such a fool as you supposed me look at the possibility that since i am different there may still be something in it for you if you re capable of working with me to get that out consider of course as you must the question of what you may have to surrender on your side what price you may have to pay whom you may have to pay with to set this advantage free but take in at any rate that there is something for you if you don t too blindly spoil your chance for it he went no nearer the damnatory pieces but he eyed them from where he stood with a degree of recognition just visibly less to be dissimulated all of which represented for her a certain traceable process and her uttered words meanwhile were different enough from those he might have inserted between the lines of her already spoken it s the golden bowl you know that you saw at the little antiquario s in bloomsbury so long ago when you went there with charlotte when you spent those hours with her unknown to me a day or two before our marriage it was shown you both but you didn t take it you left it for me and i came upon it extraordinarily through happening to go into the same shop on monday last in walking home in prowling about to pick up some small old thing for father s birthday after my visit to the museum my appointment there with mr crichton of which i told you it was shown me and i was struck with it and took it knowing nothing about it at the time what i now know i ve learned since i learned this afternoon a couple of hours ago receiving from it naturally a great impression so there it is in its three pieces you can handle them don t be afraid if you want to make sure the thing is the thing you and charlotte saw together its having come apart makes an unfortunate difference for its beauty its artistic value but none for anything else its other value is just the same i mean that of its having given me so much of the truth about you i don t therefore so much care what becomes of it now unless perhaps you may yourself when you come to think have some good use for it in that case maggie wound up we can easily take the pieces with us to fawns it was wonderful how she felt by the time she had seen herself through this narrow pass that she had really achieved something that she was emerging a little in fine with the prospect less contracted she had done for him that is what her instinct enjoined had laid a basis not merely momentary on which he could meet her when by the turn of his head he did finally meet her this was the last thing that glimmered out of his look but it came into sight none the less as a perception of his distress and almost as a question of his eyes so that for still another minute before he committed himself there occurred between them a kind of unprecedented moral exchange over which her superior lucidity presided it was not however that when he did commit himself the show was promptly portentous but what in the world has fanny assingham had to do with it she could verily out of all her smothered soreness almost have smiled his question so affected her as giving the whole thing up to her but it left her only to go the straighter she has had to do with it that i immediately sent for her and that she immediately came she was the first person i wanted to see because i knew she would know know more about what i had learned i mean than i could make out for myself i made out as much as i could for myself that i also wanted to have done but it didn t in spite of everything take me very far and she has really been a help not so much as she would like to be not so much as poor dear she just now tried to be yet she has done her very best for you never forget that and has kept me along immeasurably better than i should have been able to come without her she has gained me time and that these three months don t you see has been everything she had said don t you see on purpose and was to feel the next moment that it had acted these three months the prince asked counting from the night you came home so late from matcham counting from the hours you spent with charlotte at gloucester your visit to the cathedral which you won t have forgotten describing to me in so much detail for that was the beginning of my being sure before it i had been sufficiently in doubt sure maggie developed of your having and of your having for a long time had two relations with charlotte he stared a little at sea as he took it up two something in the tone of it gave it a sense or an ambiguity almost foolish leaving maggie to feel as in a flash how such a consequence a foredoomed infelicity partaking of the ridiculous even in one of the cleverest might be of the very essence of the penalty of wrong doing oh you may have had fifty had the same relation with her fifty times it s of the number of kinds of relation with her that i speak a number that doesn t matter really so long as there wasn t only one kind as father and i supposed one kind she went on was there before us we took that fully for granted as you saw and accepted it we never thought of there being another kept out of our sight but after the evening i speak of i knew there was something else as i say i had before that my idea which you never dreamed i had from the moment i speak of it had more to go upon and you became yourselves you and she vaguely yet uneasily conscious of the difference but it s within these last hours that i ve most seen where we are and as i ve been in communication with fanny assingham about my doubts so i wanted to let her know my certainty with the determination of which however you must understand she has had nothing to do she defends you maggie remarked he had given her all his attention and with this impression for her again that he was in essence fairly reaching out to her for time time only time she could sufficiently imagine and to whatever strangeness that he absolutely liked her to talk even at the cost of his losing almost everything else by it it was still for a minute as if he waited for something worse wanted everything that was in her to come out any definite fact anything more precisely nameable so that he too as was his right should know where he was what stirred in him above all while he followed in her face the clear train of her speech must have been the impulse to take up something she put before him that he was yet afraid directly to touch he wanted to make free with it but had to keep his hands off for reasons he had already made out and the discomfort of his privation yearned at her out of his eyes with an announcing gleam of the fever the none too tolerable chill of specific recognition she affected him as speaking more or less for her father as well and his eyes might have been trying to hypnotise her into giving him the answer without his asking the question had he his idea and has he now with you anything more those were the words he had to hold himself from not speaking and that she would as yet certainly do nothing to make easy she felt with her sharpest thrill how he was straitened and tied and with the miserable pity of it her present conscious purpose of keeping him so could none the less perfectly accord to name her father on any such basis of anxiety of compunction would be to do the impossible thing to do neither more nor less than give charlotte away visibly palpably traceably he stood off from this moved back from it as from an open chasm now suddenly perceived but which had been between the two with so much so strangely much else quite uncalculated verily it towered before her this history of their confidence they had built strong and piled high based as it was on such appearances their conviction that thanks to her native complacencies of so many sorts she would always quite to the end and through and through take them as nobly sparing her amerigo was at any rate having the sensation of a particular ugliness to avoid a particular difficulty to count with that practically found him as unprepared as if he had been like his wife an abjectly simple person and she meanwhile however abjectly simple was further discerning for herself that whatever he might have to take from her she being on her side beautifully free he would absolutely not be able for any qualifying purpose to name charlotte either as his father in law s wife mrs verver rose between them there for the time in august and prohibitive form to protect her defend her explain about her was at the least to bring her into the question which would be by the same stroke to bring her husband but this was exactly the door maggie wouldn t open to him on all of which she was the next moment asking herself if thus warned and embarrassed he were not fairly writhing in his pain he writhed on that hypothesis some seconds more for it was not till then that he had chosen between what he could do and what he couldn t you re apparently drawing immense conclusions from very small matters won t you perhaps feel in fairness that you re striking out triumphing or whatever i may call it rather too easily feel it when i perfectly admit that your smashed cup there does come back to me i frankly confess now to the occasion and to having wished not to speak of it to you at the time we took two or three hours together by arrangement it was on the eve of my marriage at the moment you say but that put it on the eve of yours too my dear which was directly the point it was desired to find for you at the eleventh hour some small wedding present a hunt for something worth giving you and yet possible from other points of view as well in which it seemed i could be of use you were naturally not to be told precisely because it was all for you we went forth together and we looked we rummaged about and as i remember we called it we prowled then it was that as i freely recognise we came across that crystal cup which i m bound to say upon my honour i think it rather a pity fanny assingham from whatever good motive should have treated so he had kept his hands in his pockets he turned his eyes again but more complacently now to the ruins of the precious vessel and maggie could feel him exhale into the achieved quietness of his explanation a long deep breath of comparative relief behind everything beneath everything it was somehow a comfort to him at last to be talking with her and he seemed to be proving to himself that he could talk it was at a little shop in bloomsbury i think i could go to the place now the man understood italian i remember he wanted awfully to work off his bowl but i didn t believe in it and we didn t take it maggie had listened with an interest that wore all the expression of candour oh you left it for me but what did you take he looked at her first as if he were trying to remember then as if he might have been trying to forget nothing i think at that place what did you take then at any other what did you get me since that was your aim and end for a wedding gift the prince continued very nobly to bethink himself didn t we get you anything maggie waited a little she had for some time now kept her eyes on him steadily but they wandered at this to the fragments on her chimney yes it comes round after all to your having got me the bowl i myself was to come upon it the other day by so wonderful a chance was to find it in the same place and to have it pressed upon me by the same little man who does as you say understand italian i did believe in it you see must have believed in it somehow instinctively for i took it as soon as i saw it though i didn t know at all then she added what i was taking with it the prince paid her for an instant visibly the deference of trying to imagine what this might have been i agree with you that the coincidence is extraordinary the sort of thing that happens mainly in novels and plays but i don t see you must let me say the importance or the connexion of my having made the purchase where you failed of it she had quickly taken him up but she had with her eyes on him once more another drop into the order of her thoughts to which through whatever he might say she was still adhering it s not my having gone into the place at the end of four years that makes the strangeness of the coincidence for don t such chances as that in london easily occur the strangeness she lucidly said is in what my purchase was to represent to me after i had got it home which value came she explained from the wonder of my having found such a friend such a friend as a wonder assuredly her husband could but take it as the little man in the shop he did for me more than he knew i owe it to him he took an interest in me maggie said and taking that interest he recalled your visit he remembered you and spoke of you to me on which the prince passed the comment of a sceptical smile ah but my dear if extraordinary things come from people s taking an interest in you my life in that case she asked must be very agitated well he liked me i mean very particularly it s only so i can account for my afterwards hearing from him and in fact he gave me that to day she pursued he gave me it frankly as his reason to day the prince inquiringly echoed but she was singularly able it had been marvellously given her she afterwards said to herself to abide for her light for her clue by her own order i inspired him with sympathy there you are but the miracle is that he should have a sympathy to offer that could be of use to me that was really the oddity of my chance the princess proceeded that i should have been moved in my ignorance to go precisely to him he saw her so keep her course that it was as if he could at the best but stand aside to watch her and let her pass he only made a vague demonstration that was like an ineffective gesture i m sorry to say any ill of your friends and the thing was a long time ago besides which there was nothing to make me recur to it but i remember the man s striking me as a decided little beast she gave a slow headshake as if no after consideration not that way were an issue i can only think of him as kind for he had nothing to gain he had in fact only to lose it was what he came to tell me that he had asked me too high a price more than the object was really worth there was a particular reason which he hadn t mentioned and which had made him consider and repent he wrote for leave to see me again wrote in such terms that i saw him here this afternoon here it made the prince look about him downstairs in the little red room while he was waiting he looked at the few photographs that stand about there and recognised two of them though it was so long ago he remembered the visit made him by the lady and the gentleman and that gave him his connexion it gave me mine for he remembered everything and told me everything you see you too had produced your effect only unlike you he had thought of it again he had recurred to it he told me of your having wished to make each other presents but of that s not having come off the lady was greatly taken with the piece i had bought of him but you had your reason against receiving it from her and you had been right he would think that of you more than ever now maggie went on he would see how wisely you had guessed the flaw and how easily the bowl could be broken i had bought it myself you see for a present he knew i was doing that this was what had worked in him especially after the price i had paid her story had dropped an instant she still brought it out in small waves of energy each of which spent its force so that he had an opportunity to speak before this force was renewed but the quaint thing was what he now said and what pray was the price she paused again a little it was high certainly for those fragments i think i feel as i look at them there rather ashamed to say the prince then again looked at them he might have been growing used to the sight but shall you at least get your money back oh i m far from wanting it back i feel so that i m getting its worth with which before he could reply she had a quick transition the great fact about the day we re talking of seems to me to have been quite remarkably that no present was then made me if your undertaking had been for that that was not at least what came of it you received then nothing at all the prince looked vague and grave almost retrospectively concerned nothing but an apology for empty hands and empty pockets which was made me as if it mattered a mite ever so frankly ever so beautifully and touchingly this amerigo heard with interest yet not with confusion ah of course you couldn t have minded distinctly as she went on he was getting the better of the mere awkwardness of his arrest quite as if making out that he need suffer arrest from her now before they should go forth to show themselves in the world together in no greater quantity than an occasion ill chosen at the best for a scene might decently make room for he looked at his watch their engagement all the while remained before him but i don t make out you see what case against me you rest on everything i m telling you why the whole case the case of your having for so long so successfully deceived me the idea of your finding something for me charming as that would have been was what had least to do with your taking a morning together at that moment what had really to do with it said maggie was that you had to you couldn t not from the moment you were again face to face and the reason of that was that there had been so much between you before before i came between you at all her husband had been for these last moments moving about under her eyes but at this as to check any show of impatience he again stood still you ve never been more sacred to me than you were at that hour unless perhaps you ve become so at this one the assurance of his speech she could note quite held up its head in him his eyes met her own so for the declaration that it was as if something cold and momentarily unimaginable breathed upon her from afar off out of his strange consistency she kept her direction still however under that oh the thing i ve known best of all is that you ve never wanted together to offend us you ve wanted quite intensely not to and the precautions you ve had to take for it have been for a long time one of the strongest of my impressions that i think she added is the way i ve best known known he repeated after a moment known known that you were older friends and so much more intimate ones than i had any reason to suppose when we married known there were things that hadn t been told me and that gave their meaning little by little to other things that were before me would they have made a difference in the matter of our marriage the prince presently asked if you had known them she took her time to think i grant you not in the matter of ours and then as he again fixed her with his hard yearning which he couldn t keep down the question is so much bigger than that you see how much what i know makes of it for me that was what acted on him this iteration of her knowledge into the question of the validity of the various bearings of which he couldn t on the spot trust himself to pretend in any high way to go what her claim as she made it represented for him that he couldn t help betraying if only as a consequence of the effect of the word itself her repeated distinct know know on his nerves she was capable of being sorry for his nerves at a time when he should need them for dining out pompously rather responsibly without his heart in it yet she was not to let that prevent her using with all economy so precious a chance for supreme clearness i didn t force this upon you you must recollect and it probably wouldn t have happened for you if you hadn t come in ah said the prince i was liable to come in you know i didn t think you were this evening and why not well she answered you have many liabilities of different sorts with which she recalled what she had said to fanny assingham and then you re so deep it produced in his features in spite of his control of them one of those quick plays of expression the shade of a grimace that testified as nothing else did to his race it s you cara who are deep which after an instant she had accepted from him she could so feel at last that it was true then i shall have need of it all but what would you have done he was by this time asking if i hadn t come in i don t know she had hesitated what would you oh io that isn t the question i depend upon you i go on you would have spoken to morrow i think i would have waited and for what he asked to see what difference it would make for myself my possession at last i mean of real knowledge oh said the prince my only point now at any rate she went on is the difference as i say that it may make for you your knowing was from the moment you did come in all i had in view and she sounded it again he should have it once more your knowing that i ve ceased that you ve ceased with her pause in fact she had fairly made him press her for it why to be as i was not to know it was once more then after a little that he had had to stand receptive yet the singular effect of this was that there was still something of the same sort he was made to want he had another hesitation but at last this odd quantity showed then does any one else know it was as near as he could come to naming her father and she kept him at that distance any one any one i mean but fanny assingham i should have supposed you had had by this time particular means of learning i don t see she said why you ask me then after an instant and only after an instant as she saw he made out what she meant and it gave her all strangely enough the still further light that charlotte for herself knew as little as he had known the vision loomed in this light it fairly glared for the few seconds the vision of the two others alone together at fawns and charlotte as one of them having gropingly to go on always not knowing and not knowing the picture flushed at the same time with all its essential colour that of the so possible identity of her father s motive and principle with her own he was deep as amerigo called it so that no vibration of the still air should reach his daughter just as she had earned that description by making and by for that matter intending still to make her care for his serenity or at any rate for the firm outer shell of his dignity all marvellous enamel her paramount law more strangely even than anything else her husband seemed to speak now but to help her in this i know nothing but what you tell me then i ve told you all i intended find out the rest find it out he waited she stood before him a moment it took that time to go on depth upon depth of her situation as she met his face surged and sank within her but with the effect somehow once more that they rather lifted her than let her drop she had her feet somewhere through it all it was her companion absolutely who was at sea and she kept her feet she pressed them to what was beneath her she went over to the bell beside the chimney and gave a ring that he could but take as a summons for her maid it stopped everything for the present it was an intimation to him to go and dress but she had to insist find out for yourself part fifth xxxv after the little party was again constituted at fawns which had taken for completeness some ten days maggie naturally felt herself still more possessed in spirit of everything that had last happened in london there was a phrase that came back to her from old american years she was having by that idiom the time of her life she knew it by the perpetual throb of this sense of possession which was almost too violent either to recognise or to hide it was as if she had come out that was her most general consciousness out of a dark tunnel a dense wood or even simply a smoky room and had thereby at least for going on the advantage of air in her lungs it was as if she were somehow at last gathering in the fruits of patience she had either been really more patient than she had known at the time or had been so for longer the change brought about by itself as great a difference of view as the shift of an inch in the position of a telescope it was her telescope in fact that had gained in range just as her danger lay in her exposing herself to the observation by the more charmed and therefore the more reckless use of this optical resource not under any provocation to produce it in public was her unremitted rule but the difficulties of duplicity had not shrunk while the need of it had doubled humbugging which she had so practised with her father had been a comparatively simple matter on the basis of mere doubt but the ground to be covered was now greatly larger and she felt not unlike some young woman of the theatre who engaged for a minor part in the play and having mastered her cues with anxious effort should find herself suddenly promoted to leading lady and expected to appear in every act of the five she had made much to her husband that last night of her knowing but it was exactly this quantity she now knew that from the moment she could only dissimulate it added to her responsibility and made of the latter all a mere question of having something precious and precarious in charge there was no one to help her with it not even fanny assingham now this good friend s presence having become inevitably with that climax of their last interview in portland place a severely simplified function she had her use oh yes a thousand times but it could only consist henceforth in her quite conspicuously touching at no point whatever assuredly at least with maggie the matter they had discussed she was there inordinately as a value but as a value only for the clear negation of everything she was their general sign precisely of unimpaired beatitude and she was to live up to that somewhat arduous character poor thing as she might she might privately lapse from it if she must with amerigo or with charlotte only not of course ever so much as for the wink of an eye with the master of the house such lapses would be her own affair which maggie at present could take no thought of she treated her young friend meanwhile it was to be said to no betrayal of such wavering so that from the moment of her alighting at the door with the colonel everything went on between them at concert pitch what had she done that last evening in maggie s room but bring the husband and wife more together than as would seem they had ever been therefore what indiscretion should she not show by attempting to go behind the grand appearance of her success which would be to court a doubt of her beneficent work she knew accordingly nothing but harmony and diffused restlessly nothing but peace an extravagant expressive aggressive peace not incongruous after all with the solid calm of the place a kind of helmetted trident shaking pax britannica the peace it must be added had become as the days elapsed a peace quite generally animated and peopled thanks to that fact of the presence of company in which maggie s ability to preserve an appearance had learned from so far back to find its best resource it was not inconspicuous it was in fact striking that this resource just now seemed to meet in the highest degree every one s need quite as if every one were by the multiplication of human objects in the scene by the creation by the confusion of fictive issues hopeful of escaping somebody else s notice it had reached the point in truth that the collective bosom might have been taken to heave with the knowledge of the descent upon adjacent shores for a short period of mrs rance and the lutches still united and still so divided for conquest the sense of the party showed at least oddly enough as favourable to the fancy of the quaint turn that some near week end might derive from their reappearance this measured for maggie the ground they had all travelled together since that unforgotten afternoon of the none so distant year that determinant september sunday when sitting with her father in the park as in commemoration of the climax both of their old order and of their old danger she had proposed to him that they should call in charlotte call her in as a specialist might be summoned to an invalid s chair wasn t it a sign of something rather portentous their being ready to be beholden as for a diversion to the once despised kitty and dotty that had already had its application in truth to her invocation of the castledeans and several other members again of the historic matcham week made before she left town and made always consistently with an idea since she was never henceforth to approach these people without an idea and since that lurid element of their intercourse grew and grew for her with each occasion the flame with which it burned afresh during these particular days the way it held up the torch to anything to everything that might have occurred as the climax of revels springing from traditions so vivified this by itself justified her private motive and reconsecrated her diplomacy she had already produced by the aid of these people something of the effect she sought that of being good for whatever her companions were good for and of not asking either of them to give up anyone or anything for her sake there was moreover frankly a sharpness of point in it that she enjoyed it gave an accent to the truth she wished to illustrate the truth that the surface of her recent life thick sown with the flower of earnest endeavour with every form of the unruffled and the undoubting suffered no symptom anywhere to peep out it was as if under her pressure neither party could get rid of the complicity as it might be figured of the other as if in a word she saw amerigo and charlotte committed for fear of betrayals on their own side to a kind of wan consistency on the subject of lady castledean s set and this latter group by the same stroke compelled to assist at attestations the extent and bearing of which they rather failed to grasp and which left them indeed in spite of hereditary high spirits a trifle bewildered and even a trifle scared they made none the less at fawns for number for movement for sound they played their parts during a crisis that must have hovered for them in the long passages of the old house after the fashion of the established ghost felt through the dark hours as a constant possibility rather than have menaced them in the form of a daylight bore one of the perceived outsiders who are liable to be met in the drawing room or to be sat next to at dinner if the princess moreover had failed of her occult use for so much of the machinery of diversion she would still have had a sense not other than sympathetic for the advantage now extracted from it by fanny assingham s bruised philosophy this good friend s relation to it was actually the revanche she sufficiently indicated of her obscured lustre at matcham where she had known her way about so much less than most of the others she knew it at fawns through the pathless wild of the right tone positively better than any one maggie could note for her and her revenge had the magnanimity of a brave pointing out of it to every one else a wonderful irresistible conscious almost compassionate patronage here was a house she triumphantly caused it to be noted in which she so bristled with values that some of them might serve by her amused willingness to share for such of the temporarily vague among her fellow guests such of the dimly disconcerted as had lost the key to their own it may have been partly through the effect of this especial strain of community with her old friend that maggie found herself one evening moved to take up again their dropped directness of reference they had remained downstairs together late the other women of the party had filed singly or in couples up the grand staircase on which from the equally grand hall these retreats and advances could always be pleasantly observed the men had apparently taken their way to the smoking room while the princess in possession thus of a rare reach of view had lingered as if to enjoy it then she saw that mrs assingham was remaining a little and as for the appreciation of her enjoyment upon which they stood looking at each other across the cleared prospect until the elder woman only vaguely expressive and tentative now came nearer it was like the act of asking if there were anything she could yet do and that question was answered by her immediately feeling on this closer view as she had felt when presenting herself in portland place after maggie s last sharp summons their understanding was taken up by these new snatched moments where that occasion had left it he has never told her that i know of that i m at last satisfied and then as mrs assingham opened wide eyes i ve been in the dark since we came down not understanding what he has been doing or intending not making out what can have passed between them but within a day or two i ve begun to suspect and this evening for reasons oh too many to tell you i ve been sure since it explains nothing has passed between them that s what has happened it explains the princess repeated with energy it explains it explains she spoke in a manner that her auditor was afterwards to describe to the colonel oddly enough as that of the quietest excitement she had turned back to the chimney place where in honour of a damp day and a chill night the piled logs had turned to flame and sunk to embers and the evident intensity of her vision for the fact she imparted made fanny assingham wait upon her words it explained this striking fact more indeed than her companion though conscious of fairly gaping with good will could swallow at once the princess however as for indulgence and confidence quickly filled up the measure he hasn t let her know that i know and clearly doesn t mean to he has made up his mind he ll say nothing about it therefore as she s quite unable to arrive at the knowledge by herself she has no idea how much i m really in possession she believes said maggie and so far as her own conviction goes she knows that i m not in possession of anything and that somehow for my own help seems to me immense immense my dear mrs assingham applausively murmured though not quite even as yet seeing all the way he s keeping quiet then on purpose on purpose maggie s lighted eyes at least looked further than they had ever looked he ll never tell her now fanny wondered she cast about her most of all she admired her little friend in whom this announcement was evidently animated by an heroic lucidity she stood there in her full uniform like some small erect commander of a siege an anxious captain who has suddenly got news replete with importance for him of agitation of division within the place this importance breathed upon her comrade so you re all right oh all right s a good deal to say but i seem at least to see as i haven t before where i am with it fanny bountifully brooded there was a point left vague and you have it from him your husband himself has told you told me why what you speak of it isn t of an assurance received from him then that you do speak at which maggie had continued to stare dear me no do you suppose i ve asked him for an assurance ah you haven t her companion smiled that s what i supposed you might mean then darling what have you asked him for i ve asked him for nothing but this in turn made fanny stare then nothing that evening of the embassy dinner passed between you on the contrary everything passed everything everything i told him what i knew and i told him how i knew it mrs assingham waited and that was all wasn t it quite enough oh love she bridled that s for you to have judged then i have judged said maggie i did judge i made sure he understood then i let him alone mrs assingham wondered but he didn t explain explain thank god no maggie threw back her head as with horror at the thought then the next moment added and i didn t either the decency of pride in it shed a cold little light yet as from heights at the base of which her companion rather panted but if he neither denies nor confesses he does what s a thousand times better he lets it alone he does maggie went on as he would do as i see now that i was sure he would he lets me alone fanny assingham turned it over then how do you know so where as you say you are why just by that i put him in possession of the difference the difference made about me by the fact that i hadn t been after all though with a wonderful chance i admitted helping me too stupid to have arrived at knowledge he had to see that i m changed for him quite changed from the idea of me that he had so long been going on with it became a question then of his really taking in the change and what i now see is that he is doing so fanny followed as she could which he shows by letting you as you say alone maggie looked at her a minute and by letting her mrs assingham did what she might to embrace it checked a little however by a thought that was the nearest approach she could have in this almost too large air to an inspiration ah but does charlotte let him oh that s another affair with which i ve practically nothing to do i dare say however she doesn t and the princess had a more distant gaze for the image evoked by the question i don t in fact well see how she can but the point for me is that he understands yes fanny assingham cooed understands well what i want i want a happiness without a hole in it big enough for you to poke in your finger a brilliant perfect surface to begin with at least i see the golden bowl as it was to have been and maggie dwelt musingly on this obscured figure the bowl with all our happiness in it the bowl without the crack for mrs assingham too the image had its force and the precious object shone before her again reconstituted plausible presentable but wasn t there still a piece missing yet if he lets you alone and you only let him mayn t our doing so you mean be noticed mayn t it give us away well we hope not we try not we take such care we alone know what s between us we and you and haven t you precisely been struck since you ve been here maggie asked with our making so good a show her friend hesitated to your father but it made her hesitate too she wouldn t speak of her father directly to everyone to her now that you understand it held poor fanny again in wonder to charlotte yes if there s so much beneath it for you and if it s all such a plan that makes it hang together it makes you hang together she fairly exhaled her admiration you re like nobody else you re extraordinary maggie met it with appreciation but with a reserve no i m not extraordinary but i am for every one quiet well that s just what is extraordinary quiet is more than i am and you leave me far behind with which again for an instant mrs assingham frankly brooded now that i understand you say but there s one thing i don t understand and the next minute while her companion waited she had mentioned it how can charlotte after all not have pressed him not have attacked him about it how can she not have asked him asked him on his honour i mean if you know how can she not why of course said the princess limpidly she must well then well then you think he must have told her why exactly what i mean said maggie is that he will have done nothing of the sort will as i say have maintained the contrary fanny assingham weighed it under her direct appeal for the truth under her direct appeal for the truth her appeal to his honour her appeal to his honour that s my point fanny assingham braved it for the truth as from him to her from him to any one mrs assingham s face lighted he ll simply he ll insistently have lied maggie brought it out roundly he ll simply he ll insistently have lied it held again her companion who next however with a single movement throwing herself on her neck overflowed oh if you knew how you help me maggie had liked her to understand so far as this was possible but had not been slow to see afterwards how the possibility was limited when one came to think by mysteries she was not to sound this inability in her was indeed not remarkable inasmuch as the princess herself as we have seen was only now in a position to boast of touching bottom maggie lived inwardly in a consciousness that she could but partly open even to so good a friend and her own visitation of the fuller expanse of which was for that matter still going on they had been duskier still however these recesses of her imagination that no doubt was what might at present be said for them she had looked into them on the eve of her leaving town almost without penetration she had made out in those hours and also of a truth during the days which immediately followed little more than the strangeness of a relation having for its chief mark whether to be prolonged or not the absence of any intimate result of the crisis she had invited her husband to recognise they had dealt with this crisis again face to face very briefly the morning after the scene in her room but with the odd consequence of her having appeared merely to leave it on his hands he had received it from her as he might have received a bunch of keys or a list of commissions attentive to her instructions about them but only putting them for the time very carefully and safely into his pocket the instructions had seemed from day to day to make so little difference for his behaviour that is for his speech or his silence to produce as yet so little of the fruit of action he had taken from her on the spot in a word before going to dress for dinner all she then had to give after which on the morrow he had asked her for more a good deal as if she might have renewed her supply during the night but he had had at his command for this latter purpose an air of extraordinary detachment and discretion an air amounting really to an appeal which if she could have brought herself to describe it vulgarly she would have described as cool just as he himself would have described it in any one else as cheeky a suggestion that she should trust him on the particular ground since she didn t on the general neither his speech nor his silence struck her as signifying more or less under this pressure than they had seemed to signify for weeks past yet if her sense hadn t been absolutely closed to the possibility in him of any thought of wounding her she might have taken his undisturbed manner the perfection of his appearance of having recovered himself for one of those intentions of high impertinence by the aid of which great people les grands seigneurs persons of her husband s class and type always know how to re establish a violated order it was her one purely good fortune that she could feel thus sure impertinence to her at any rate was not among the arts on which he proposed to throw himself for though he had in so almost mystifying a manner replied to nothing denied nothing explained nothing apologised for nothing he had somehow conveyed to her that this was not because of any determination to treat her case as not worth it there had been consideration on both occasions in the way he had listened to her even though at the same time there had been extreme reserve a reserve indeed it was also to be remembered qualified by the fact that on their second and shorter interview in portland place and quite at the end of this passage she had imagined him positively proposing to her a temporary accommodation it had been but the matter of something in the depths of the eyes he finally fixed upon her and she had found in it the more she kept it before her the tacitly offered sketch of a working arrangement leave me my reserve don t question it it s all i have just now don t you see so that if you ll make me the concession of letting me alone with it for as long a time as i require i promise you something or other grown under cover of it even though i don t yet quite make out what as a return for your patience she had turned away from him with some such unspoken words as that in her ear and indeed she had to represent to herself that she had spiritually heard them had to listen to them still again to explain her particular patience in face of his particular failure he hadn t so much as pretended to meet for an instant the question raised by her of her accepted ignorance of the point in time the period before their own marriage from which his intimacy with charlotte dated as an ignorance in which he and charlotte had been personally interested and to the pitch of consummately protecting for years each other s interest as a condition so imposed upon her the fact of its having ceased might have made it on the spot the first article of his defence he had vouchsafed it however nothing better than his longest stare of postponed consideration that tribute he had coldly paid it and maggie might herself have been stupefied truly had she not had something to hold on by at her own present ability even provisional to make terms with a chapter of history into which she could but a week before not have dipped without a mortal chill at the rate at which she was living she was getting used hour by hour to these extensions of view and when she asked herself at fawns to what single observation of her own in london the prince had had an affirmation to oppose she but just failed to focus the small strained wife of the moments in question as some panting dancer of a difficult step who had capered before the footlights of an empty theatre to a spectator lounging in a box her best comprehension of amerigo s success in not committing himself was in her recall meanwhile of the inquiries he had made of her on their only return to the subject and which he had in fact explicitly provoked their return in order to make he had had it over with her again the so distinctly remarkable incident of her interview at home with the little bloomsbury shopman this anecdote for him had not altogether surprisingly required some straighter telling and the prince s attitude in presence of it had represented once more his nearest approach to a cross examination the difficulty in respect to the little man had been for the question of his motive his motive in writing first in the spirit of retraction to a lady with whom he had made a most advantageous bargain and in then coming to see her so that his apology should be personal maggie had felt her explanation weak but there were the facts and she could give no other left alone after the transaction with the knowledge that his visitor designed the object bought of him as a birthday gift to her father for maggie confessed freely to having chattered to him almost as to a friend the vendor of the golden bowl had acted on a scruple rare enough in vendors of any class and almost unprecedented in the thrifty children of israel he hadn t liked what he had done and what he had above all made such a good thing of having done at the thought of his purchaser s good faith and charming presence opposed to that flaw in her acquestion which would make it verily as an offering to a loved parent a thing of sinister meaning and evil effect he had known conscientious he had known superstitious visitings had given way to a whim all the more remarkable to his own commercial mind no doubt from its never having troubled him in other connexions she had recognised the oddity of her adventure and left it to show for what it was she had not been unconscious on the other hand that if it hadn t touched amerigo so nearly he would have found in it matter for some amused reflection he had uttered an extraordinary sound something between a laugh and a howl on her saying as she had made a point of doing oh most certainly he told me his reason was because he liked me though she remained in doubt of whether that inarticulate comment had been provoked most by the familiarities she had offered or by those that so pictured she had had to endure that the partner of her bargain had yearned to see her again that he had plainly jumped at a pretext for it this also she had frankly expressed herself to the prince as having in no snubbing no scandalised but rather in a positively appreciative and indebted spirit not delayed to make out he had wished ever so seriously to return her a part of her money and she had wholly declined to receive it and then he had uttered his hope that she had not at all events already devoted the crystal cup to the beautiful purpose she had so kindly and so fortunately named to him it wasn t a thing for a present to a person she was fond of for she wouldn t wish to give a present that would bring ill luck that had come to him so that he couldn t rest and he should feel better now that he had told her his having led her to act in ignorance was what he should have been ashamed of and if she would pardon gracious lady as she was all the liberties he had taken she might make of the bowl any use in life but that one it was after this that the most extraordinary incident of all of course had occurred his pointing to the two photographs with the remark that those were persons he knew and that more wonderful still he had made acquaintance with them years before precisely over the same article the lady on that occasion had taken up the fancy of presenting it to the gentleman and the gentleman guessing and dodging ever so cleverly had declared that he wouldn t for the world receive an object under such suspicion he himself the little man had confessed wouldn t have minded about them but he had never forgotten either their talk or their faces the impression altogether made by them and if she really wished to know now what had perhaps most moved him it was the thought that she should ignorantly have gone in for a thing not good enough for other buyers he had been immensely struck that was another point with this accident of their turning out after so long friends of hers too they had disappeared and this was the only light he had ever had upon them he had flushed up quite red with his recognition with all his responsibility had declared that the connexion must have had mysteriously something to do with the impulse he had obeyed and maggie had made to her husband while he again stood before her no secret of the shock for herself so suddenly and violently received she had done her best even while taking it full in the face not to give herself away but she wouldn t answer no she wouldn t for what she might in her agitation have made her informant think he might think what he would there had been three or four minutes during which while she asked him question upon question she had doubtless too little cared and he had spoken for his remembrance as fully as she could have wished he had spoken oh delightedly for the terms on which his other visitors had appeared to be with each other and in fact for that conviction of the nature and degree of their intimacy under which in spite of precautions they hadn t been able to help leaving him he had observed and judged and not forgotten he had been sure they were great people but no ah no distinctly hadn t liked them as he liked the signora principessa certainly she had created no vagueness about that he had been in possession of her name and address for sending her both her cup and her account but the others he had only always wondered about he had been sure they would never come back and as to the time of their visit he could place it positively to a day by reason of a transaction of importance recorded in his books that had occurred but a few hours later he had left her in short definitely rejoicing that he had been able to make up to her for not having been quite square over their little business by rendering her so unexpectedly the service of this information his joy moreover was as much as amerigo would a matter of the personal interest with which her kindness gentleness grace her charming presence and easy humanity and familiarity had inspired him all of which while in thought maggie went over it again and again oh over any imputable rashness of her own immediate passion and pain as well as over the rest of the straight little story she had after all to tell might very conceivably make a long sum for the prince to puzzle out there were meanwhile after the castledeans and those invited to meet them had gone and before mrs rance and the lutches had come three or four days during which she was to learn the full extent of her need not to be penetrable and then it was indeed that she felt all the force and threw herself upon all the help of the truth she had confided several nights earlier to fanny assingham she had known it in advance had warned herself of it while the house was full charlotte had designs upon her of a nature best known to herself and was only waiting for the better opportunity of their finding themselves less companioned this consciousness had been exactly at the bottom of maggie s wish to multiply their spectators there were moments for her positively moments of planned postponement of evasion scarcely less disguised than studied during which she turned over with anxiety the different ways there being two or three possible ones in which her young stepmother might at need seek to work upon her amerigo s not having told her of his passage with his wife gave for maggie altogether a new aspect to charlotte s consciousness and condition an aspect with which for apprehension for wonder and even at moments inconsequently enough for something like compassion the princess had now to reckon she asked herself for she was capable of that what he had meant by keeping the sharer of his guilt in the dark about a matter touching her otherwise so nearly what he had meant that is for this unmistakably mystified personage herself maggie could imagine what he had meant for her all sorts of thinkable things whether things of mere form or things of sincerity things of pity or things of prudence he had meant for instance in all probability primarily to conjure away any such appearance of a changed relation between the two women as his father in law might notice and follow up it would have been open to him however given the pitch of their intimacy to avert this danger by some more conceivable course with charlotte since an earnest warning in fact the full freedom of alarm that of his insisting to her on the peril of suspicion incurred and on the importance accordingly of outward peace at any price would have been the course really most conceivable instead of warning and advising he had reassured and deceived her so that our young woman who had been from far back by the habit if her nature as much on her guard against sacrificing others as if she felt the great trap of life mainly to be set for one s doing so now found herself attaching her fancy to that side of the situation of the exposed pair which involved for themselves at least the sacrifice of the least fortunate she never at present thought of what amerigo might be intending without the reflection by the same stroke that whatever this quantity he was leaving still more to her own ingenuity he was helping her when the thing came to the test only by the polished possibly almost too polished surface his manner to his wife wore for an admiring world and that surely was entitled to scarcely more than the praise of negative diplomacy he was keeping his manner right as she had related to mrs assingham the case would have been beyond calculation truly if on top of everything he had allowed it to go wrong she had hours of exaltation indeed when the meaning of all this pressed in upon her as a tacit vow from him to abide without question by whatever she should be able to achieve or think fit to prescribe then it was that even while holding her breath for the awe of it she truly felt almost able enough for anything it was as if she had passed in a time incredibly short from being nothing for him to being all it was as if rightly noted every turn of his head every tone of his voice in these days might mean that there was but one way in which a proud man reduced to abjection could hold himself during those of maggie s vigils in which that view loomed largest the image of her husband that it thus presented to her gave out a beauty for the revelation of which she struck herself as paying if anything all too little to make sure of it to make sure of the beauty shining out of the humility and of the humility lurking in all the pride of his presence she would have gone the length of paying more yet of paying with difficulties and anxieties compared to which those actually before her might have been as superficial as headaches or rainy days the point at which these exaltations dropped however was the point at which it was apt to come over her that if her complications had been greater the question of paying would have been limited still less to the liabilities of her own pocket the complications were verily great enough whether for ingenuities or sublimities so long as she had to come back to it so often that charlotte all the while could only be struggling with secrets sharper than her own it was odd how that certainty again and again determined and coloured her wonderments of detail the question for instance of how amerigo in snatched opportunities of conference put the haunted creature off with false explanations met her particular challenges and evaded if that was what he did do her particular demands even the conviction that charlotte was but awaiting some chance really to test her trouble upon her lover s wife left maggie s sense meanwhile open as to the sight of gilt wires and bruised wings the spacious but suspended cage the home of eternal unrest of pacings beatings shakings all so vain into which the baffled consciousness helplessly resolved itself the cage was the deluded condition and maggie as having known delusion rather understood the nature of cages she walked round charlotte s cautiously and in a very wide circle and when inevitably they had to communicate she felt herself comparatively outside on the breast of nature and saw her companion s face as that of a prisoner looking through bars so it was that through bars bars richly gilt but firmly though discreetly planted charlotte finally struck her as making a grim attempt from which at first the princess drew back as instinctively as if the door of the cage had suddenly been opened from within xxxvi they had been alone that evening alone as a party of six and four of them after dinner under suggestion not to be resisted sat down to bridge in the smoking room they had passed together to that apartment on rising from table charlotte and mrs assingham alike indulgent always to tobacco and in fact practising an emulation which as fanny said would for herself had the colonel not issued an interdict based on the fear of her stealing his cigars have stopped only at the short pipe here cards had with inevitable promptness asserted their rule the game forming itself as had often happened before of mr verver with mrs assingham for partner and of the prince with mrs verver the colonel who had then asked of maggie license to relieve his mind of a couple of letters for the earliest post out on the morrow was addressing himself to this task at the other end of the room and the princess herself had welcomed the comparatively hushed hour for the bridge players were serious and silent much in the mood of a tired actress who has the good fortune to be off while her mates are on almost long enough for a nap on the property sofa in the wing maggie s nap had she been able to snatch forty winks would have been of the spirit rather than of the sense yet as she subsided near a lamp with the last salmon coloured french periodical she was to fail for refreshment even of that sip of independence there was no question for her as she found of closing her eyes and getting away they strayed back to life in the stillness over the top of her review she could lend herself to none of those refinements of the higher criticism with which its pages bristled she was there where her companions were there again and more than ever there it was as if of a sudden they had been made in their personal intensity and their rare complexity of relation freshly importunate to her it was the first evening there had been no one else mrs rance and the lutches were due the next day but meanwhile the facts of the situation were upright for her round the green cloth and the silver flambeaux the fact of her father s wife s lover facing his mistress the fact of her father sitting all unsounded and unblinking between them the fact of charlotte keeping it up keeping up everything across the table with her husband beside her the fact of fanny assingham wonderful creature placed opposite to the three and knowing more about each probably when one came to think than either of them knew of either erect above all for her was the sharp edged fact of the relation of the whole group individually and collectively to herself herself so speciously eliminated for the hour but presumably more present to the attention of each than the next card to be played yes under that imputation to her sense they sat the imputation of wondering beneath and behind all their apparently straight play if she weren t really watching them from her corner and consciously as might be said holding them in her hand she was asking herself at last how they could bear it for though cards were as nought to her and she could follow no move so that she was always on such occasions out of the party they struck her as conforming alike in the matter of gravity and propriety to the stiff standard of the house her father she knew was a high adept one of the greatest she had been ever in her stupidity his small his sole despair amerigo excelled easily as he understood and practised every art that could beguile large leisure mrs assingham and charlotte moreover were accounted as good as members of a sex incapable of the nobler consistency could be therefore evidently they were not all so up to their usual form merely passing it off whether for her or for themselves and the amount of enjoyed or at least achieved security represented by so complete a conquest of appearances was what acted on her nerves precisely with a kind of provocative force she found herself for five minutes thrilling with the idea of the prodigious effect that just as she sat there near them she had at her command with the sense that if she were but different oh ever so different all this high decorum would hang by a hair there reigned for her absolutely during these vertiginous moments that fascination of the monstrous that temptation of the horribly possible which we so often trace by its breaking out suddenly lest it should go further in unexplained retreats and reactions after it had been thus vividly before her for a little that springing up under her wrong and making them all start stare and turn pale she might sound out their doom in a single sentence a sentence easy to choose among several of the lurid after she had faced that blinding light and felt it turn to blackness she rose from her place laying aside her magazine and moved slowly round the room passing near the card players and pausing an instant behind the chairs in turn silent and discreet she bent a vague mild face upon them as if to signify that little as she followed their doings she wished them well and she took from each across the table in the common solemnity an upward recognition which she was to carry away with her on her moving out to the terrace a few minutes later her father and her husband mrs assingham and charlotte had done nothing but meet her eyes yet the difference in these demonstrations made each a separate passage which was all the more wonderful since with the secret behind every face they had alike tried to look at her through it and in denial of it it all left her as she wandered off with the strangest of impressions the sense forced upon her as never yet of an appeal a positive confidence from the four pairs of eyes that was deeper than any negation and that seemed to speak on the part of each of some relation to be contrived by her a relation with herself which would spare the individual the danger the actual present strain of the relation with the others they thus tacitly put it upon her to be disposed of the whole complexity of their peril and she promptly saw why because she was there and there just as she was to lift it off them and take it to charge herself with it as the scapegoat of old of whom she had once seen a terrible picture had been charged with the sins of the people and had gone forth into the desert to sink under his burden and die that indeed wasn t their design and their interest that she should sink under hers it wouldn t be their feeling that she should do anything but live live on somehow for their benefit and even as much as possible in their company to keep proving to them that they had truly escaped and that she was still there to simplify this idea of her simplifying and of their combined struggle dim as yet but steadily growing toward the perception of her adopting it from them clung to her while she hovered on the terrace where the summer night was so soft that she scarce needed the light shawl she had picked up several of the long windows of the occupied rooms stood open to it and the light came out in vague shafts and fell upon the old smooth stones the hour was moonless and starless and the air heavy and still which was why in her evening dress she need fear no chill and could get away in the outer darkness from that provocation of opportunity which had assaulted her within on her sofa as a beast might have leaped at her throat nothing in fact was stranger than the way in which when she had remained there a little her companions watched by her through one of the windows actually struck her as almost consciously and gratefully safer they might have been really charming as they showed in the beautiful room and charlotte certainly as always magnificently handsome and supremely distinguished they might have been figures rehearsing some play of which she herself was the author they might even for the happy appearance they continued to present have been such figures as would by the strong note of character in each fill any author with the certitude of success especially of their own histrionic they might in short have represented any mystery they would the point being predominantly that the key to the mystery the key that could wind and unwind it without a snap of the spring was there in her pocket or rather no doubt clasped at this crisis in her hand and pressed as she walked back and forth to her breast she walked to the end and far out of the light she returned and saw the others still where she had left them she passed round the house and looked into the drawing room lighted also but empty now and seeming to speak the more in its own voice of all the possibilities she controlled spacious and splendid like a stage again awaiting a drama it was a scene she might people by the press of her spring either with serenities and dignities and decencies or with terrors and shames and ruins things as ugly as those formless fragments of her golden bowl she was trying so hard to pick up she continued to walk and continued to pause she stopped afresh for the look into the smoking room and by this time it was as if the recognition had of itself arrested her she saw as in a picture with the temptation she had fled from quite extinct why it was she had been able to give herself so little from the first to the vulgar heat of her wrong she might fairly as she watched them have missed it as a lost thing have yearned for it for the straight vindictive view the rights of resentment the rages of jealousy the protests of passion as for something she had been cheated of not least a range of feelings which for many women would have meant so much but which for her husband s wife for her father s daughter figured nothing nearer to experience than a wild eastern caravan looming into view with crude colours in the sun fierce pipes in the air high spears against the sky all a thrill a natural joy to mingle with but turning off short before it reached her and plunging into other defiles she saw at all events why horror itself had almost failed her the horror that foreshadowed in advance would by her thought have made everything that was unaccustomed in her cry out with pain the horror of finding evil seated all at its ease where she had only dreamed of good the horror of the thing hideously behind behind so much trusted so much pretended nobleness cleverness tenderness it was the first sharp falsity she had known in her life to touch at all or be touched by it had met her like some bad faced stranger surprised in one of the thick carpeted corridors of a house of quiet on a sunday afternoon and yet yes amazingly she had been able to look at terror and disgust only to know that she must put away from her the bitter sweet of their freshness the sight from the window of the group so constituted told her why told her how named to her as with hard lips named straight at her so that she must take it full in the face that other possible relation to the whole fact which alone would bear upon her irresistibly it was extraordinary they positively brought home to her that to feel about them in any of the immediate inevitable assuaging ways the ways usually open to innocence outraged and generosity betrayed would have been to give them up and that giving them up was marvellously not to be thought of she had never from the first hour of her state of acquired conviction given them up so little as now though she was no doubt as the consequence of a step taken a few minutes later to invoke the conception of doing that if might be even less she had resumed her walk stopping here and there while she rested on the cool smooth stone balustrade to draw it out in the course of which after a little she passed again the lights of the empty drawing room and paused again for what she saw and felt there it was not at once however that this became quite concrete that was the effect of her presently making out that charlotte was in the room launched and erect there in the middle and looking about her that she had evidently just come round to it from her card table by one of the passages with the expectation to all appearance of joining her stepdaughter she had pulled up at seeing the great room empty maggie not having passed out on leaving the group in a manner to be observed so definite a quest of her with the bridge party interrupted or altered for it was an impression that fairly assailed the princess and to which something of attitude and aspect of the air of arrested pursuit and purpose in charlotte together with the suggestion of her next vague movements quickly added its meaning this meaning was that she had decided that she had been infinitely conscious of maggie s presence before that she knew that she would at last find her alone and that she wanted her for some reason enough to have presumably called on bob assingham for aid he had taken her chair and let her go and the arrangement was for maggie a signal proof of her earnestness of the energy in fact that though superficially commonplace in a situation in which people weren t supposed to be watching each other was what affected our young woman on the spot as a breaking of bars the splendid shining supple creature was out of the cage was at large and the question now almost grotesquely rose of whether she mightn t by some art just where she was and before she could go further be hemmed in and secured it would have been for a moment in this case a matter of quickly closing the windows and giving the alarm with poor maggie s sense that though she couldn t know what she wanted of her it was enough for trepidation that at these firm hands anything should be to say nothing of the sequel of a flight taken again along the terrace even under the shame of the confessed feebleness of such evasions on the part of an outraged wife it was to this feebleness none the less that the outraged wife had presently resorted the most that could be said for her being as she felt while she finally stopped short at a distance that she could at any rate resist her abjection sufficiently not to sneak into the house by another way and safely reach her room she had literally caught herself in the act of dodging and ducking and it told her there vividly in a single word what she had all along been most afraid of she had been afraid of the particular passage with charlotte that would determine her father s wife to take him into her confidence as she couldn t possibly as yet have done to prepare for him a statement of her wrong to lay before him the infamy of what she was apparently suspected of this should she have made up her mind to do it would rest on a calculation the thought of which evoked strangely other possibilities and visions it would show her as sufficiently believing in her grasp of her husband to be able to assure herself that with his daughter thrown on the defensive with maggie s cause and maggie s word in fine against her own it wasn t maggie s that would most certainly carry the day such a glimpse of her conceivable idea which would be founded on reasons all her own reasons of experience and assurance impenetrable to others but intimately familiar to herself such a glimpse opened out wide as soon as it had come into view for if so much as this was still firm ground between the elder pair if the beauty of appearances had been so consistently preserved it was only the golden bowl as maggie herself knew it that had been broken the breakage stood not for any wrought discomposure among the triumphant three it stood merely for the dire deformity of her attitude toward them she was unable at the minute of course fully to measure the difference thus involved for her and it remained inevitably an agitating image the way it might be held over her that if she didn t of her own prudence satisfy charlotte as to the reference in her mocking spirit of so much of the unuttered and unutterable of the constantly and unmistakably implied her father would be invited without further ceremony to recommend her to do so but any confidence any latent operating insolence that mrs verver should thanks to her large native resources continue to be possessed of and to hold in reserve glimmered suddenly as a possible working light and seemed to offer for meeting her a new basis and something like a new system maggie felt truly a rare contraction of the heart on making out the next instant what the new system would probably have to be and she had practically done that before perceiving that the thing she feared had already taken place charlotte extending her search appeared now to define herself vaguely in the distance of this after an instant the princess was sure though the darkness was thick for the projected clearness of the smoking room windows had presently contributed its help her friend came slowly into that circle having also for herself by this time not indistinguishably discovered that maggie was on the terrace maggie from the end saw her stop before one of the windows to look at the group within and then saw her come nearer and pause again still with a considerable length of the place between them yes charlotte had seen she was watching her from afar and had stopped now to put her further attention to the test her face was fixed on her through the night she was the creature who had escaped by force from her cage yet there was in her whole motion assuredly even as so dimly discerned a kind of portentous intelligent stillness she had escaped with an intention but with an intention the more definite that it could so accord with quiet measures the two women at all events only hovered there for these first minutes face to face over their interval and exchanging no sign the intensity of their mutual look might have pierced the night and maggie was at last to start with the scared sense of having thus yielded to doubt to dread to hesitation for a time that with no other proof needed would have completely given her away how long had she stood staring a single minute or five long enough in any case to have felt herself absolutely take from her visitor something that the latter threw upon her irresistibly by this effect of silence by this effect of waiting and watching by this effect unmistakably of timing her indecision and her fear if then scared and hanging back she had as was so evident sacrificed all past pretences it would have been with the instant knowledge of an immense advantage gained that charlotte finally saw her come on maggie came on with her heart in her hands she came on with the definite prevision throbbing like the tick of a watch of a doom impossibly sharp and hard but to which after looking at it with her eyes wide open she had none the less bowed her head by the time she was at her companion s side for that matter by the time charlotte had without a motion without a word simply let her approach and stand there her head was already on the block so that the consciousness that everything had now gone blurred all perception of whether or no the axe had fallen oh the advantage it was perfectly enough in truth with mrs verver for what was maggie s own sense but that of having been thrown over on her back with her neck from the first half broken and her helpless face staring up that position only could account for the positive grimace of weakness and pain produced there by charlotte s dignity i ve come to join you i thought you would be here oh yes i m here maggie heard herself return a little flatly it s too close in doors very but close even here charlotte was still and grave she had even uttered her remark about the temperature with an expressive weight that verged upon solemnity so that maggie reduced to looking vaguely about at the sky could only feel her not fail of her purpose the air s heavy as if with thunder i think there ll be a storm she made the suggestion to carry off an awkwardness which was a part always of her companion s gain but the awkwardness didn t diminish in the silence that followed charlotte had said nothing in reply her brow was dark as with a fixed expression and her high elegance her handsome head and long straight neck testified through the dusk to their inveterate completeness and noble erectness it was as if what she had come out to do had already begun and when as a consequence maggie had said helplessly don t you want something won t you have my shawl everything might have crumbled away in the comparative poverty of the tribute mrs verver s rejection of it had the brevity of a sign that they hadn t closed in for idle words just as her dim serious face uninterruptedly presented until they moved again might have represented the success with which she watched all her message penetrate they presently went back the way she had come but she stopped maggie again within range of the smoking room window and made her stand where the party at cards would be before her side by side for three minutes they fixed this picture of quiet harmonies the positive charm of it and as might have been said the full significance which as was now brought home to maggie could be no more after all than a matter of interpretation differing always for a different interpreter as she herself had hovered in sight of it a quarter of an hour before it would have been a thing for her to show charlotte to show in righteous irony in reproach too stern for anything but silence but now it was she who was being shown it and shown it by charlotte and she saw quickly enough that as charlotte showed it so she must at present submissively seem to take it the others were absorbed and unconscious either silent over their game or dropping remarks unheard on the terrace and it was to her father s quiet face discernibly expressive of nothing that was in his daughter s mind that our young woman s attention was most directly given his wife and his daughter were both closely watching him and to which of them could he have been notified of this would his raised eyes first all impulsively have responded in which of them would he have felt it most important to destroy for his clutch at the equilibrium any germ of uneasiness not yet since his marriage had maggie so sharply and so formidably known her old possession of him as a thing divided and contested she was looking at him by charlotte s leave and under charlotte s direction quite in fact as if the particular way she should look at him were prescribed to her quite even as if she had been defied to look at him in any other it came home to her too that the challenge wasn t as might be said in his interest and for his protection but pressingly insistently in charlotte s for that of her security at any price she might verily by this dumb demonstration have been naming to maggie the price naming it as a question for maggie herself a sum of money that she properly was to find she must remain safe and maggie must pay what she was to pay with being her own affair straighter than ever thus the princess again felt it all put upon her and there was a minute just a supreme instant during which there burned in her a wild wish that her father would only look up it throbbed for these seconds as a yearning appeal to him she would chance it that is if he would but just raise his eyes and catch them across the larger space standing in the outer dark together then he might be affected by the sight taking them as they were he might make some sign she scarce knew what that would save her save her from being the one this way to pay all he might somehow show a preference distinguishing between them might out of pity for her signal to her that this extremity of her effort for him was more than he asked that represented maggie s one little lapse from consistency the sole small deflection in the whole course of her scheme it had come to nothing the next minute for the dear man s eyes had never moved and charlotte s hand promptly passed into her arm had already had very firmly drawn her on quite for that matter as from some sudden some equal perception on her part too of the more ways than one in which their impression could appeal they retraced their steps along the rest of the terrace turning the corner of the house and presently came abreast of the other windows those of the pompous drawing room still lighted and still empty here charlotte again paused and it was again as if she were pointing out what maggie had observed for herself the very look the place had of being vivid in its stillness of having with all its great objects as ordered and balanced as for a formal reception been appointed for some high transaction some real affair of state in presence of this opportunity she faced her companion once more she traced in her the effect of everything she had already communicated she signified with the same success that the terrace and the sullen night would bear too meagre witness to the completion of her idea soon enough then within the room under the old lustres of venice and the eyes of the several great portraits more or less contemporary with these that awaited on the walls of fawns their final far migration soon enough maggie found herself staring and at first all too gaspingly at the grand total to which each separate demand mrs verver had hitherto made upon her however she had made it now amounted i ve been wanting and longer than you d perhaps believe to put a question to you for which no opportunity has seemed to me yet quite so good as this it would have been easier perhaps if you had struck me as in the least disposed ever to give me one i have to take it now you see as i find it they stood in the centre of the immense room and maggie could feel that the scene of life her imagination had made of it twenty minutes before was by this time sufficiently peopled these few straight words filled it to its uttermost reaches and nothing was now absent from her consciousness either of the part she was called upon to play in it charlotte had marched straight in dragging her rich train she rose there beautiful and free with her whole aspect and action attuned to the firmness of her speech maggie had kept the shawl she had taken out with her and clutching it tight in her nervousness drew it round her as if huddling in it for shelter covering herself with it for humility she looked out as from under an improvised hood the sole headgear of some poor woman at somebody s proud door she waited even like the poor woman she met her friend s eyes with recognitions she couldn t suppress she might sound it as she could what question then everything in her from head to foot crowded it upon charlotte that she knew she knew too well that she was showing so that successful vagueness to save some scrap of her dignity from the imminence of her defeat was already a lost cause and the one thing left was if possible at any cost even that of stupid inconsequence to try to look as if she weren t afraid if she could but appear at all not afraid she might appear a little not ashamed that is not ashamed to be afraid which was the kind of shame that could be fastened on her it being fear all the while that moved her her challenge at any rate her wonder her terror the blank blurred surface whatever it was that she presented became a mixture that ceased to signify for to the accumulated advantage by which charlotte was at present sustained her next words themselves had little to add have you any ground of complaint of me is there any wrong you consider i ve done you i feel at last that i ve a right to ask you their eyes had to meet on it and to meet long maggie s avoided at least the disgrace of looking away what makes you want to ask it my natural desire to know you ve done that for so long little justice maggie waited a moment for so long you mean you ve thought i mean my dear that i ve seen i ve seen week after week that you seemed to be thinking of something that perplexed or worried you is it anything for which i m in any degree responsible maggie summoned all her powers what in the world should it be ah that s not for me to imagine and i should be very sorry to have to try to say i m aware of no point whatever at which i may have failed you said charlotte nor of any at which i may have failed any one in whom i can suppose you sufficiently interested to care if i ve been guilty of some fault i ve committed it all unconsciously and am only anxious to hear from you honestly about it but if i ve been mistaken as to what i speak of the difference more and more marked as i ve thought in all your manner to me why obviously so much the better no form of correction received from you could give me greater satisfaction she spoke it struck her companion with rising with extraordinary ease as if hearing herself say it all besides seeing the way it was listened to helped her from point to point she saw she was right that this was the tone for her to take and the thing for her to do the thing as to which she was probably feeling that she had in advance in her delays and uncertainties much exaggerated the difficulty the difficulty was small and it grew smaller as her adversary continued to shrink she was not only doing as she wanted but had by this time effectively done it and hung it up all of which but deepened maggie s sense of the sharp and simple need now of seeing her through to the end if you ve been mistaken you say and the princess but barely faltered you have been mistaken charlotte looked at her splendidly hard you re perfectly sure it s all my mistake all i can say is that you ve received a false impression ah then so much the better from the moment i had received it i knew i must sooner or later speak of it for that you see is systematically my way and now charlotte added you make me glad i ve spoken i thank you very much it was strange how for maggie too with this the difficulty seemed to sink her companion s acceptance of her denial was like a general pledge not to keep things any worse for her than they essentially had to be it positively helped her to build up her falsehood to which accordingly she contributed another block i ve affected you evidently quite accidentally in some way of which i ve been all unaware i ve not felt at any time that you ve wronged me how could i come within a mile charlotte inquired of such a possibility maggie with her eyes on her more easily now made no attempt to say she said after a little something more to the present point i accuse you i accuse you of nothing ah that s lucky charlotte had brought this out with the richness almost of gaiety and maggie to go on had to think with her own intensity of amerigo to think how he on his side had had to go through with his lie to her how it was for his wife he had done so and how his doing so had given her the clue and set her the example he must have had his own difficulty about it and she was not after all falling below him it was in fact as if thanks to her hovering image of him confronted with this admirable creature even as she was confronted there glowed upon her from afar yet straight and strong a deep explanatory light which covered the last inch of the ground he had given her something to conform to and she hadn t unintelligently turned on him gone back on him as he would have said by not conforming they were together thus he and she close close together whereas charlotte though rising there radiantly before her was really off in some darkness of space that would steep her in solitude and harass her with care the heart of the princess swelled accordingly even in her abasement she had kept in tune with the right and something certainly something that might be like a rare flower snatched from an impossible ledge would and possibly soon come of it for her the right the right yes it took this extraordinary form of her humbugging as she had called it to the end it was only a question of not by a hair s breadth deflecting into the truth so supremely was she braced you must take it from me that your anxiety rests quite on a misconception you must take it from me that i ve never at any moment fancied i could suffer by you and marvellously she kept it up not only kept it up but improved on it you must take it from me that i ve never thought of you but as beautiful wonderful and good which is all i think that you can possibly ask charlotte held her a moment longer she needed not then to have appeared only tactless the last word it s much more my dear than i dreamed of asking i only wanted your denial well then you have it upon your honour upon my honour and she made a point even our young woman of not turning away her grip of her shawl had loosened she had let it fall behind her but she stood there for anything more and till the weight should be lifted with which she saw soon enough what more was to come she saw it in charlotte s face and felt it make between them in the air a chill that completed the coldness of their conscious perjury will you kiss me on it then she couldn t say yes but she didn t say no what availed her still however was to measure in her passivity how much too far charlotte had come to retreat but there was something different also something for which while her cheek received the prodigious kiss she had her opportunity the sight of the others who having risen from their cards to join the absent members of their party had reached the open door at the end of the room and stopped short evidently in presence of the demonstration that awaited them her husband and her father were in front and charlotte s embrace of her which wasn t to be distinguished for them either she felt from her embrace of charlotte took on with their arrival a high publicity xxxvii her father had asked her three days later in an interval of calm how she was affected in the light of their reappearance and of their now perhaps richer fruition by dotty and kitty and by the once formidable mrs rance and the consequence of this inquiry had been for the pair just such another stroll together away from the rest of the party and off into the park as had asserted its need to them on the occasion of the previous visit of these anciently more agitating friends that of their long talk on a sequestered bench beneath one of the great trees when the particular question had come up for them the then purblind discussion of which at their enjoyed leisure maggie had formed the habit of regarding as the first beginning of their present situation the whirligig of time had thus brought round for them again on their finding themselves face to face while the others were gathering for tea on the terrace the same odd impulse quietly to slope so adam verver himself as they went familiarly expressed it that had acted in its way of old acted for the distant autumn afternoon and for the sharpness of their since so outlived crisis it might have been funny to them now that the presence of mrs rance and the lutches and with symptoms too at that time less developed had once for their anxiety and their prudence constituted a crisis it might have been funny that these ladies could ever have figured to their imagination as a symbol of dangers vivid enough to precipitate the need of a remedy this amount of entertainment and assistance they were indeed disposed to extract from their actual impressions they had been finding it for months past by maggie s view a resource and a relief to talk with an approach to intensity when they met of all the people they weren t really thinking of and didn t really care about the people with whom their existence had begun almost to swarm and they closed in at present round the spectres of their past as they permitted themselves to describe the three ladies with a better imitation of enjoying their theme than they had been able to achieve certainly during the stay for instance of the castledeans the castledeans were a new joke comparatively and they had had always to maggie s view to teach themselves the way of it whereas the detroit the providence party rebounding so from providence from detroit was an old and ample one of which the most could be made and as to which a humorous insistence could be guarded sharp and sudden moreover this afternoon had been their well nigh confessed desire just to rest together a little as from some strain long felt but never named to rest as who should say shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand each pair of eyes so yearningly and indeed what could it be but so wearily closed as to render the collapse safe from detection by the other pair it was positively as if in short the inward felicity of their being once more perhaps only for half an hour simply daughter and father had glimmered out for them and they had picked up the pretext that would make it easiest they were husband and wife oh so immensely as regards other persons but after they had dropped again on their old bench conscious that the party on the terrace augmented as in the past by neighbours would do beautifully without them it was wonderfully like their having got together into some boat and paddled off from the shore where husbands and wives luxuriant complications made the air too tropical in the boat they were father and daughter and poor dotty and kitty supplied abundantly for their situation the oars or the sail why into the bargain for that matter this came to maggie couldn t they always live so far as they lived together in a boat she felt in her face with the question the breath of a possibility that soothed her they needed only know each other henceforth in the unmarried relation that other sweet evening in the same place he had been as unmarried as possible which had kept down so to speak the quantity of change in their state well then that other sweet evening was what the present sweet evening would resemble with the quite calculable effect of an exquisite inward refreshment they had after all whatever happened always and ever each other each other that was the hidden treasure and the saving truth to do exactly what they would with a provision full of possibilities who could tell as yet what thanks to it they wouldn t have done before the end they had meanwhile been tracing together in the golden air that toward six o clock of a july afternoon hung about the massed kentish woods several features of the social evolution of her old playmates still beckoned on it would seem by unattainable ideals still falling back beyond the sea to their native seats for renewals of the moral financial conversational one scarce knew what to call it outfit and again and for ever reappearing like a tribe of wandering jewesses our couple had finally exhausted however the study of these annals and maggie was to take up after a drop a different matter or one at least with which the immediate connection was not at first apparent were you amused at me just now when i wondered what other people could wish to struggle for did you think me she asked with some earnestness well fatuous fatuous he seemed at a loss i mean sublime in our happiness as if looking down from a height or rather sublime in our general position that s what i mean she spoke as from the habit of her anxious conscience something that disposed her frequently to assure herself for her human commerce of the state of the books of the spirit because i don t at all want she explained to be blinded or made sniffy by any sense of a social situation her father listened to this declaration as if the precautions of her general mercy could still as they betrayed themselves have surprises for him to say nothing of a charm of delicacy and beauty he might have been wishing to see how far she could go and where she would all touchingly to him arrive but she waited a little as if made nervous precisely by feeling him depend too much on what she said they were avoiding the serious standing off anxiously from the real and they fell again and again as if to disguise their precaution itself into the tone of the time that came back to them from their other talk when they had shared together this same refuge don t you remember she went on how when they were here before i broke it to you that i wasn t so very sure we ourselves had the thing itself he did his best to do so had you mean a social situation yes after fanny assingham had first broken it to me that at the rate we were going we should never have one which was what put us on charlotte oh yes they had had it over quite often enough for him easily to remember maggie had another pause taking it from him that he now could both affirm and admit without wincing that they had been at their critical moment put on charlotte it was as if this recognition had been threshed out between them as fundamental to the honest view of their success well she continued i recall how i felt about kitty and dotty that even if we had already then been more placed or whatever you may call what we are now it still wouldn t have been an excuse for wondering why others couldn t obligingly leave me more exalted by having themselves smaller ideas for those she said were the feelings we used to have oh yes he responded philosophically i remember the feelings we used to have maggie appeared to wish to plead for them a little in tender retrospect as if they had been also respectable it was bad enough i thought to have no sympathy in your heart when you had a position but it was worse to be sublime about it as i was so afraid as i m in fact still afraid of being when it wasn t even there to support one and she put forth again the earnestness she might have been taking herself as having outlived became for it which was doubtless too often even now her danger almost sententious one must always whether or no have some imagination of the states of others of what they may feel deprived of however she added kitty and dotty couldn t imagine we were deprived of anything and now and now but she stopped as for indulgence to their wonder and envy and now they see still more that we can have got everything and kept everything and yet not be proud no we re not proud she answered after a moment i m not sure that we re quite proud enough yet she changed the next instant that subject too she could only do so however by harking back as if it had been a fascination she might have been wishing under this renewed this still more suggestive visitation to keep him with her for remounting the stream of time and dipping again for the softness of the water into the contracted basin of the past we talked about it we talked about it you don t remember so well as i you too didn t know and it was beautiful of you like kitty and dotty you too thought we had a position and were surprised when i thought we ought to have told them we weren t doing for them what they supposed in fact maggie pursued we re not doing it now we re not you see really introducing them i mean not to the people they want then what do you call the people with whom they re now having tea it made her quite spring round that s just what you asked me the other time one of the days there was somebody and i told you i didn t call anybody anything i remember that such people the people we made so welcome didn t count that fanny assingham knew they didn t she had awakened his daughter the echo and on the bench there as before he nodded his head amusedly he kept nervously shaking his foot yes they were only good enough the people who came for us i remember he said again that was the way it all happened that was the way that was the way and you asked me maggie added if i didn t think we ought to tell them tell mrs rance in particular i mean that we had been entertaining her up to then under false pretences precisely but you said she wouldn t have understood to which you replied that in that case you were like her you didn t understand no no but i remember how about our having in our benighted innocence no position you quite crushed me with your explanation well then said maggie with every appearance of delight i ll crush you again i told you that you by yourself had one there was no doubt of that you were different from me you had the same one you always had and then i asked you her father concurred why in that case you hadn t the same then indeed you did he had brought her face round to him before and this held it covering him with its kindled brightness the result of the attested truth of their being able thus in talk to live again together what i replied was that i had lost my position by my marriage that one i know how i saw it would never come back i had done something to it i didn t quite know what given it away somehow and yet not as then appeared really got my return i had been assured always by dear fanny that i could get it only i must wake up so i was trying you see to wake up trying very hard yes and to a certain extent you succeeded as also in waking me but you made much he said of your difficulty to which he added it s the only case i remember mag of you ever making anything of a difficulty she kept her eyes on him a moment that i was so happy as i was that you were so happy as you were well you admitted maggie kept it up that that was a good difficulty you confessed that our life did seem to be beautiful he thought a moment yes i may very well have confessed it for so it did seem to me but he guarded himself with his dim his easier smile what do you want to put on me now only that we used to wonder that we were wondering then if our life wasn t perhaps a little selfish this also for a time much at his leisure adam verver retrospectively fixed because fanny assingham thought so oh no she never thought she couldn t think if she would anything of that sort she only thinks people are sometimes fools maggie developed she doesn t seem to think so much about their being wrong wrong that is in the sense of being wicked she doesn t the princess further adventured quite so much mind their being wicked i see i see and yet it might have been for his daughter that he didn t so very vividly see then she only thought us fools oh no i don t say that i m speaking of our being selfish and that comes under the head of the wickedness fanny condones oh i don t say she condones a scruple in maggie raised its crest besides i m speaking of what was her father showed however after a little that he had not been reached by this discrimination his thoughts were resting for the moment where they had settled look here mag he said reflectively i ain t selfish i ll be blowed if i m selfish well maggie if he would talk of that could also pronounce then father i am oh shucks said adam verver to whom the vernacular in moments of deepest sincerity could thus come back i ll believe it he presently added when amerigo complains of you ah it s just he who s my selfishness i m selfish so to speak for him i mean she continued that he s my motive in everything well her father could from experience fancy what she meant but hasn t a girl a right to be selfish about her husband what i don t mean she observed without answering is that i m jealous of him but that s his merit it s not mine her father again seemed amused at her you could be otherwise oh how can i talk she asked of otherwise it isn t luckily for me otherwise if everything were different she further presented her thought of course everything would be and then again as if that were but half my idea is this that when you only love a little you re naturally not jealous or are only jealous also a little so that it doesn t matter but when you love in a deeper and intenser way then you are in the same proportion jealous your jealousy has intensity and no doubt ferocity when however you love in the most abysmal and unutterable way of all why then you re beyond everything and nothing can pull you down mr verver listened as if he had nothing on these high lines to oppose and that s the way you love for a minute she failed to speak but at last she answered it wasn t to talk about that i do feel however beyond everything and as a consequence of that i dare say she added with a turn to gaiety seem often not to know quite where i am the mere fine pulse of passion in it the suggestion as of a creature consciously floating and shining in a warm summer sea some element of dazzling sapphire and silver a creature cradled upon depths buoyant among dangers in which fear or folly or sinking otherwise than in play was impossible something of all this might have been making once more present to him with his discreet his half shy assent to it her probable enjoyment of a rapture that he in his day had presumably convinced no great number of persons either of his giving or of his receiving he sat awhile as if he knew himself hushed almost admonished and not for the first time yet it was an effect that might have brought before him rather what she had gained than what he had missed besides who but himself really knew what he after all hadn t or even had gained the beauty of her condition was keeping him at any rate as he might feel in sight of the sea where though his personal dips were over the whole thing could shine at him and the air and the plash and the play become for him too a sensation that couldn t be fixed upon him as missing since if it wasn t personally floating if it wasn t even sitting in the sand it could yet pass very well for breathing the bliss in a communicated irresistible way for tasting the balm it could pass further for knowing for knowing that without him nothing might have been which would have been missing least of all i guess i ve never been jealous he finally remarked and it said more to her he had occasion next to perceive than he was intending for it made her as by the pressure of a spring give him a look that seemed to tell of things she couldn t speak but she at last tried for one of them oh it s you father who are what i call beyond everything nothing can pull you down he returned the look as with the sociability of their easy communion though inevitably throwing in this time a shade of solemnity he might have been seeing things to say and others whether of a type presumptuous or not doubtless better kept back so he settled on the merely obvious well then we make a pair we re all right oh we re all right a declaration launched not only with all her discriminating emphasis but confirmed by her rising with decision and standing there as if the object of their small excursion required accordingly no further pursuit at this juncture however with the act of their crossing the bar to get as might be into port there occurred the only approach to a betrayal of their having had to beat against the wind her father kept his place and it was as if she had got over first and were pausing for her consort to follow if they were all right they were all right yet he seemed to hesitate and wait for some word beyond his eyes met her own suggestively and it was only after she had contented herself with simply smiling at him smiling ever so fixedly that he spoke for the remaining importance of it from the bench where he leaned back raising his face to her his legs thrust out a trifle wearily and his hands grasping either side of the seat they had beaten against the wind and she was still fresh they had beaten against the wind and he as at the best the more battered vessel perhaps just vaguely drooped but the effect of their silence was that she appeared to beckon him on and he might have been fairly alongside of her when at the end of another minute he found their word the only thing is that as for ever putting up again with your pretending that you re selfish at this she helped him out with it you won t take it from me i won t take it from you well of course you won t for that s your way it doesn t matter and it only proves but it doesn t matter either what it proves i m at this very moment she declared frozen stiff with selfishness he faced her awhile longer in the same way it was strangely as if by this sudden arrest by their having in their acceptance of the unsaid or at least their reference to it practically given up pretending it was as if they were in for it for something they had been ineffably avoiding but the dread of which was itself in a manner a seduction just as any confession of the dread was by so much an allusion then she seemed to see him let himself go when a person s of the nature you speak of there are always other persons to suffer but you ve just been describing to me what you d take if you had once a good chance from your husband oh i m not talking about my husband then whom are you talking about both the retort and the rejoinder had come quicker than anything previously exchanged and they were followed on maggie s part by a momentary drop but she was not to fall away and while her companion kept his eyes on her while she wondered if he weren t expecting her to name his wife then with high hypocrisy as paying for his daughter s bliss she produced something that she felt to be much better i m talking about you do you mean i ve been your victim of course you ve been my victim what have you done ever done that hasn t been for me many things more than i can tell you things you ve only to think of for yourself what do you make of all that i ve done for myself yourself she brightened out with derision what do you make of what i ve done for american city it took her but a moment to say i m not talking of you as a public character i m talking of you on your personal side well american city if personalities can do it has given me a pretty personal side what do you make he went on of what i ve done for my reputation your reputation there you ve given it up to them the awful people for less than nothing you ve given it up to them to tear to pieces to make their horrible vulgar jokes against you with ah my dear i don t care for their horrible vulgar jokes adam verver almost artlessly urged then there exactly you are she triumphed everything that touches you everything that surrounds you goes on by your splendid indifference and your incredible permission at your expense just as he had been sitting he looked at her an instant longer then he slowly rose while his hands stole into his pockets and stood there before her of course my dear you go on at my expense it has never been my idea he smiled that you should work for your living i wouldn t have liked to see it with which for a little again they remained face to face say therefore i have had the feelings of a father how have they made me a victim because i sacrifice you but to what in the world at this it hung before her that she should have had as never yet her opportunity to say and it held her for a minute as in a vise her impression of his now with his strained smile which touched her to deepest depths sounding her in his secret unrest this was the moment in the whole process of their mutual vigilance in which it decidedly most hung by a hair that their thin wall might be pierced by the lightest wrong touch it shook between them this transparency with their very breath it was an exquisite tissue but stretched on a frame and would give way the next instant if either so much as breathed too hard she held her breath for she knew by his eyes the light at the heart of which he couldn t blind that he was by his intention making sure sure whether or no her certainty was like his the intensity of his dependence on it at that moment this itself was what absolutely convinced her so that as if perched up before him on her vertiginous point and in the very glare of his observation she balanced for thirty seconds she almost rocked she might have been for the time in all her conscious person the very form of the equilibrium they were in their different ways equally trying to save and they were saving it yes they were or at least she was that was still the workable issue she could say as she felt her dizziness drop she held herself hard the thing was to be done once for all by her acting now where she stood so much was crowded into so short a space that she knew already she was keeping her head she had kept it by the warning of his eyes she shouldn t lose it again she knew how and why and if she had turned cold this was precisely what helped her he had said to himself she ll break down and name amerigo she ll say it s to him she s sacrificing me and its by what that will give me with so many other things too that my suspicion will be clinched he was watching her lips spying for the symptoms of the sound whereby these symptoms had only to fail and he would have got nothing that she didn t measure out to him as she gave it she had presently in fact so recovered herself that she seemed to know she could more easily have made him name his wife than he have made her name her husband it was there before her that if she should so much as force him just not consciously to avoid saying charlotte charlotte he would have given himself away but to be sure of this was enough for her and she saw more clearly with each lapsing instant what they were both doing he was doing what he had steadily been coming to he was practically offering himself pressing himself upon her as a sacrifice he had read his way so into her best possibility and where had she already for weeks and days past planted her feet if not on her acceptance of the offer cold indeed colder and colder she turned as she felt herself suffer this close personal vision of his attitude still not to make her weaken that was her very certitude the intensity of his pressure for if something dreadful hadn t happened there wouldn t for either of them be these dreadful things to do she had meanwhile as well the immense advantage that she could have named charlotte without exposing herself as for that matter she was the next minute showing him why i sacrifice you simply to everything and to every one i take the consequences of your marriage as perfectly natural he threw back his head a little settling with one hand his eyeglass what do you call my dear the consequences your life as your marriage has made it well hasn t it made it exactly what we wanted she just hesitated then felt herself steady oh beyond what she had dreamed exactly what i wanted yes his eyes through his straightened glasses were still on hers and he might with his intenser fixed smile have been knowing she was for herself rightly inspired what do you make then of what i wanted i don t make anything any more than of what you ve got that s exactly the point i don t put myself out to do so i never have i take from you all i can get all you ve provided for me and i leave you to make of your own side of the matter what you can there you are the rest is your own affair i don t even pretend to concern myself to concern yourself he watched her as she faintly faltered looking about her now so as not to keep always meeting his face with what may have really become of you it s as if we had agreed from the first not to go into that such an arrangement being of course charming for me you can t say you know that i haven t stuck to it he didn t say so then even with the opportunity given him of her stopping once more to catch her breath he said instead oh my dear oh oh but it made no difference know as she might what a past still so recent and yet so distant it alluded to she repeated her denial warning him off on her side from spoiling the truth of her contention i never went into anything and you see i don t i ve continued to adore you but what s that from a decent daughter to such a father what but a question of convenient arrangement our having two houses three houses instead of one you would have arranged for fifty if i had wished and my making it easy for you to see the child you don t claim i suppose that my natural course once you had set up for yourself would have been to ship you back to american city these were direct inquiries they quite rang out in the soft wooded air so that adam verver for a minute appeared to meet them with reflection she saw reflection however quickly enough show him what to do with them do you know mag what you make me wish when you talk that way and he waited again while she further got from him the sense of something that had been behind deeply in the shade coming cautiously to the front and just feeling its way before presenting itself you regularly make me wish that i had shipped back to american city when you go on as you do but he really had to hold himself to say it well when i go on why you make me quite want to ship back myself you make me quite feel as if american city would be the best place for us it made her all too finely vibrate for us for me and charlotte do you know that if we should ship it would serve you quite right with which he smiled oh he smiled and if you say much more we will ship ah then it was that the cup of her conviction full to the brim overflowed at a touch there was his idea the clearness of which for an instant almost dazzled her it was a blur of light in the midst of which she saw charlotte like some object marked by contrast in blackness saw her waver in the field of vision saw her removed transported doomed and he had named charlotte named her again and she had made him which was all she had needed more it was as if she had held a blank letter to the fire and the writing had come out still larger than she hoped the recognition of it took her some seconds but she might when she spoke have been folding up these precious lines and restoring them to her pocket well i shall be as much as ever then the cause of what you do i haven t the least doubt of your being up to that if you should think i might get anything out of it even the little pleasure she laughed of having said as you call it more let my enjoyment of this therefore at any price continue to represent for you what i call sacrificing you she had drawn a long breath she had made him do it all for her and had lighted the way to it without his naming her husband that silence had been as distinct as the sharp the inevitable sound and something now in him followed it up a sudden air as of confessing at last fully to where she was and of begging the particular question don t you think then i can take care of myself ah it s exactly what i ve gone upon if it wasn t for that but she broke off and they remained only another moment face to face i ll let you know my dear the day i feel you ve begun to sacrifice me begun she extravagantly echoed well it will be for me the day you ve ceased to believe in me with which his glasses still fixed on her his hands in his pockets his hat pushed back his legs a little apart he seemed to plant or to square himself for a kind of assurance it had occurred to him he might as well treat her to in default of other things before they changed their subject it had the effect for her of a reminder a reminder of all he was of all he had done of all above and beyond his being her perfect little father she might take him as representing take him as having quite eminently in the eyes of two hemispheres been capable of and as therefore wishing not was it illegitimately to call her attention to the successful beneficent person the beautiful bountiful original dauntlessly wilful great citizen the consummate collector and infallible high authority he had been and still was these things struck her on the spot as making up for him in a wonderful way a character she must take into account in dealing with him either for pity or for envy he positively under the impression seemed to loom larger than life for her so that she saw him during these moments in a light of recognition which had had its brightness for her at many an hour of the past but which had never been so intense and so almost admonitory his very quietness was part of it now as always part of everything of his success his originality his modesty his exquisite public perversity his inscrutable incalculable energy and this quality perhaps it might be all the more too as the result for the present occasion of an admirable traceable effort that placed him in her eyes as no precious a work of art probably had ever been placed in his own there was a long moment absolutely during which her impression rose and rose even as that of the typical charmed gazer in the still museum before the named and dated object the pride of the catalogue that time has polished and consecrated extraordinary in particular was the number of the different ways in which he thus affected her as showing he was strong that was the great thing he was sure sure for himself always whatever his idea the expression of that in him had somehow never appeared more identical with his proved taste for the rare and the true but what stood out beyond everything was that he was always marvellously young which couldn t but crown at this juncture his whole appeal to her imagination before she knew it she was lifted aloft by the consciousness that he was simply a great and deep and high little man and that to love him with tenderness was not to be distinguished a whit from loving him with pride it came to her all strangely as a sudden an immense relief the sense that he wasn t a failure and could never be purged their predicament of every meanness made it as if they had really emerged in their transmuted union to smile almost without pain it was like a new confidence and after another instant she knew even still better why wasn t it because now also on his side he was thinking of her as his daughter was trying her during these mute seconds as the child of his blood oh then if she wasn t with her little conscious passion the child of any weakness what was she but strong enough too it swelled in her fairly it raised her higher higher she wasn t in that case a failure either hadn t been but the contrary his strength was her strength her pride was his and they were decent and competent together this was all in the answer she finally made him i believe in you more than any one than any one at all she hesitated for all it might mean but there was oh a thousand times no doubt of it than any one at all she kept nothing of it back now met his eyes over it let him have the whole of it after which she went on and that s the way i think you believe in me he looked at her a minute longer but his tone at last was right about the way yes well then she spoke as for the end and for other matters for anything everything else there might be they would never return to it well then his hands came out and while her own took them he drew her to his breast and held her he held her hard and kept her long and she let herself go but it was an embrace that august and almost stern produced for all its intimacy no revulsion and broke into no inconsequence of tears xxxviii maggie was to feel after this passage how they had both been helped through it by the influence of that accident of her having been caught a few nights before in the familiar embrace of her father s wife his return to the saloon had chanced to coincide exactly with this demonstration missed moreover neither by her husband nor by the assinghams who their card party suspended had quitted the billiard room with him she had been conscious enough at the time of what such an impression received by the others might in that extended state do for her case and none the less that as no one had appeared to wish to be the first to make a remark about it it had taken on perceptibly the special shade of consecration conferred by unanimities of silence the effect she might have considered had been almost awkward the promptitude of her separation from charlotte as if they had been discovered in some absurdity on her becoming aware of spectators the spectators on the other hand that was the appearance mightn t have supposed them in the existing relation addicted to mutual endearments and yet hesitating with a fine scruple between sympathy and hilarity must have felt that almost any spoken or laughed comment could be kept from sounding vulgar only by sounding beyond any permitted measure intelligent they had evidently looked the two young wives like a pair of women making up effusively as women were supposed to do especially when approved fools after a broil but taking note of the reconciliation would imply on her father s part on amerigo s and on fanny assingham s some proportionate vision of the grounds of their difference there had been something there had been but too much in the incident for each observer yet there was nothing any one could have said without seeming essentially to say see see the dear things their quarrel s blissfully over our quarrel what quarrel the dear things themselves would necessarily in that case have demanded and the wits of the others would thus have been called upon for some agility of exercise no one had been equal to the flight of producing off hand a fictive reason for any estrangement to take that is the place of the true which had so long for the finer sensibility pervaded the air and every one accordingly not to be inconveniently challenged was pretending immediately after to have remarked nothing that any one else hadn t maggie s own measure had remained all the same full of the reflection caught from the total inference which had acted virtually by enabling every one present and oh charlotte not least to draw a long breath the message of the little scene had been different for each but it had been this markedly all round that it reinforced reinforced even immensely the general effort carried on from week to week and of late distinctly more successful to look and talk and move as if nothing in life were the matter supremely however while this glass was held up to her had maggie s sense turned to the quality of the success constituted on the spot for charlotte most of all if she was guessing how her father must have secretly started how her husband must have secretly wondered how fanny assingham must have secretly in a flash seen daylight for herself most of all had she tasted by communication of the high profit involved for her companion she felt in all her pulses charlotte feel it and how publicity had been required absolutely to crown her own abasement it was the added touch and now nothing was wanting which to do her stepmother justice mrs verver had appeared but to desire from that evening to show with the last vividness that she recognised maggie lived over again the minutes in question had found herself repeatedly doing so to the degree that the whole evening hung together to her aftersense as a thing appointed by some occult power that had dealt with her that had for instance animated the four with just the right restlessness too had decreed and directed and exactly timed it in them making their game of bridge however abysmal a face it had worn for her give way precisely to their common unavowed impulse to find out to emulate charlotte s impatience a preoccupation this latter attached detectedly to the member of the party who was roaming in her queerness and was for all their simulated blindness not roaming unnoted if mrs verver meanwhile then had struck her as determined in a certain direction by the last felicity into which that night had flowered our young woman was yet not to fail of appreciating the truth that she had not been put at ease after all with absolute permanence maggie had seen her unmistakably desire to rise to the occasion and be magnificent seen her decide that the right way for this would be to prove that the reassurance she had extorted there under the high cool lustre of the saloon a twinkle of crystal and silver had not only poured oil upon the troubled waters of their question but had fairly drenched their whole intercourse with that lubricant she had exceeded the limit of discretion in this insistence on her capacity to repay in proportion a service she acknowledged as handsome why handsome maggie would have been free to ask since if she had been veracious the service assuredly would not have been huge it would in that case have come up vividly and for each of them alike that the truth on the princess s lips presented no difficulty if the latter s mood in fact could have turned itself at all to private gaiety it might have failed to resist the diversion of seeing so clever a creature so beguiled charlotte s theory of a generous manner was manifestly to express that her stepdaughter s word wiping out as she might have said everything had restored them to the serenity of a relation without a cloud it had been in short in this light ideally conclusive so that no ghost of anything it referred to could ever walk again what was the ecstasy of that however but in itself a trifle compromising as truly within the week maggie had occasion to suspect her friend of beginning and rather abruptly to remember convinced as she was of the example already given her by her husband and in relation to which her profession of trust in his mistress had been an act of conformity exquisitely calculated her imagination yet sought in the hidden play of his influence the explanation of any change of surface any difference of expression or intention there had been through life as we know few quarters in which the princess s fancy could let itself loose but it shook off restraint when it plunged into the figured void of the detail of that relation this was a realm it could people with images again and again with fresh ones they swarmed there like the strange combinations that lurked in the woods at twilight they loomed into the definite and faded into the vague their main present sign for her being however that they were always that they were duskily agitated her earlier vision of a state of bliss made insecure by the very intensity of the bliss this had dropped from her she had ceased to see as she lost herself the pair of operatic of high wagnerian lovers she found deep within her these comparisons interlocked in their wood of enchantment a green glade as romantic as one s dream of an old german forest the picture was veiled on the contrary with the dimness of trouble behind which she felt indistinguishable the procession of forms that had lost all so pitifully their precious confidence therefore though there was in these days for her with amerigo little enough even of the imitation from day to day of unembarrassed references as she had foreseen for that matter from the first that there would be her active conception of his accessibility to their companion s own private and unextinguished right to break ground was not much less active than before so it was that her inner sense in spite of everything represented him as still pulling wires and controlling currents or rather indeed as muffling the whole possibility keeping it down and down leading his accomplice continually on to some new turn of the road as regards herself maggie had become more conscious from week to week of his ingenuities of intention to make up to her for their forfeiture in so dire a degree of any reality of frankness a privation that had left on his lips perhaps a little of the same thirst with which she fairly felt her own distorted the torment of the lost pilgrim who listens in desert sands for the possible the impossible plash of water it was just this hampered state in him none the less that she kept before her when she wished most to find grounds of dignity for the hard little passion which nothing he had done could smother there were hours enough lonely hours in which she let dignity go then there were others when clinging with her winged concentration to some deep cell of her heart she stored away her hived tenderness as if she had gathered it all from flowers he was walking ostensibly beside her but in fact given over without a break to the grey medium in which he helplessly groped a perception on her part which was a perpetual pang and which might last what it would for ever if need be but which if relieved at all must be relieved by his act alone she herself could do nothing more for it she had done the utmost possible it was meantime not the easier to bear for this aspect under which charlotte was presented as depending on him for guidance taking it from him even in doses of bitterness and yet lost with him in devious depths nothing was thus more sharply to be inferred than that he had promptly enough warned her on hearing from her of the precious assurance received from his wife that she must take care her satisfaction didn t betray something of her danger maggie had a day of still waiting after allowing him time to learn how unreservedly she had lied for him of waiting as for the light of she scarce knew what slow shining reflection of this knowledge in his personal attitude what retarded evolution she asked herself in these hours mightn t poor charlotte all unwittingly have precipitated she was thus poor charlotte again for maggie even while maggie s own head was bowed and the reason for this kept coming back to our young woman in the conception of what would secretly have passed she saw her face to face with the prince take from him the chill of his stiffest admonition with the possibilities of deeper difficulty that it represented for each she heard her ask irritated and sombre what tone in god s name since her bravery didn t suit him she was then to adopt and by way of a fantastic flight of divination she heard amerigo reply in a voice of which every fine note familiar and admirable came home to her that one must really manage such prudences a little for one s self it was positive in the princess that for this she breathed charlotte s cold air turned away from him in it with her turned with her in growing compassion this way and that hovered behind her while she felt her ask herself where then she should rest marvellous the manner in which under such imaginations maggie thus circled and lingered quite as if she were materially following her unseen counting every step she helplessly wasted noting every hindrance that brought her to a pause a few days of this accordingly had wrought a change in that apprehension of the instant beatitude of triumph of triumph magnanimous and serene with which the upshot of the night scene on the terrace had condemned our young woman to make terms she had had as we know her vision of the gilt bars bent of the door of the cage forced open from within and the creature imprisoned roaming at large a movement on the creature s part that was to have even for the short interval its impressive beauty but of which the limit and in yet another direction had loomed straight into view during her last talk under the great trees with her father it was when she saw his wife s face ruefully attached to the quarter to which in the course of their session he had so significantly addressed his own it was then that maggie could watch for its turning pale it was then she seemed to know what she had meant by thinking of her in she shadow of his most ominous reference as doomed if as i say her attention now day after day so circled and hovered it found itself arrested for certain passages during which she absolutely looked with charlotte s grave eyes what she unfailingly made out through them was the figure of a little quiet gentleman who mostly wore as he moved alone across the field of vision a straw hat a white waistcoat and a blue necktie keeping a cigar in his teeth and his hands in his pockets and who oftener than not presented a somewhat meditative back while he slowly measured the perspectives of the park and broodingly counted it might have appeared his steps there were hours of intensity for a week or two when it was for all the world as if she had guardedly tracked her stepmother in the great house from room to room and from window to window only to see her here and there and everywhere try her uneasy outlook question her issue and her fate something unmistakably had come up for her that had never come up before it represented a new complication and had begotten a new anxiety things these that she carried about with her done up in the napkin of her lover s accepted rebuke while she vainly hunted for some corner where she might put them safely down the disguised solemnity the prolonged futility of her search might have been grotesque to a more ironic eye but maggie s provision of irony which we have taken for naturally small had never been so scant as now and there were moments while she watched with her thus unseen when the mere effect of being near her was to feel her own heart in her throat was to be almost moved to saying to her hold on tight my poor dear without too much terror and it will all come out somehow even to that indeed she could reflect charlotte might have replied that it was easy to say even to that no great meaning could attach so long as the little meditative man in the straw hat kept coming into view with his indescribable air of weaving his spell weaving it off there by himself in whatever quarter of the horizon the appearances were scanned he was to be noticed as absorbed in this occupation and maggie was to become aware of two or three extraordinary occasions of receiving from him the hint that he measured the impression he produced it was not really till after their recent long talk in the park that she knew how deeply how quite exhaustively they had then communicated so that they were to remain together for the time in consequence quite in the form of a couple of sociable drinkers who sit back from the table over which they have been resting their elbows over which they have emptied to the last drop their respective charged cups the cups were still there on the table but turned upside down and nothing was left for the companions but to confirm by placid silences the fact that the wine had been good they had parted positively as if on either side primed with it primed for whatever was to be and everything between them as the month waned added its touch of truth to this similitude nothing truly was at present between them save that they were looking at each other in infinite trust it fairly wanted no more words and when they met during the deep summer days met even without witnesses when they kissed at morning and evening or on any of the other occasions of contact that they had always so freely celebrated a pair of birds of the upper air could scarce have appeared less to invite each other to sit down and worry afresh so it was that in the house itself where more of his waiting treasures than ever were provisionally ranged she sometimes only looked at him from end to end of the great gallery the pride of the house for instance as if in one of the halls of a museum she had been an earnest young woman with a baedeker and he a vague gentleman to whom even baedekers were unknown he had ever of course had his way of walking about to review his possessions and verify their condition but this was a pastime to which he now struck her as almost extravagantly addicted and when she passed near him and he turned to give her a smile she caught or so she fancied the greater depth of his small perpetual hum of contemplation it was as if he were singing to himself sotto voce as he went and it was also on occasion quite ineffably as if charlotte hovering watching listening on her side too kept sufficiently within earshot to make it out as song and yet for some reason connected with the very manner of it stood off and didn t dare one of the attentions she had from immediately after her marriage most freely paid him was that of her interest in his rarities her appreciation of his taste her native passion for beautiful objects and her grateful desire not to miss anything he could teach her about them maggie had in due course seen her begin to work this fortunately natural source of sympathy for all it was worth she took possession of the mound throughout its extent she abounded to odd excess one might have remarked in the assumption of its being for her with her husband all the ground the finest clearest air and most breathable medium common to them it had been given to maggie to wonder if she didn t in these intensities of approbation too much shut him up to his province but this was a complaint he had never made his daughter and charlotte must at least have had for her that thanks to her admirable instinct her range of perception marching with his own and never falling behind she had probably not so much as once treated him to a rasping mistake or a revealing stupidity maggie wonderfully in the summer days felt it forced upon her that that was one way after all of being a genial wife and it was never so much forced upon her as at these odd moments of her encountering the sposi as amerigo called them under the coved ceilings of fawns while so together yet at the same time so separate they were making their daily round charlotte hung behind with emphasised attention she stopped when her husband stopped but at the distance of a case or two or of whatever other succession of objects and the likeness of their connection would not have been wrongly figured if he had been thought of as holding in one of his pocketed hands the end of a long silken halter looped round her beautiful neck he didn t twitch it yet it was there he didn t drag her but she came and those indications that i have described the princess as finding extraordinary in him were two or three mute facial intimations which his wife s presence didn t prevent his addressing his daughter nor prevent his daughter as she passed it was doubtless to be added from flushing a little at the receipt of they amounted perhaps only to a wordless wordless smile but the smile was the soft shake of the twisted silken rope and maggie s translation of it held in her breast till she got well away came out only as if it might have been overheard when some door was closed behind her yes you see i lead her now by the neck i lead her to her doom and she doesn t so much as know what it is though she has a fear in her heart which if you had the chances to apply your ear there that i as a husband have you would hear thump and thump and thump she thinks it may be her doom the awful place over there awful for her but she s afraid to ask don t you see just as she s afraid of not asking just as she s afraid of so many other things that she sees multiplied round her now as portents and betrayals she ll know however when she does know charlotte s one opportunity meanwhile for the air of confidence she had formerly worn so well and that agreed so with her firm and charming type was the presence of visitors never as the season advanced wholly intermitted rather in fact so constant with all the people who turned up for luncheon and for tea and to see the house now replete now famous that maggie grew to think again of this large element of company as of a kind of renewed water supply for the tank in which like a party of panting gold fish they kept afloat it helped them unmistakably with each other weakening the emphasis of so many of the silences of which their intimate intercourse would otherwise have consisted beautiful and wonderful for her even at times was the effect of these interventions their effect above all in bringing home to each the possible heroism of perfunctory things they learned fairly to live in the perfunctory they remained in it as many hours of the day as might be it took on finally the likeness of some spacious central chamber in a haunted house a great overarched and overglazed rotunda where gaiety might reign but the doors of which opened into sinister circular passages here they turned up for each other as they said with the blank faces that denied any uneasiness felt in the approach here they closed numerous doors carefully behind them all save the door that connected the place as by a straight tented corridor with the outer world and encouraging thus the irruption of society imitated the aperture through which the bedizened performers of the circus are poured into the ring the great part mrs verver had socially played came luckily maggie could make out to her assistance she had personal friends charlotte s personal friends had ever been in london at the two houses one of the most convenient pleasantries who actually tempered at this crisis her aspect of isolation and it wouldn t have been hard to guess that her best moments were those in which she suffered no fear of becoming a bore to restrain her appeal to their curiosity their curiosity might be vague but their clever hostess was distinct and she marched them about sparing them nothing as if she counted each day on a harvest of half crowns maggie met her again in the gallery at the oddest hours with the party she was entertaining heard her draw out the lesson insist upon the interest snub even the particular presumption and smile for the general bewilderment inevitable features these latter of almost any occasion in a manner that made our young woman herself incurably dazzled marvel afresh at the mystery by which a creature who could be in some connexions so earnestly right could be in others so perversely wrong when her father vaguely circulating was attended by his wife it was always charlotte who seemed to bring up the rear but he hung in the background when she did cicerone and it was then perhaps that moving mildly and modestly to and fro on the skirts of the exhibition his appearance of weaving his spell was for the initiated conscience least to be resisted brilliant women turned to him in vague emotion but his response scarce committed him more than if he had been the person employed to see that after the invading wave was spent the cabinets were all locked and the symmetries all restored there was a morning when during the hour before luncheon and shortly after the arrival of a neighbourly contingent neighbourly from ten miles off whom mrs verver had taken in charge maggie paused on the threshold of the gallery through which she had been about to pass faltered there for the very impression of his face as it met her from an opposite door charlotte half way down the vista held together as if by something almost austere in the grace of her authority the semi scared now that they were there knot of her visitors who since they had announced themselves by telegram as yearning to inquire and admire saw themselves restricted to this consistency her voice high and clear and a little hard reached her husband and her step daughter while she thus placed beyond doubt her cheerful submission to duty her words addressed to the largest publicity rang for some minutes through the place every one as quiet to listen as if it had been a church ablaze with tapers and she were taking her part in some hymn of praise fanny assingham looked rapt in devotion fanny assingham who forsook this other friend as little as she forsook either her host or the princess or the prince or the principino she supported her in slow revolutions in murmurous attestations of presence at all such times and maggie advancing after a first hesitation was not to fail of noting her solemn inscrutable attitude her eyes attentively lifted so that she might escape being provoked to betray an impression she betrayed one however as maggie approached dropping her gaze to the latter s level long enough to seem to adventure marvellously on a mute appeal you understand don t you that if she didn t do this there would be no knowing what she might do this light mrs assingham richly launched while her younger friend unresistingly moved became uncertain again and then not too much to show it or rather positively to conceal it and to conceal something more as well turned short round to one of the windows and awkwardly pointlessly waited the largest of the three pieces has the rare peculiarity that the garlands looped round it which as you see are the finest possible vieux saxe are not of the same origin or period or even wonderful as they are of a taste quite so perfect they have been put on at a later time by a process of which there are very few examples and none so important as this which is really quite unique so that though the whole thing is a little baroque its value as a specimen is i believe almost inestimable so the high voice quavered aiming truly at effects far over the heads of gaping neighbours so the speaker piling it up sticking at nothing as less interested judges might have said seemed to justify the faith with which she was honoured maggie meanwhile at the window knew the strangest thing to be happening she had turned suddenly to crying or was at least on the point of it the lighted square before her all blurred and dim the high voice went on its quaver was doubtless for conscious ears only but there were verily thirty seconds during which it sounded for our young woman like the shriek of a soul in pain kept up a minute longer it would break and collapse so that maggie felt herself the next thing turn with a start to her father can t she be stopped hasn t she done it enough some such question as that she let herself ask him to suppose in her then it was that across half the gallery for he had not moved from where she had first seen him he struck her as confessing with strange tears in his own eyes to sharp identity of emotion poor thing poor thing it reached straight isn t she for one s credit on the swagger after which as held thus together they had still another strained minute the shame the pity the better knowledge the smothered protest the divined anguish even so overcame him that blushing to his eyes he turned short away the affair but of a few muffled moments this snatched communion yet lifted maggie as on air so much for deep guesses on her own side too it gave her to think of there was honestly an awful mixture in things and it was not closed to her aftersense of such passages we have already indeed in other cases seen it open that the deepest depth of all in a perceived penalty was that you couldn t be sure some of your compunctions and contortions wouldn t show for ridiculous amerigo that morning for instance had been as absent as he at this juncture appeared to desire he should mainly be noted as being he had gone to london for the day and the night a necessity that now frequently rose for him and that he had more than once suffered to operate during the presence of guests successions of pretty women the theory of his fond interest in whom had been publicly cultivated it had never occurred to his wife to pronounce him ingenuous but there came at last a high dim august dawn when she couldn t sleep and when creeping restlessly about and breathing at her window the coolness of wooded acres she found the faint flush of the east march with the perception of that other almost equal prodigy it rosily coloured her vision that even such as he was yes her husband could on occasion sin by excess of candour he wouldn t otherwise have given as his reason for going up to portland place in the august days that he was arranging books there he had bought a great many of late and he had had others a large number sent from rome wonders of old print in which her father had been interested but when her imagination tracked him to the dusty town to the house where drawn blinds and pale shrouds where a caretaker and a kitchenmaid were alone in possession it wasn t to see him in his shirtsleeves unpacking battered boxes she saw him in truth less easily beguiled saw him wander in the closed dusky rooms from place to place or else for long periods recline on deep sofas and stare before him through the smoke of ceaseless cigarettes she made him out as liking better than anything in the world just now to be alone with his thoughts being herself connected with his thoughts she continued to believe more than she had ever been it was thereby a good deal as if he were alone with her she made him out as resting so from that constant strain of the perfunctory to which he was exposed at fawns and she was accessible to the impression of the almost beggared aspect of this alternative it was like his doing penance in sordid ways being sent to prison or being kept without money it wouldn t have taken much to make her think of him as really kept without food he might have broken away might easily have started to travel he had a right thought wonderful maggie now to so many more freedoms than he took his secret was of course that at fawns he all the while winced was all the while in presences in respect to which he had thrown himself back with a hard pressure on whatever mysteries of pride whatever inward springs familiar to the man of the world he could keep from snapping maggie for some reason had that morning while she watched the sunrise taken an extraordinary measure of the ground on which he would have had to snatch at pretexts for absence it all came to her there he got off to escape from a sound the sound was in her own ears still that of charlotte s high coerced quaver before the cabinets in the hushed gallery the voice by which she herself had been pierced the day before as by that of a creature in anguish and by which while she sought refuge at the blurred window the tears had been forced into her eyes her comprehension soared so high that the wonder for her became really his not feeling the need of wider intervals and thicker walls before that admiration she also meditated consider as she might now she kept reading not less into what he omitted than into what he performed a beauty of intention that touched her fairly the more by being obscure it was like hanging over a garden in the dark nothing was to be made of the confusion of growing things but one felt they were folded flowers and their vague sweetness made the whole air their medium he had to turn away but he wasn t at least a coward he would wait on the spot for the issue of what he had done on the spot she sank to her knees with her arm on the ledge of her window seat where she blinded her eyes from the full glare of seeing that his idea could only be to wait whatever might come at her side it was to her buried face that she thus for a long time felt him draw nearest though after a while when the strange wail of the gallery began to repeat its inevitable echo she was conscious of how that brought out his pale hard grimace xxxix the resemblance had not been present to her on first coming out into the hot still brightness of the sunday afternoon only the second sunday of all the summer when the party of six the party of seven including the principino had practically been without accessions or invasions but within sight of charlotte seated far away very much where she had expected to find her the princess fell to wondering if her friend wouldn t be affected quite as she herself had been that night on the terrace under mrs verver s perceptive pursuit the relation to day had turned itself round charlotte was seeing her come through patches of lingering noon quite as she had watched charlotte menace her through the starless dark and there was a moment that of her waiting a little as they thus met across the distance when the interval was bridged by a recognition not less soundless and to all appearance not less charged with strange meanings than that of the other occasion the point however was that they had changed places maggie had from her window seen her stepmother leave the house at so unlikely an hour three o clock of a canicular august for a ramble in garden or grove and had thereupon felt her impulse determined with the same sharpness that had made the spring of her companion s three weeks before it was the hottest day of the season and the shaded siesta for people all at their ease would certainly rather have been prescribed but our young woman had perhaps not yet felt it so fully brought home that such refinements of repose among them constituted the empty chair at the feast this was the more distinct as the feast literally in the great bedimmed dining room the cool ceremonious semblance of luncheon had just been taking place without mrs verver she had been represented but by the plea of a bad headache not reported to the rest of the company by her husband but offered directly to mr verver himself on their having assembled by her maid deputed for the effect and solemnly producing it maggie had sat down with the others to viands artfully iced to the slow circulation of precious tinkling jugs to marked reserves of reference in many directions poor fanny assingham herself scarce thrusting her nose out of the padded hollow into which she had withdrawn a consensus of languor which might almost have been taken for a community of dread ruled the scene relieved only by the fitful experiments of father mitchell good holy hungry man a trusted and overworked london friend and adviser who had taken for a week or two the light neighbouring service local rites flourishing under maggie s munificence and was enjoying as a convenience all the bounties of the house he conversed undiscouraged father mitchell conversed mainly with the indefinite wandering smile of the entertainers and the princess s power to feel him on the whole a blessing for these occasions was not impaired by what was awkward in her consciousness of having from the first of her trouble really found her way without his guidance she asked herself at times if he suspected how more than subtly how perversely she had dispensed with him and she balanced between visions of all he must privately have guessed and certitudes that he had guessed nothing whatever he might nevertheless have been so urbanely filling up gaps at present for the very reason that his instinct sharper than the expression of his face had sufficiently served him made him aware of the thin ice figuratively speaking and of prolongations of tension round about him mostly foreign to the circles in which luxury was akin to virtue some day in some happier season she would confess to him that she hadn t confessed though taking so much on her conscience but just now she was carrying in her weak stiffened hand a glass filled to the brim as to which she had recorded a vow that no drop should overflow she feared the very breath of a better wisdom the jostle of the higher light of heavenly help itself and in addition however that might be she drew breath this afternoon as never yet in an element heavy to oppression something grave had happened somehow and somewhere and she had god knew her choice of suppositions her heart stood still when she wondered above all if the cord mightn t at last have snapped between her husband and her father she shut her eyes for dismay at the possibility of such a passage there moved before them the procession of ugly forms it might have taken find out for yourself she had thrown to amerigo for her last word on the question of who else knew that night of the breaking of the bowl and she flattered herself that she hadn t since then helped him in her clear consistency by an inch it was what she had given him all these weeks to be busy with and she had again and again lain awake for the obsession of this sense of his uncertainty ruthlessly and endlessly playing with his dignity she had handed him over to an ignorance that couldn t even try to become indifferent and that yet wouldn t project itself either into the cleared air of conviction in proportion as he was generous it had bitten into his spirit and more than once she had said to herself that to break the spell she had cast upon him and that the polished old ivory of her father s inattackable surface made so absolute he would suddenly commit some mistake or some violence smash some windowpane for air fail even of one of his blest inveteracies of taste in that way fatally he would have put himself in the wrong blighting by a single false step the perfection of his outward show these shadows rose and fell for her while father mitchell prattled with other shadows as well those that hung over charlotte herself those that marked her as a prey to equal suspicions to the idea in particular of a change such a change as she didn t dare to face in the relations of the two men or there were yet other possibilities as it seemed to maggie there were always too many and all of them things of evil when one s nerves had at last done for one all that nerves could do had left one in a darkness of prowling dangers that was like the predicament of the night watcher in a beast haunted land who has no more means for a fire she might with such nerves have supposed almost anything of any one anything almost of poor bob assingham condemned to eternal observances and solemnly appreciating her father s wine anything verily yes of the good priest as he finally sat back with fat folded hands and twiddled his thumbs on his stomach the good priest looked hard at the decanters at the different dishes of dessert he eyed them half obliquely as if they might have met him to day for conversation better than any one present but the princess had her fancy at last about that too she was in the midst of a passage before she knew it between father mitchell and charlotte some approach he would have attempted with her that very morning perhaps to the circumstance of an apparent detachment recently noted in her from any practice of devotion he would have drawn from this say his artless inference taken it for a sign of some smothered inward trouble and pointed naturally the moral that the way out of such straits was not through neglect of the grand remedy he had possibly prescribed contrition he had at any rate quickened in her the beat of that false repose to which our young woman s own act had devoted her at her all so deluded instance the falsity of it had laid traps compared to which the imputation of treachery even accepted might have seemed a path of roses the acceptance strangely would have left her nothing to do she could have remained had she liked all insolently passive whereas the failure to proceed against her as it might have been called left her everything and all the more that it was wrapped so in confidence she had to confirm day after day the rightness of her cause and the justice and felicity of her exemption so that wouldn t there have been fairly in any explicit concern of father mitchell s depths of practical derision of her success the question was provisionally answered at all events by the time the party at luncheon had begun to disperse with maggie s version of mrs verver sharp to the point of representing her pretext for absence as a positive flight from derision she met the good priest s eyes before they separated and priests were really at the worst so to speak such wonderful people that she believed him for an instant on the verge of saying to her in abysmal softness go to mrs verver my child you go you ll find that you can help her this didn t come however nothing came but the renewed twiddle of thumbs over the satisfied stomach and the full flush the comical candour of reference to the hand employed at fawns for mayonnaise of salmon nothing came but the receding backs of each of the others her father s slightly bent shoulders in especial which seemed to weave his spell by the force of habit not less patiently than if his wife had been present her husband indeed was present to feel anything there might be to feel which was perhaps exactly why this personage was moved promptly to emulate so definite an example of sloping he had his occupations books to arrange perhaps even at fawns the idea of the siesta moreover in all the conditions had no need to be loudly invoked maggie was in the event left alone for a minute with mrs assingham who after waiting for safety appeared to have at heart to make a demonstration the stage of talking over had long passed for them when they communicated now it was on quite ultimate facts but fanny desired to testify to the existence on her part of an attention that nothing escaped she was like the kind lady who happening to linger at the circus while the rest of the spectators pour grossly through the exits falls in with the overworked little trapezist girl the acrobatic support presumably of embarrassed and exacting parents and gives her as an obscure and meritorious artist assurance of benevolent interest what was clearest always in our young woman s imaginings was the sense of being herself left for any occasion in the breach she was essentially there to bear the burden in the last resort of surrounding omissions and evasions and it was eminently to that office she had been to day abandoned with this one alleviation as appeared of mrs assingham s keeping up with her mrs assingham suggested that she too was still on the ramparts though her gallantry proved indeed after a moment to consist not a little of her curiosity she had looked about and seen their companions beyond earshot don t you really want us to go maggie found a faint smile do you really want to it made her friend colour well then no but we would you know at a look from you we d pack up and be off as a sacrifice ah make no sacrifice said maggie see me through that s it that s all i want i should be too base besides fanny went on you re too splendid splendid splendid also you know you are all but through you ve done it said mrs assingham but maggie only half took it from her what does it strike you that i ve done what you wanted they re going maggie continued to look at her is that what i wanted oh it wasn t for you to say that was his business my father s maggie asked after an hesitation your father s he has chosen and now she knows she sees it all before her and she can t speak or resist or move a little finger that s what s the matter with her said fanny assingham it made a picture somehow for the princess as they stood there the picture that the words of others whatever they might be always made for her even when her vision was already charged better than any words of her own she saw round about her through the chinks of the shutters the hard glare of nature saw charlotte somewhere in it virtually at bay and yet denied the last grace of any protecting truth she saw her off somewhere all unaided pale in her silence and taking in her fate has she told you she then asked her companion smiled superior i don t need to be told either i see something thank god every day and then as maggie might appear to be wondering what for instance i see the long miles of ocean and the dreadful great country state after state which have never seemed to me so big or so terrible i see them at last day by day and step by step at the far end and i see them never come back but never simply i see the extraordinary interesting place which i ve never been to you know and you have and the exact degree in which she will be expected to be interested she will be maggie presently replied expected interested for a little after this their eyes met on it at the end of which fanny said she ll be yes what she ll have to be and it will be won t it for ever and ever she spoke as abounding in her friend s sense but it made maggie still only look at her these were large words and large visions all the more that now really they spread and spread in the midst of them however mrs assingham had soon enough continued when i talk of knowing indeed i don t mean it as you would have a right to do you know because you see and i don t see him i don t make him out she almost crudely confessed maggie again hesitated you mean you don t make out amerigo but fanny shook her head and it was quite as if as an appeal to one s intelligence the making out of amerigo had in spite of everything long been superseded then maggie measured the reach of her allusion and how what she next said gave her meaning a richness no other name was to be spoken and mrs assingham had taken that without delay from her eyes with a discretion still that fell short but by an inch you know how he feels maggie at this then slowly matched her headshake i know nothing you know how you feel but again she denied it i know nothing if i did well if you did fanny asked as she faltered she had had enough however i should die she said as she turned away she went to her room through the quiet house she roamed there a moment picking up pointlessly a different fan and then took her way to the shaded apartments in which at this hour the principino would be enjoying his nap she passed through the first empty room the day nursery and paused at an open door the inner room large dim and cool was equally calm her boy s ample antique historical royal crib consecrated reputedly by the guarded rest of heirs apparent and a gift early in his career from his grandfather ruled the scene from the centre in the stillness of which she could almost hear the child s soft breathing the prime protector of his dreams was installed beside him her father sat there with as little motion with head thrown back and supported with eyes apparently closed with the fine foot that was so apt to betray nervousness at peace upon the other knee with the unfathomable heart folded in the constant flawless freshness of the white waistcoat that could always receive in its armholes the firm prehensile thumbs mrs noble had majestically melted and the whole place signed her temporary abdication yet the actual situation was regular and maggie lingered but to look she looked over her fan the top of which was pressed against her face long enough to wonder if her father really slept or if aware of her he only kept consciously quiet did his eyes truly fix her between lids partly open and was she to take this his forebearance from any question only as a sign again that everything was left to her she at all events for a minute watched his immobility then as if once more renewing her total submission returned without a sound to her own quarters a strange impulse was sharp in her but it was not for her part the desire to shift the weight she could as little have slept as she could have slept that morning days before when she had watched the first dawn from her window turned to the east this side of her room was now in shade with the two wings of the casement folded back and the charm she always found in her seemingly perched position as if her outlook from above the high terraces was that of some castle tower mounted on a rock when she stood there she hung over over the gardens and the woods all of which drowsed below her at this hour in the immensity of light the miles of shade looked hot the banks of flowers looked dim the peacocks on the balustrades let their tails hang limp and the smaller birds lurked among the leaves nothing therefore would have appeared to stir in the brilliant void if maggie at the moment she was about to turn away had not caught sight of a moving spot a clear green sunshade in the act of descending a flight of steps it passed down from the terrace receding at a distance from sight and carried naturally so as to conceal the head and back of its bearer but maggie had quickly recognised the white dress and the particular motion of this adventurer had taken in that charlotte of all people had chosen the glare of noon for an exploration of the gardens and that she could be betaking herself only to some unvisited quarter deep in them or beyond them that she had already marked as a superior refuge the princess kept her for a few minutes in sight watched her long enough to feel her by the mere betrayal of her pace and direction driven in a kind of flight and then understood for herself why the act of sitting still had become impossible to either of them there came to her confusedly some echo of an ancient fable some vision of io goaded by the gadfly or of ariadne roaming the lone sea strand it brought with it all the sense of her own intention and desire she too might have been for the hour some far off harassed heroine only with a part to play for which she knew exactly no inspiring precedent she knew but that all the while all the while of her sitting there among the others without her she had wanted to go straight to this detached member of the party and make somehow for her support the last demonstration a pretext was all that was needful and maggie after another instant had found one she had caught a glimpse before mrs verver disappeared of her carrying a book made out half lost in the folds of her white dress the dark cover of a volume that was to explain her purpose in case of her being met with surprise and the mate of which precisely now lay on maggie s table the book was an old novel that the princess had a couple of days before mentioned having brought down from portland place in the charming original form of its three volumes charlotte had hailed with a specious glitter of interest the opportunity to read it and our young woman had thereupon on the morrow directed her maid to carry it to mrs verver s apartments she was afterwards to observe that this messenger unintelligent or inadvertent had removed but one of the volumes which happened not to be the first still possessed accordingly of the first while charlotte going out fantastically at such an hour to cultivate romance in an arbour was helplessly armed with the second maggie prepared on the spot to sally forth with succour the right volume with a parasol was all she required in addition that is to the bravery of her general idea she passed again through the house unchallenged and emerged upon the terrace which she followed hugging the shade with that consciousness of turning the tables on her friend which we have already noted but so far as she went after descending into the open and beginning to explore the grounds mrs verver had gone still further with the increase of the oddity moreover of her having exchanged the protection of her room for these exposed and shining spaces it was not fortunately however at last that by persisting in pursuit one didn t arrive at regions of admirable shade this was the asylum presumably that the poor wandering woman had had in view several wide alleys in particular of great length densely overarched with the climbing rose and the honeysuckle and converging in separate green vistas at a sort of umbrageous temple an ancient rotunda pillared and statued niched and roofed yet with its uncorrected antiquity like that of everything else at fawns conscious hitherto of no violence from the present and no menace from the future charlotte had paused there in her frenzy or what ever it was to be called the place was a conceivable retreat and she was staring before her from the seat to which she appeared to have sunk all unwittingly as maggie stopped at the beginning of one of the perspectives it was a repetition more than ever then of the evening on the terrace the distance was too great to assure her she had been immediately seen but the princess waited with her intention as charlotte on the other occasion had waited allowing oh allowing for the difference of the intention maggie was full of the sense of that so full that it made her impatient whereupon she moved forward a little placing herself in range of the eyes that had been looking off elsewhere but that she had suddenly called to recognition charlotte had evidently not dreamed of being followed and instinctively with her pale stare she stiffened herself for protest maggie could make that out as well as further however that her second impression of her friend s approach had an instant effect on her attitude the princess came nearer gravely and in silence but fairly paused again to give her time for whatever she would whatever she would whatever she could was what maggie wanted wanting above all to make it as easy for her as the case permitted that was not what charlotte had wanted the other night but this never mattered the great thing was to allow her was fairly to produce in her the sense of highly choosing at first clearly she had been frightened she had not been pursued it had quickly struck her without some design on the part of her pursuer and what might she not be thinking of in addition but the way she had when herself the pursuer made her stepdaughter take in her spirit and her purpose it had sunk into maggie at the time that hard insistence and mrs verver had felt it and seen it and heard it sink which wonderful remembrance of pressure successfully applied had naturally till now remained with her but her stare was like a projected fear that the buried treasure so dishonestly come by for which her companion s still countenance at the hour and afterwards had consented to serve as the deep soil might have worked up again to the surface to be thrown back upon her hands yes it was positive that during one of these minutes the princess had the vision of her particular alarm it s her lie it s her lie that has mortally disagreed with her she can keep down no longer her rebellion at it and she has come to retract it to disown it and denounce it to give me full in my face the truth instead this for a concentrated instant maggie felt her helplessly gasp but only to let it bring home the indignity the pity of her state she herself could but tentatively hover place in view the book she carried look as little dangerous look as abjectly mild as possible remind herself really of people she had read about in stories of the wild west people who threw up their hands on certain occasions as a sign they weren t carrying revolvers she could almost have smiled at last troubled as she yet knew herself to show how richly she was harmless she held up her volume which was so weak a weapon and while she continued for consideration to keep her distance she explained with as quenched a quaver as possible i saw you come out saw you from my window and couldn t bear to think you should find yourself here without the beginning of your book this is the beginning you ve got the wrong volume and i ve brought you out the right she remained after she had spoken it was like holding a parley with a possible adversary and her intense her exalted little smile asked for formal leave may i come nearer now she seemed to say as to which however the next minute she saw charlotte s reply lose itself in a strange process a thing of several sharp stages which she could stand there and trace the dread after a minute had dropped from her face though discernibly enough she still couldn t believe in her having in so strange a fashion been deliberately made up to if she had been made up to at least it was with an idea the idea that had struck her at first as necessarily dangerous that it wasn t insistently wasn t this shone from maggie with a force finally not to be resisted and on that perception on the immense relief so constituted everything had by the end of three minutes extraordinarily changed maggie had come out to her really because she knew her doomed doomed to a separation that was like a knife in her heart and in the very sight of her uncontrollable her blinded physical quest of a peace not to be grasped something of mrs assingham s picture of her as thrown for a grim future beyond the great sea and the great continent had at first found fulfilment she had got away in this fashion burning behind her almost the ships of disguise to let her horror of what was before her play up without witnesses and even after maggie s approach had presented an innocent front it was still not to be mistaken that she bristled with the signs of her extremity it was not to be said for them either that they were draped at this hour in any of her usual graces unveiled and all but unashamed they were tragic to the princess in spite of the dissimulation that with the return of comparative confidence was so promptly to operate how tragic in essence the very change made vivid the instant stiffening of the spring of pride this for possible defence if not for possible aggression pride indeed the next moment had become the mantle caught up for protection and perversity she flung it round her as a denial of any loss of her freedom to be doomed was in her situation to have extravagantly incurred a doom so that to confess to wretchedness was by the same stroke to confess to falsity she wouldn t confess she didn t a thousand times no she only cast about her and quite frankly and fiercely for something else that would give colour to her having burst her bonds her eyes expanded her bosom heaved as she invoked it and the effect upon maggie was verily to wish she could only help her to it she presently got up which seemed to mean oh stay if you like and when she had moved about awhile at random looking away looking at anything at everything but her visitor when she had spoken of the temperature and declared that she revelled in it when she had uttered her thanks for the book which a little incoherently with her second volume she perhaps found less clever than she expected when she had let maggie approach sufficiently closer to lay untouched the tribute in question on a bench and take up obligingly its superfluous mate when she had done these things she sat down in another place more or less visibly in possession of her part our young woman was to have passed in all her adventure no stranger moments for she not only now saw her companion fairly agree to take her then for the poor little person she was finding it so easy to appear but fell in a secret responsive ecstasy to wondering if there were not some supreme abjection with which she might be inspired vague but increasingly brighter this possibility glimmered on her it at last hung there adequately plain to charlotte that she had presented herself once more to as they said grovel and that truly made the stage large it had absolutely within the time taken on the dazzling merit of being large for each of them alike i m glad to see you alone there s something i ve been wanting to say to you i m tired said mrs verver i m tired tired it had dropped the next thing it couldn t all come at once but maggie had already guessed what it was and the flush of recognition was in her face tired of this life the one we ve been leading you like it i know but i ve dreamed another dream she held up her head now her lighted eyes more triumphantly rested she was finding she was following her way maggie by the same influence sat in sight of it there was something she was saving some quantity of which she herself was judge and it was for a long moment even with the sacrifice the princess had come to make a good deal like watching her from the solid shore plunge into uncertain into possibly treacherous depths i see something else she went on i ve an idea that greatly appeals to me i ve had it for a long time it has come over me that we re wrong our real life isn t here maggie held her breath ours my husband s and mine i m not speaking for you oh said maggie only praying not to be not even to appear stupid i m speaking for ourselves i m speaking charlotte brought out for him i see for my father for your father for whom else they looked at each other hard now but maggie s face took refuge in the intensity of her interest she was not at all even so stupid as to treat her companion s question as requiring an answer a discretion that her controlled stillness had after an instant justified i must risk your thinking me selfish for of course you know what it involves let me admit it i am selfish i place my husband first well said maggie smiling and smiling since that s where i place mine you mean you ll have no quarrel with me so much the better then for charlotte went on with a higher and higher flight my plan is completely formed maggie waited her glimmer had deepened her chance somehow was at hand the only danger was her spoiling it she felt herself skirting an abyss what then may i ask is your plan it hung fire but ten seconds it came out sharp to take him home to his real position and not to wait do you mean a this season i mean immediately and i may as well tell you now i mean for my own time i want charlotte said to have him at last a little to myself i want strange as it may seem to you and she gave it all its weight to keep the man i ve married and to do so i see i must act maggie with the effort still to follow the right line felt herself colour to the eyes immediately she thoughtfully echoed as soon as we can get off the removal of everything is after all but a detail that can always be done with money as he spends it everything can what i ask for charlotte declared is the definite break and i wish it now with which her head like her voice rose higher oh she added i know my difficulty far down below the level of attention in she could scarce have said what sacred depths maggie s inspiration had come and it had trembled the next moment into sound do you mean i m your difficulty you and he together since it s always with you that i ve had to see him but it s a difficulty that i m facing if you wish to know that i ve already faced that i propose to myself to surmount the struggle with it none too pleasant hasn t been for me as you may imagine in itself charming i ve felt in it at times if i must tell you all too great and too strange an ugliness yet i believe it may succeed she had risen with this mrs verver and had moved for the emphasis of it a few steps away while maggie motionless at first but sat and looked at her you want to take my father from me the sharp successful almost primitive wail in it made charlotte turn and this movement attested for the princess the felicity of her deceit something in her throbbed as it had throbbed the night she stood in the drawing room and denied that she had suffered she was ready to lie again if her companion would but give her the opening then she should know she had done all charlotte looked at her hard as if to compare her face with her note of resentment and maggie feeling this met it with the signs of an impression that might pass for the impression of defeat i want really to possess him said mrs verver i happen also to feel that he s worth it maggie rose as if to receive her oh worth it she wonderfully threw off the tone she instantly saw again had its effect charlotte flamed aloft might truly have been believing in her passionate parade you ve thought you ve known what he s worth indeed then my dear i believe i have as i believe i still do she had given it maggie straight back and again it had not missed charlotte for another moment only looked at her then broke into the words maggie had known they would come of which she had pressed the spring how i see that you loathed our marriage do you ask me maggie after an instant demanded charlotte had looked about her picked up the parasol she had laid on a bench possessed herself mechanically of one of the volumes of the relegated novel and then more consciously flung it down again she was in presence visibly of her last word she opened her sunshade with a click she twirled it on her shoulder in her pride ask you do i need how i see she broke out that you ve worked against me oh oh oh the princess exclaimed her companion leaving her had reached one of the archways but on this turned round with a flare you haven t worked against me maggie took it and for a moment kept it held it with closed eyes as if it had been some captured fluttering bird pressed by both hands to her breast then she opened her eyes to speak what does it matter if i ve failed you recognise then that you ve failed asked charlotte from the threshold maggie waited she looked as her companion had done a moment before at the two books on the seat she put them together and laid them down then she made up her mind i ve failed she sounded out before charlotte having given her time walked away she watched her splendid and erect float down the long vista then she sank upon a seat yes she had done all part sixth xl i ll do anything you like she said to her husband on one of the last days of the month if our being here this way at this time seems to you too absurd or too uncomfortable or too impossible we ll either take leave of them now without waiting or we ll come back in time three days before they start i ll go abroad with you if you but say the word to switzerland the tyrol the italian alps to whichever of your old high places you would like most to see again those beautiful ones that used to do you good after rome and that you so often told me about where they were in the conditions that prompted this offer and where it might indeed appear ridiculous that with the stale london september close at hand they should content themselves with remaining was where the desert of portland place looked blank as it had never looked and where a drowsy cabman scanning the horizon for a fare could sink to oblivion of the risks of immobility but amerigo was of the odd opinion day after day that their situation couldn t be bettered and he even went at no moment through the form of replying that should their ordeal strike her as exceeding their patience any step they might take would be for her own relief this was no doubt partly because he stood out so wonderfully to the end against admitting by a weak word at least that any element of their existence was or ever had been an ordeal no trap of circumstance no lapse of form no accident of irritation had landed him in that inconsequence his wife might verily have suggested that he was consequent consequent with the admirable appearance he had from the first so undertaken and so continued to present rather too rigidly at her expense only as it happened she was not the little person to do anything of the sort and the strange tacit compact actually in operation between them might have been founded on an intelligent comparison a definite collation positively of the kinds of patience proper to each she was seeing him through he had engaged to come out at the right end if she would see him this understanding tacitly renewed from week to week had fairly received with the procession of the weeks the consecration of time but it scarce needed to be insisted on that she was seeing him on his terms not all on hers or that in other words she must allow him his unexplained and uncharted his one practicably workable way if that way by one of the intimate felicities the liability to which was so far from having even yet completely fallen from him happened handsomely to show him as more bored than boring with advantages of his own freely to surrender but none to be persuadedly indebted to others for what did such a false face of the matter represent but the fact itself that she was pledged if she had questioned or challenged or interfered if she had reserved herself that right she wouldn t have been pledged whereas there were still and evidently would be yet a while long tense stretches during which their case might have been hanging for every eye on her possible her impossible defection she must keep it up to the last mustn t absent herself for three minutes from her post only on those lines assuredly would she show herself as with him and not against him it was extraordinary how scant a series of signs she had invited him to make of being of truly having been at any time with his wife that reflection she was not exempt from as they now in their suspense supremely waited a reflection under the brush of which she recognised her having had in respect to him as well to do all to go the whole way over to move indefatigably while he stood as fixed in his place as some statue of one of his forefathers the meaning of it would seem to be she reasoned in sequestered hours that he had a place and that this was an attribute somehow indefeasible unquenchable which laid upon others from the moment they definitely wanted anything of him the necessity of taking more of the steps that he could of circling round him of remembering for his benefit the famous relation of the mountain to mahomet it was strange if one had gone into it but such a place as amerigo s was like something made for him beforehand by innumerable facts facts largely of the sort known as historical made by ancestors examples traditions habits while maggie s own had come to show simply as that improvised post a post of the kind spoken of as advanced with which she was to have found herself connected in the fashion of a settler or a trader in a new country in the likeness even of some indian squaw with a papoose on her back and barbarous bead work to sell maggie s own in short would have been sought in vain in the most rudimentary map of the social relations as such the only geography marking it would be doubtless that of the fundamental passions the end that the prince was at all events holding out for was represented to expectation by his father in law s announced departure for america with mrs verver just as that prospective event had originally figured as advising for discretion the flight of the younger couple to say nothing of the withdrawal of whatever other importunate company before the great upheaval of fawns this residence was to be peopled for a month by porters packers and hammerers at whose operations it had become peculiarly public public that is for portland place that charlotte was to preside in force operations the quite awful appointed scale and style of which had at no moment loomed so large to maggie s mind as one day when the dear assinghams swam back into her ken besprinkled with sawdust and looking as pale as if they had seen samson pull down the temple they had seen at least what she was not seeing rich dim things under the impression of which they had retired she having eyes at present but for the clock by which she timed her husband or for the glass the image perhaps would be truer in which he was reflected to her as he timed the pair in the country the accession of their friends from cadogan place contributed to all their intermissions at any rate a certain effect of resonance an effect especially marked by the upshot of a prompt exchange of inquiries between mrs assingham and the princess it was noted on the occasion of that anxious lady s last approach to her young friend at fawns that her sympathy had ventured after much accepted privation again to become inquisitive and it had perhaps never so yielded to that need as on this question of the present odd line of the distinguished eccentrics you mean to say really that you re going to stick here and then before maggie could answer what on earth will you do with your evenings maggie waited a moment maggie could still tentatively smile when people learn we re here and of course the papers will be full of it they ll flock back in their hundreds from wherever they are to catch us you see you and the colonel have yourselves done it as for our evenings they won t i dare say be particularly different from anything else that s ours they won t be different from our mornings or our afternoons except perhaps that you two dears will sometimes help us to get through them i ve offered to go anywhere she added to take a house if he will but this just this and nothing else is amerigo s idea he gave it yesterday she went on a name that as he said described and fitted it so you see and the princess indulged again in her smile that didn t play but that only as might have been said worked so you see there s a method in our madness it drew mrs assingham s wonder and what then is the name the reduction to its simplest expression of what we are doing that s what he called it therefore as we re doing nothing we re doing it in the most aggravated way which is the way he desires with which maggie further said of course i understand so do i her visitor after a moment breathed you ve had to vacate the house that was inevitable but at least here he doesn t funk our young woman accepted the expression he doesn t funk it only however half contented fanny who thoughtfully raised her eyebrows he s prodigious but what is there as you ve fixed it to dodge unless she pursued it s her getting near him it s if you ll pardon my vulgarity her getting at him that she suggested may count with him but it found the princess prepared she can get near him here she can get at him she can come up can she fanny assingham questioned can t she maggie returned their eyes for a minute intimately met on it after which the elder woman said i mean for seeing him alone so do i said the princess at which fanny for her reasons couldn t help smiling oh if it s for that he s staying he s staying i ve made it out to take anything that comes or calls upon him to take maggie went on even that then she put it as she had at last put it to herself he s staying for high decency decency mrs assingham gravely echoed decency if she should try well mrs assingham urged well i hope hope he ll see her maggie hesitated however she made no direct reply it s useless hoping she presently said she won t but he ought to her friend s expression of a moment before which had been apologised for as vulgar prolonged its sharpness to her ear that of an electric bell under continued pressure stated so simply what was it but dreadful truly that the feasibility of charlotte s getting at the man who for so long had loved her should now be in question strangest of all things doubtless this care of maggie s as to what might make for it or make against it stranger still her fairly lapsing at moments into a vague calculation of the conceivability on her own part with her husband of some direct sounding of the subject would it be too monstrous her suddenly breaking out to him as in alarm at the lapse of the weeks wouldn t it really seem that you re bound in honour to do something for her privately before they go maggie was capable of weighing the risk of this adventure for her own spirit capable of sinking to intense little absences even while conversing as now with the person who had most of her confidence during which she followed up the possibilities it was true that mrs assingham could at such times somewhat restore the balance by not wholly failing to guess her thought her thought however just at present had more than one face had a series that it successively presented these were indeed the possibilities involved in the adventure of her concerning herself for the quantity of compensation that mrs verver might still look to there was always the possibility that she was after all sufficiently to get at him there was in fact that of her having again and again done so against this stood nothing but fanny assingham s apparent belief in her privation more mercilessly imposed or more hopelessly felt in the actual relation of the parties over and beyond everything that from more than three months back of course had fostered in the princess a like conviction these assumptions might certainly be baseless inasmuch as there were hours and hours of amerigo s time that there was no habit no pretence of his accounting for inasmuch too as charlotte inevitably had had more than once to the undisguised knowledge of the pair in portland place been obliged to come up to eaton square whence so many of her personal possessions were in course of removal she didn t come to portland place didn t even come to ask for luncheon on two separate occasions when it reached the consciousness of the household there that she was spending the day in london maggie hated she scorned to compare hours and appearances to weigh the idea of whether there hadn t been moments during these days when an assignation in easy conditions a snatched interview in an air the season had so cleared of prying eyes mightn t perfectly work but the very reason of this was partly that haunted with the vision of the poor woman carrying off with such bravery as she found to her hand the secret of her not being appeased she was conscious of scant room for any alternative image the alternative image would have been that the secret covered up was the secret of appeasement somehow obtained somehow extorted and cherished and the difference between the two kinds of hiding was too great to permit of a mistake charlotte was hiding neither pride nor joy she was hiding humiliation and here it was that the princess s passion so powerless for vindictive flights most inveterately bruised its tenderness against the hard glass of her question behind the glass lurked the whole history of the relation she had so fairly flattened her nose against it to penetrate the glass mrs verver might at this stage have been frantically tapping from within by way of supreme irrepressible entreaty maggie had said to herself complacently after that last passage with her stepmother in the garden of fawns that there was nothing left for her to do and that she could thereupon fold her hands but why wasn t it still left to push further and from the point of view of personal pride grovel lower why wasn t it still left to offer herself as the bearer of a message reporting to him their friend s anguish and convincing him of her need she could thus have translated mrs verver s tap against the glass as i have called it into fifty forms could perhaps have translated it most into the form of a reminder that would pierce deep you don t know what it is to have been loved and broken with you haven t been broken with because in your relation what can there have been worth speaking of to break ours was everything a relation could be filled to the brim with the wine of consciousness and if it was to have no meaning no better meaning than that such a creature as you could breathe upon it at your hour for blight why was i myself dealt with all for deception why condemned after a couple of short years to find the golden flame oh the golden flame a mere handful of black ashes our young woman so yielded at moments to what was insidious in these foredoomed ingenuities of her pity that for minutes together sometimes the weight of a new duty seemed to rest upon her the duty of speaking before separation should constitute its chasm of pleading for some benefit that might be carried away into exile like the last saved object of price of the emigre the jewel wrapped in a piece of old silk and negotiable some day in the market of misery this imagined service to the woman who could no longer help herself was one of the traps set for maggie s spirit at every turn of the road the click of which catching and holding the divine faculty fast was followed inevitably by a flutter by a struggle of wings and even as we may say by a scattering of fine feathers for they promptly enough felt these yearnings of thought and excursions of sympathy the concussion that couldn t bring them down the arrest produced by the so remarkably distinct figure that at fawns for the previous weeks was constantly crossing in its regular revolution the further end of any watched perspective whoever knew or whoever didn t whether or to what extent charlotte with natural business in eaton square had shuffled other opportunities under that cloak it was all matter for the kind of quiet ponderation the little man who so kept his wandering way had made his own it was part of the very inveteracy of his straw hat and his white waistcoat of the trick of his hands in his pockets of the detachment of the attention he fixed on his slow steps from behind his secure pince nez the thing that never failed now as an item in the picture was that gleam of the silken noose his wife s immaterial tether so marked to maggie s sense during her last month in the country mrs verver s straight neck had certainly not slipped it nor had the other end of the long cord oh quite conveniently long disengaged its smaller loop from the hooked thumb that with his fingers closed upon it her husband kept out of sight to have recognised for all its tenuity the play of this gathered lasso might inevitably be to wonder with what magic it was twisted to what tension subjected but could never be to doubt either of its adequacy to its office or of its perfect durability these reminded states for the princess were in fact states of renewed gaping so many things her father knew that she even yet didn t all this at present with mrs assingham passed through her in quick vibrations she had expressed while the revolution of her thought was incomplete the idea of what amerigo ought on his side in the premises to be capable of and then had felt her companion s answering stare but she insisted on what she had meant he ought to wish to see her and i mean in some protected and independent way as he used to in case of her being herself able to manage it that said maggie with the courage of her conviction he ought to be ready he ought to be happy he ought to feel himself sworn little as it is for the end of such a history to take from her it s as if he wished to get off without taking anything mrs assingham deferentially mused but for what purpose is it your idea that they should again so intimately meet for any purpose they like that s their affair fanny assingham sharply laughed then irrepressibly fell back to her constant position you re splendid perfectly splendid to which as the princess shaking an impatient head wouldn t have it again at all she subjoined or if you re not it s because you re so sure i mean sure of him ah i m exactly not sure of him if i were sure of him i shouldn t doubt but maggie cast about her doubt what fanny pressed as she waited well that he must feel how much less than she he pays and how that ought to keep her present to him this in its turn after an instant mrs assingham could meet with a smile trust him my dear to keep her present but trust him also to keep himself absent leave him his own way i ll leave him everything said maggie only you know it s my nature i think it s your nature to think too much fanny assingham a trifle coarsely risked this but quickened however in the princess the act she reprobated that may be but if i hadn t thought you wouldn t you mean have been where you are yes because they on their side thought of everything but that they thought of everything but that i might think or even her friend too superficially concurred that your father might as to this at all events maggie discriminated no that wouldn t have prevented them for they knew that his first care would be not to make me do so as it is maggie added that has had to become his last fanny assingham took it in deeper for what it immediately made her give out louder he s splendid then she sounded it almost aggressively it was what she was reduced to she had positively to place it ah that as much as you please maggie said this and left it but the tone of it had the next moment determined in her friend a fresh reaction you think both of you so abysmally and yet so quietly but it s what will have saved you oh maggie returned it s what from the moment they discovered we could think at all will have saved them for they re the ones who are saved she went on we re the ones who are lost lost lost to each other father and i and then as her friend appeared to demur oh yes maggie quite lucidly declared lost to each other much more really than amerigo and charlotte are since for them it s just it s right it s deserved while for us it s only sad and strange and not caused by our fault but i don t know she went on why i talk about myself for it s on father it really comes i let him go said maggie you let him but you don t make him i take it from him she answered but what else can you do i take it from him the princess repeated i do what i knew from the first i should do i get off by giving him up but if he gives you mrs assingham presumed to object doesn t it moreover then she asked complete the very purpose with which he married that of making you and leaving you more free maggie looked at her long yes i help him to do that mrs assingham hesitated but at last her bravery flared why not call it then frankly his complete success well said maggie that s all that s left me to do it s a success her friend ingeniously developed with which you ve simply not interfered and as if to show that she spoke without levity mrs assingham went further he has made it a success for them ah there you are maggie responsively mused yes she said the next moment that s why amerigo stays let alone it s why charlotte goes that mrs assingham and emboldened smiled so he knows but maggie hung back amerigo after which however she blushed to her companion s recognition your father he knows what you know i mean fanny faltered well how much does he know maggie s silence and maggie s eyes had in fact arrested the push of the question which for a decent consistency she couldn t yet quite abandon what i should rather say is does he know how much she found it still awkward how much i mean they did how far she touched it up they went maggie had waited but only with a question do you think he does know at least something oh about him i can t think he s beyond me said fanny assingham then do you yourself know how much how much how far how far fanny had appeared to wish to make sure but there was something she remembered remembered in time and even with a smile i ve told you before that i know absolutely nothing well that s what i know said the princess her friend again hesitated then nobody knows i mean mrs assingham explained how much your father does oh maggie showed that she understood nobody not a little charlotte a little the princess echoed to know anything would be for her to know enough and she doesn t know anything if she did maggie answered amerigo would and that s just it that he doesn t that s just it said the princess profoundly on which mrs assingham reflected then how is charlotte so held just by that by her ignorance by her ignorance fanny wondered a torment a torment said maggie with tears in her eyes her companion a moment watched them but the prince then how is he held maggie asked how is he held oh i can t tell you that and the princess again broke off xli a telegram in charlotte s name arrived early we shall come and ask you for tea at five if convenient to you am wiring for the assinghams to lunch this document into which meanings were to be read maggie promptly placed before her husband adding the remark that her father and his wife who would have come up the previous night or that morning had evidently gone to an hotel the prince was in his own room where he often sat now alone half a dozen open newspapers the figaro notably as well as the times were scattered about him but with a cigar in his teeth and a visible cloud on his brow he appeared actually to be engaged in walking to and fro never yet on thus approaching him for she had done it of late under one necessity or another several times had a particular impression so greeted her supremely strong for some reason as he turned quickly round on her entrance the reason was partly the look in his face a suffusion like the flush of fever which brought back to her fanny assingham s charge recently uttered under that roof of her thinking too impenetrably the word had remained with her and made her think still more so that at first as she stood there she felt responsible for provoking on his part an irritation of suspense at which she had not aimed she had been going about him these three months she perfectly knew with a maintained idea of which she had never spoken to him but what had at last happened was that his way of looking at her on occasion seemed a perception of the presence not of one idea but of fifty variously prepared for uses with which he somehow must reckon she knew herself suddenly almost strangely glad to be coming to him at this hour with nothing more abstract than a telegram but even after she had stepped into his prison under her pretext while her eyes took in his face and then embraced the four walls that enclosed his restlessness she recognised the virtual identity of his condition with that aspect of charlotte s situation for which early in the summer and in all the amplitude of a great residence she had found with so little seeking the similitude of the locked cage he struck her as caged the man who couldn t now without an instant effect on her sensibility give an instinctive push to the door she had not completely closed behind her he had been turning twenty ways for impatiences all his own and when she was once shut in with him it was yet again as if she had come to him in his more than monastic cell to offer him light or food there was a difference none the less between his captivity and charlotte s the difference as it might be of his lurking there by his own act and his own choice the admission of which had indeed virtually been in his starting on her entrance as if even this were in its degree an interference that was what betrayed for her practically his fear of her fifty ideas and what had begun after a minute to make her wish to repudiate or explain it was more wonderful than she could have told it was for all the world as if she was succeeding with him beyond her intention she had for these instants the sense that he exaggerated that the imputation of purpose had fairly risen too high in him she had begun a year ago by asking herself how she could make him think more of her but what was it after all he was thinking now he kept his eyes on her telegram he read it more than once easy as it was in spite of its conveyed deprecation to understand during which she found herself almost awestruck with yearning almost on the point of marking somehow what she had marked in the garden at fawns with charlotte that she had truly come unarmed she didn t bristle with intentions she scarce knew as he at this juncture affected her what had become of the only intention she had come with she had nothing but her old idea the old one he knew she hadn t the ghost of another presently in fact when four or five minutes had elapsed it was as if she positively hadn t so much even as that one he gave her back her paper asking with it if there were anything in particular she wished him to do she stood there with her eyes on him doubling the telegram together as if it had been a precious thing and yet all the while holding her breath of a sudden somehow and quite as by the action of their merely having between them these few written words an extraordinary fact came up he was with her as if he were hers hers in a degree and on a scale with an intensity and an intimacy that were a new and a strange quantity that were like the irruption of a tide loosening them where they had stuck and making them feel they floated what was it that with the rush of this just kept her from putting out her hands to him from catching at him as in the other time with the superficial impetus he and charlotte had privately conspired to impart she had so often her breath failing her known the impulse to catch at her father she did however just yet nothing inconsequent though she couldn t immediately have said what saved her and by the time she had neatly folded her telegram she was doing something merely needful i wanted you simply to know so that you mayn t by accident miss them for it s the last said maggie the last i take it as their good bye and she smiled as she could always smile they come in state to take formal leave they do everything that s proper tomorrow she said they go to southampton if they do everything that s proper the prince presently asked why don t they at least come to dine she hesitated yet she lightly enough provided her answer that we must certainly ask them it will be easy for you but of course they re immensely taken he wondered so immensely taken that they can t that your father can t give you his last evening in england this for maggie was more difficult to meet yet she was still not without her stop gap that may be what they ll propose that we shall go somewhere together the four of us for a celebration except that to round it thoroughly off we ought also to have fanny and the colonel they don t want them at tea she quite sufficiently expresses they polish them off poor dears they get rid of them beforehand they want only us together and if they cut us down to tea she continued as they cut fanny and the colonel down to luncheon perhaps it s for the fancy after all of their keeping their last night in london for each other she said these things as they came to her she was unable to keep them back even though as she heard herself she might have been throwing everything to the winds but wasn t that the right way for sharing his last day of captivity with the man one adored it was every moment more and more for her as if she were waiting with him in his prison waiting with some gleam of remembrance of how noble captives in the french revolution the darkness of the terror used to make a feast or a high discourse of their last poor resources if she had broken with everything now every observance of all the past months she must simply then take it so take it that what she had worked for was too near at last to let her keep her head she might have been losing her head verily in her husband s eyes since he didn t know all the while that the sudden freedom of her words was but the diverted intensity of her disposition personally to seize him he didn t know either that this was her manner now she was with him of beguiling audaciously the supremacy of suspense for the people of the french revolution assuredly there wasn t suspense the scaffold for those she was thinking of was certain whereas what charlotte s telegram announced was short of some incalculable error clear liberation just the point however was in its being clearer to herself than to him her clearnesses clearances those she had so all but abjectly laboured for threatened to crowd upon her in the form of one of the clusters of angelic heads the peopled shafts of light beating down through iron bars that regale on occasion precisely the fevered vision of those who are in chains she was going to know she felt later on was going to know with compunction doubtless on the very morrow how thumpingly her heart had beaten at this foretaste of their being left together she should judge at leisure the surrender she was making to the consciousness of complications about to be bodily lifted she should judge at leisure even that avidity for an issue which was making so little of any complication but the unextinguished presence of the others and indeed that she was already simplifying so much more than her husband came out for her next in the face with which he listened he might certainly well be puzzled in respect to his father in law and mrs verver by her glance at their possible preference for a concentrated evening but it isn t is it he asked as if they were leaving each other oh no it isn t as if they were leaving each other they re only bringing to a close without knowing when it may open again a time that has been naturally awfully interesting to them yes she could talk so of their time she was somehow sustained she was sustained even to affirm more intensely her present possession of her ground they have their reasons many things to think of how can one tell but there s always also the chance of his proposing to me that we shall have our last hours together i mean that he and i shall he may wish to take me off to dine with him somewhere alone and to do it in memory of old days i mean the princess went on the real old days before my grand husband was invented and much more before his grand wife was the wonderful times of his first great interest in what he has since done his first great plans and opportunities discoveries and bargains the way we ve sat together late ever so late in foreign restaurants which he used to like the way that in every city in europe we ve stayed on and on with our elbows on the table and most of the lights put out to talk over things he had that day seen or heard of or made his offer for the things he had secured or refused or lost there were places he took me to you wouldn t believe for often he could only have left me with servants if he should carry me off with him to night for old sake s sake to the earl s court exhibition it will be a little just a very very little like our young adventures after which while amerigo watched her and in fact quite because of it she had an inspiration to which she presently yielded if he was wondering what she would say next she had found exactly the thing in that case he will leave you charlotte to take care of in our absence you ll have to carry her off somewhere for your last evening unless you may prefer to spend it with her here i shall then see that you dine that you have everything quite beautifully you ll be able to do as you like she couldn t have been sure beforehand and had really not been but the most immediate result of this speech was his letting her see that he took it for no cheap extravagance either of irony or of oblivion nothing in the world of a truth had ever been so sweet to her as his look of trying to be serious enough to make no mistake about it she troubled him which hadn t been at all her purpose she mystified him which she couldn t help and comparatively didn t mind then it came over her that he had after all a simplicity very considerable on which she had never dared to presume it was a discovery not like the other discovery she had once made but giving out a freshness and she recognised again in the light of it the number of the ideas of which he thought her capable they were all apparently queer for him but she had at least with the lapse of the months created the perception that there might be something in them whereby he stared there beautiful and sombre at what she was at present providing him with there was something of his own in his mind to which she was sure he referred everything for a measure and a meaning he had never let go of it from the evening weeks before when in her room after his encounter with the bloomsbury cup she had planted it there by flinging it at him on the question of her father s view of him her determined find out for yourself she had been aware during the months that he had been trying to find out and had been seeking above all to avoid the appearance of any evasions of such a form of knowledge as might reach him with violence or with a penetration more insidious from any other source nothing however had reached him nothing he could at all conveniently reckon with had disengaged itself for him even from the announcement sufficiently sudden of the final secession of their companions charlotte was in pain charlotte was in torment but he himself had given her reason enough for that and in respect to the rest of the whole matter of her obligation to follow her husband that personage and she maggie had so shuffled away every link between consequence and cause that the intention remained like some famous poetic line in a dead language subject to varieties of interpretation what renewed the obscurity was her strange image of their common offer to him her father s and her own of an opportunity to separate from mrs verver with the due amount of form and all the more that he was in so pathetic a way unable to treat himself to a quarrel with it on the score of taste taste in him as a touchstone was now all at sea for who could say but that one of her fifty ideas or perhaps forty nine of them wouldn t be exactly that taste by itself the taste he had always conformed to had no importance whatever if meanwhile at all events he felt her as serious this made the greater reason for her profiting by it as she perhaps might never be able to profit again she was invoking that reflection at the very moment he brought out in reply to her last words a remark which though perfectly relevant and perfectly just affected her at first as a high oddity they re doing the wisest thing you know for if they were ever to go and he looked down at her over his cigar if they were ever to go in short it was high time with her father s age charlotte s need of initiation and the general magnitude of the job of their getting settled and seasoned their learning to live into their queer future it was high time that they should take up their courage this was eminent sense but it didn t arrest the princess who the next moment had found a form for her challenge but shan t you then so much as miss her a little she s wonderful and beautiful and i feel somehow as if she were dying not really not physically maggie went on she s so far naturally splendid as she is from having done with life but dying for us for you and me and making us feel it by the very fact of there being so much of her left the prince smoked hard a minute as you say she s splendid but there is there always will be much of her left only as you also say for others and yet i think the princess returned that it isn t as if we had wholly done with her how can we not always think of her it s as if her unhappiness had been necessary to us as if we had needed her at her own cost to build us up and start us he took it in with consideration but he met it with a lucid inquiry why do you speak of the unhappiness of your father s wife they exchanged a long look the time that it took her to find her reply because not to well not to would make me have to speak of him and i can t said maggie speak of him you can t i can t she said it as for definite notice not to be repeated there are too many things she nevertheless added he s too great the prince looked at his cigar tip and then as he put back the weed too great for whom upon which as she hesitated not my dear too great for you he declared for me oh as much as you like too great for me is what i mean i know why i think it maggie said that s enough he looked at her yet again as if she but fanned his wonder he was on the very point she judged of asking her why she thought it but her own eyes maintained their warning and at the end of a minute he had uttered other words what s of importance is that you re his daughter that at least we ve got and i suppose that if i may say nothing else i may say at least that i value it oh yes you may say that you value it i myself make the most of it this again he took in letting it presently put forth for him a striking connection she ought to have known you that s what s present to me she ought to have understood you better better than you did yes he gravely maintained better than i did and she didn t really know you at all she doesn t know you now ah yes she does said maggie but he shook his head he knew what he meant she not only doesn t understand you more than i she understands you ever so much less though even i well even you maggie pressed as he paused even i even i even yet again he paused and the silence held them but maggie at last broke it if charlotte doesn t understand me it is that i ve prevented her i ve chosen to deceive her and to lie to her the prince kept his eyes on her i know what you ve chosen to do but i ve chosen to do the same yes said maggie after an instant my choice was made when i had guessed yours but you mean she asked that she understands you it presents small difficulty are you so sure maggie went on sure enough but it doesn t matter he waited an instant then looking up through the fumes of his smoke she s stupid he abruptly opined o oh maggie protested in a long wail it had made him in fact quickly change colour what i mean is that she s not as you pronounce her unhappy and he recovered with this all his logic why is she unhappy if she doesn t know doesn t know she tried to make his logic difficult doesn t know that you know it came from him in such a way that she was conscious instantly of three or four things to answer but what she said first was do you think that s all it need take and before he could reply she knows she knows maggie proclaimed well then what but she threw back her head she turned impatiently away from him oh i needn t tell you she knows enough besides she went on she doesn t believe us it made the prince stare a little ah she asks too much that drew however from his wife another moan of objection which determined in him a judgment she won t let you take her for unhappy oh i know better than any one else what she won t let me take her for very well said amerigo you ll see i shall see wonders i know i ve already seen them and i m prepared for them maggie recalled she had memories enough it s terrible her memories prompted her to speak i see it s always terrible for women the prince looked down in his gravity everything s terrible cara in the heart of man she s making her life he said she ll make it his wife turned back upon him she had wandered to a table vaguely setting objects straight a little by the way then too while she s about it she s making ours at this he raised his eyes which met her own and she held him while she delivered herself of some thing that had been with her these last minutes you spoke just now of charlotte s not having learned from you that i know am i to take from you then that you accept and recognise my knowledge he did the inquiry all the honours visibly weighed its importance and weighed his response you think i might have been showing you that a little more handsomely it isn t a question of any beauty said maggie it s only a question of the quantity of truth oh the quantity of truth the prince richly though ambiguously murmured that s a thing by itself yes but there are also such things all the same as questions of good faith of course there are the prince hastened to reply after which he brought up more slowly if ever a man since the beginning of time acted in good faith but he dropped it offering it simply for that for that then when it had had time somewhat to settle like some handful of gold dust thrown into the air for that then maggie showed herself as deeply and strangely taking it i see and she even wished this form to be as complete as she could make it i see the completeness clearly after an instant had struck him as divine ah my dear my dear my dear it was all he could say she wasn t talking however at large you ve kept up for so long a silence yes yes i know what i ve kept up but will you do he asked still one thing more for me it was as if for an instant with her new exposure it had made her turn pale is there even one thing left ah my dear my dear my dear it had pressed again in him the fine spring of the unspeakable there was nothing however that the princess herself couldn t say i ll do anything if you ll tell me what then wait and his raised italian hand with its play of admonitory fingers had never made gesture more expressive his voice itself dropped to a tone wait he repeated wait she understood but it was as if she wished to have it from him till they ve been here you mean yes till they ve gone till they re away she kept it up till they ve left the country she had her eyes on him for clearness these were the conditions of a promise so that he put the promise practically into his response till we ve ceased to see them for as long as god may grant till we re really alone oh if it s only that when she had drawn from him thus then as she could feel the thick breath of the definite which was the intimate the immediate the familiar as she hadn t had them for so long she turned away again she put her hand on the knob of the door but her hand rested at first without a grasp she had another effort to make the effort of leaving him of which everything that had just passed between them his presence irresistible overcharged with it doubled the difficulty there was something she couldn t have told what it was as if shut in together they had come too far too far for where they were so that the mere act of her quitting him was like the attempt to recover the lost and gone she had taken in with her something that within the ten minutes and especially within the last three or four had slipped away from her which it was vain now wasn t it to try to appear to clutch or to pick up that consciousness in fact had a pang and she balanced intensely for the lingering moment almost with a terror of her endless power of surrender he had only to press really for her to yield inch by inch and she fairly knew at present while she looked at him through her cloud that the confession of this precious secret sat there for him to pluck the sensation for the few seconds was extraordinary her weakness her desire so long as she was yet not saving herself flowered in her face like a light or a darkness she sought for some word that would cover this up she reverted to the question of tea speaking as if they shouldn t meet sooner then about five i count on you on him too however something had descended as to which this exactly gave him his chance ah but i shall see you no he said coming nearer she had with her hand still on the knob her back against the door so that her retreat under his approach must be less than a step and yet she couldn t for her life with the other hand have pushed him away he was so near now that she could touch him taste him smell him kiss him hold him he almost pressed upon her and the warmth of his face frowning smiling she mightn t know which only beautiful and strange was bent upon her with the largeness with which objects loom in dreams she closed her eyes to it and so the next instant against her purpose she had put out her hand which had met his own and which he held then it was that from behind her closed eyes the right word came wait it was the word of his own distress and entreaty the word for both of them all they had left their plank now on the great sea their hands were locked and thus she said it again wait wait she kept her eyes shut but her hand she knew helped her meaning which after a minute she was aware his own had absorbed he let her go he turned away with this message and when she saw him again his back was presented as he had left her and his face staring out of the window she had saved herself and she got off xlii later on in the afternoon before the others arrived the form of their reunion was at least remarkable they might in their great eastward drawing room have been comparing notes or nerves in apprehension of some stiff official visit maggie s mind in its restlessness even played a little with the prospect the high cool room with its afternoon shade with its old tapestries uncovered with the perfect polish of its wide floor reflecting the bowls of gathered flowers and the silver and linen of the prepared tea table drew from her a remark in which this whole effect was mirrored as well as something else in the prince s movement while he slowly paced and turned we re distinctly bourgeois she a trifle grimly threw off as an echo of their old community though to a spectator sufficiently detached they might have been quite the privileged pair they were reputed granted only they were taken as awaiting the visit of royalty they might have been ready on the word passed up in advance to repair together to the foot of the staircase the prince somewhat in front advancing indeed to the open doors and even going down for all his princedom to meet on the stopping of the chariot the august emergence the time was stale it was to be admitted for incidents of magnitude the september hush was in full possession at the end of the dull day and a couple of the long windows stood open to the balcony that overhung the desolation the balcony from which maggie in the springtime had seen amerigo and charlotte look down together at the hour of her return from the regent s park near by with her father the principino and miss bogle amerigo now again in his punctual impatience went out a couple of times and stood there after which as to report that nothing was in sight he returned to the room with frankly nothing else to do the princess pretended to read he looked at her as he passed there hovered in her own sense the thought of other occasions when she had cheated appearances of agitation with a book at last she felt him standing before her and then she raised her eyes do you remember how this morning when you told me of this event i asked you if there were anything particular you wished me to do you spoke of my being at home but that was a matter of course you spoke of something else he went on while she sat with her book on her knee and her raised eyes something that makes me almost wish it may happen you spoke he said of the possibility of my seeing her alone do you know if that comes he asked the use i shall make of it and then as she waited the use is all before me ah it s your own business now said his wife but it had made her rise i shall make it my own he answered i shall tell her i lied to her ah no she returned and i shall tell her you did she shook her head again oh still less with which therefore they stood at difference he with his head erect and his happy idea perched in its eagerness on his crest and how then is she to know she isn t to know she s only still to think you don t and therefore that i m always a fool she may think said maggie what she likes think it without my protest the princess made a movement what business is it of yours isn t it my right to correct her maggie let his question ring ring long enough for him to hear it himself only then she took it up correct her and it was her own now that really rang aren t you rather forgetting who she is after which while he quite stared for it as it was the very first clear majesty he had known her to use she flung down her book and raised a warning hand the carriage come the come had matched for lucid firmness the rest of her speech and when they were below in the hall there was a go for him through the open doors and between the ranged servants that matched even that he received royalty bareheaded therefore in the persons of mr and mrs verver as it alighted on the pavement and maggie was at the threshold to welcome it to her house later on upstairs again she even herself felt still more the force of the limit of which she had just reminded him at tea in charlotte s affirmed presence as charlotte affirmed it she drew a long breath of richer relief it was the strangest once more of all impressions but what she most felt for the half hour was that mr and mrs verver were making the occasion easy they were somehow conjoined in it conjoined for a present effect as maggie had absolutely never yet seen them and there occurred before long a moment in which amerigo s look met her own in recognitions that he couldn t suppress the question of the amount of correction to which charlotte had laid herself open rose and hovered for the instant only to sink conspicuously by its own weight so high a pitch she seemed to give to the unconsciousness of questions so resplendent a show of serenity she succeeded in making the shade of the official in her beauty and security never for a moment dropped it was a cool high refuge like the deep arched recess of some coloured and gilded image in which she sat and smiled and waited drank her tea referred to her husband and remembered her mission her mission had quite taken form it was but another name for the interest of her great opportunity that of representing the arts and the graces to a people languishing afar off in ignorance maggie had sufficiently intimated to the prince ten minutes before that she needed no showing as to what their friend wouldn t consent to be taken for but the difficulty now indeed was to choose for explicit tribute of admiration between the varieties of her nobler aspects she carried it off to put the matter coarsely with a taste and a discretion that held our young woman s attention for the first quarter of an hour to the very point of diverting it from the attitude of her overshadowed her almost superseded companion but adam verver profited indeed at this time even with his daughter by his so marked peculiarity of seeming on no occasion to have an attitude and so long as they were in the room together she felt him still simply weave his web and play out his long fine cord knew herself in presence of this tacit process very much as she had known herself at fawns he had a way the dear man wherever he was of moving about the room noiselessly to see what it might contain and his manner of now resorting to this habit acquainted as he already was with the objects in view expressed with a certain sharpness the intention of leaving his wife to her devices it did even more than this it signified to the apprehension of the princess from the moment she more directly took thought of him almost a special view of these devices as actually exhibited in their rarity together with an independent a settled appreciation of their general handsome adequacy which scarcely required the accompaniment of his faint contemplative hum charlotte throned as who should say between her hostess and her host the whole scene having crystallised as soon as she took her place to the right quiet lustre the harmony was not less sustained for being superficial and the only approach to a break in it was while amerigo remained standing long enough for his father in law vaguely wondering to appeal to him invite or address him and then in default of any such word selected for presentation to the other visitor a plate of petits fours maggie watched her husband if it now could be called watching offer this refreshment she noted the consummate way for consummate was the term she privately applied in which charlotte cleared her acceptance cleared her impersonal smile of any betrayal any slightest value of consciousness and then felt the slow surge of a vision that at the end of another minute or two had floated her across the room to where her father stood looking at a picture an early florentine sacred subject that he had given her on her marriage he might have been in silence taking his last leave of it it was a work for which he entertained she knew an unqualified esteem the tenderness represented for her by his sacrifice of such a treasure had become to her sense a part of the whole infusion of the immortal expression the beauty of his sentiment looked out at her always from the beauty of the rest as if the frame made positively a window for his spiritual face she might have said to herself at this moment that in leaving the thing behind him held as in her clasping arms he was doing the most possible toward leaving her a part of his palpable self she put her hand over his shoulder and their eyes were held again together by the abiding felicity they smiled in emulation vaguely as if speech failed them through their having passed too far she would have begun to wonder the next minute if it were reserved to them for the last stage to find their contact like that of old friends reunited too much on the theory of the unchanged subject to shy lapses it s all right eh oh my dear rather he had applied the question to the great fact of the picture as she had spoken for the picture in reply but it was as if their words for an instant afterwards symbolised another truth so that they looked about at everything else to give them this extension she had passed her arm into his and the other objects in the room the other pictures the sofas the chairs the tables the cabinets the important pieces supreme in their way stood out round them consciously for recognition and applause their eyes moved together from piece to piece taking in the whole nobleness quite as if for him to measure the wisdom of old ideas the two noble persons seated in conversation at tea fell thus into the splendid effect and the general harmony mrs verver and the prince fairly placed themselves however unwittingly as high expressions of the kind of human furniture required esthetically by such a scene the fusion of their presence with the decorative elements their contribution to the triumph of selection was complete and admirable though to a lingering view a view more penetrating than the occasion really demanded they also might have figured as concrete attestations of a rare power of purchase there was much indeed in the tone in which adam verver spoke again and who shall say where his thought stopped le compte y est you ve got some good things maggie met it afresh ah don t they look well their companions at the sound of this gave them in a spacious intermission of slow talk an attention all of gravity that was like an ampler submission to the general duty of magnificence sitting as still to be thus appraised as a pair of effigies of the contemporary great on one of the platforms of madame tussaud i m so glad for your last look with which after maggie quite in the air had said it the note was struck indeed the note of that strange accepted finality of relation as from couple to couple which almost escaped an awkwardness only by not attempting a gloss yes this was the wonder that the occasion defied insistence precisely because of the vast quantities with which it dealt so that separation was on a scale beyond any compass of parting to do such an hour justice would have been in some degree to question its grounds which was why they remained in fine the four of them in the upper air united in the firmest abstention from pressure there was no point visibly at which face to face either amerigo or charlotte had pressed and how little she herself was in danger of doing so maggie scarce needed to remember that her father wouldn t by the tip of a toe of that she was equally conscious the only thing was that since he didn t she could but hold her breath for what he would do instead when at the end of three minutes more he had said with an effect of suddenness well mag and the principino it was quite as if that were by contrast the hard the truer voice she glanced at the clock i ordered him for half past five which hasn t yet struck trust him my dear not to fail you oh i don t want him to fail me was mr verver s reply yet uttered in so explicitly jocose a relation to the possibilities of failure that even when just afterwards he wandered in his impatience to one of the long windows and passed out to the balcony she asked herself but for a few seconds if reality should she follow him would overtake or meet her there she followed him of necessity it came absolutely so near to his inviting her by stepping off into temporary detachment to give the others something of the chance that she and her husband had so fantastically discussed beside him then while they hung over the great dull place clear and almost coloured now coloured with the odd sad pictured old fashioned look that empty london streets take on in waning afternoons of the summer s end she felt once more how impossible such a passage would have been to them how it would have torn them to pieces if they had so much as suffered its suppressed relations to peep out of their eyes this danger would doubtless indeed have been more to be reckoned with if the instinct of each she could certainly at least answer for her own had not so successfully acted to trump up other apparent connexions for it connexions as to which they could pretend to be frank you mustn t stay on here you know adam verver said as a result of his unobstructed outlook fawns is all there for you of course to the end of my tenure but fawns so dismantled he added with mild ruefulness fawns with half its contents and half its best things removed won t seem to you i m afraid particularly lively no maggie answered we should miss its best things its best things my dear have certainly been removed to be back there she went on to be back there and she paused for the force of her idea oh to be back there without anything good but she didn t hesitate now she brought her idea forth to be back there without charlotte is more than i think would do and as she smiled at him with it so she saw him the next instant take it take it in a way that helped her smile to pass all for an allusion to what she didn t and couldn t say this quantity was too clear that she couldn t at such an hour be pretending to name to him what it was as he would have said going to be at fawns or anywhere else to want for him that was now and in a manner exaltedly sublimely out of their compass and their question so that what was she doing while they waited for the principino while they left the others together and their tension just sensibly threatened what was she doing but just offer a bold but substantial substitute nothing was stranger moreover under the action of charlotte s presence than the fact of a felt sincerity in her words she felt her sincerity absolutely sound she gave it for all it might mean because charlotte dear you know she said is incomparable it took thirty seconds but she was to know when these were over that she had pronounced one of the happiest words of her life they had turned from the view of the street they leaned together against the balcony rail with the room largely in sight from where they stood but with the prince and mrs verver out of range nothing he could try she immediately saw was to keep his eyes from lighting not even his taking out his cigarette case and saying before he said anything else may i smoke she met it for encouragement with her my dear again and then while he struck his match she had just another minute to be nervous a minute that she made use of however not in the least to falter but to reiterate with a high ring a ring that might for all she cared reach the pair inside father father charlotte s great it was not till after he had begun to smoke that he looked at her charlotte s great they could close upon it such a basis as they might immediately feel it make and so they stood together over it quite gratefully each recording to the other s eyes that it was firm under their feet they had even thus a renewed wait as for proof of it much as if he were letting her see while the minutes lapsed for their concealed companions that this was finally just why but just why you see he presently added how right i was right i mean to do it for you ah rather she murmured with her smile and then as to be herself ideally right i don t see what you would have done without her the point was he returned quietly that i didn t see what you were to do yet it was a risk it was a risk said maggie but i believed in it at least for myself she smiled well now he smoked we see we see i know her better you know her best oh but naturally on which as the warranted truth of it hung in the air the truth warranted as who should say exactly by the present opportunity to pronounce this opportunity created and accepted she found herself lost though with a finer thrill than she had perhaps yet known in the vision of all he might mean the sense of it in her rose higher rose with each moment that he invited her thus to see him linger and when after a little more he had said smoking again and looking up with head thrown back and hands spread on the balcony rail at the grey gaunt front of the house she s beautiful beautiful her sensibility reported to her the shade of a new note it was all she might have wished for it was with a kind of speaking competence the note of possession and control and yet it conveyed to her as nothing till now had done the reality of their parting they were parting in the light of it absolutely on charlotte s value the value that was filling the room out of which they had stepped as if to give it play and with which the prince on his side was perhaps making larger acquaintance if maggie had desired at so late an hour some last conclusive comfortable category to place him in for dismissal she might have found it here in its all coming back to his ability to rest upon high values somehow when all was said and with the memory of her gifts her variety her power so much remained of charlotte s what else had she herself meant three minutes before by speaking of her as great great for the world that was before her that he proposed she should be she was not to be wasted in the application of his plan maggie held to this then that she wasn t to be wasted to let his daughter know it he had sought this brief privacy what a blessing accordingly that she could speak her joy in it his face meanwhile at all events was turned to her and as she met his eyes again her joy went straight it s success father it s success and even this he added as the principino appearing alone deep within piped across an instant greeting even this isn t altogether failure they went in to receive the boy upon whose introduction to the room by miss bogle charlotte and the prince got up seemingly with an impressiveness that had caused miss bogle not to give further effect to her own entrance she had retired but the principino s presence by itself sufficiently broke the tension the subsidence of which in the great room ten minutes later gave to the air something of the quality produced by the cessation of a sustained rattle stillness when the prince and princess returned from attending the visitors to their carriage might have been said to be not so much restored as created so that whatever next took place in it was foredoomed to remarkable salience that would have been the case even with so natural though so futile a movement as maggie s going out to the balcony again to follow with her eyes her father s departure the carriage was out of sight it had taken her too long solemnly to reascend and she looked awhile only at the great grey space on which as on the room still more the shadow of dusk had fallen here at first her husband had not rejoined her he had come up with the boy who clutching his hand abounded as usual in remarks worthy of the family archives but the two appeared then to have proceeded to report to miss bogle it meant something for the princess that her husband had thus got their son out of the way not bringing him back to his mother but everything now as she vaguely moved about struck her as meaning so much that the unheard chorus swelled yet this above all her just being there as she was and waiting for him to come in their freedom to be together there always was the meaning most disengaged she stood in the cool twilight and took in all about her where it lurked her reason for what she had done she knew at last really why and how she had been inspired and guided how she had been persistently able how to her soul all the while it had been for the sake of this end here it was then the moment the golden fruit that had shone from afar only what were these things in the fact for the hand and for the lips when tested when tasted what were they as a reward closer than she had ever been to the measure of her course and the full face of her act she had an instant of the terror that when there has been suspense always precedes on the part of the creature to be paid the certification of the amount amerigo knew it the amount he still held it and the delay in his return making her heart beat too fast to go on was like a sudden blinding light on a wild speculation she had thrown the dice but his hand was over her cast he opened the door however at last he hadn t been away ten minutes and then with her sight of him renewed to intensity she seemed to have a view of the number his presence alone as he paused to look at her somehow made it the highest and even before he had spoken she had begun to be paid in full with that consciousness in fact an extraordinary thing occurred the assurance of her safety so making her terror drop that already within the minute it had been changed to concern for his own anxiety for everything that was deep in his being and everything that was fair in his face so far as seeing that she was paid went he might have been holding out the money bag for her to come and take it but what instantly rose for her between the act and her acceptance was the sense that she must strike him as waiting for a confession this in turn charged her with a new horror if that was her proper payment she would go without money his acknowledgment hung there too monstrously at the expense of charlotte before whose mastery of the greater style she had just been standing dazzled all she now knew accordingly was that she should be ashamed to listen to the uttered word all that is but that she might dispose of it on the spot forever isn t she too splendid she simply said offering it to explain and to finish oh splendid with which he came over to her that s our help you see she added to point further her moral it kept him before her therefore taking in or trying to what she so wonderfully gave he tried too clearly to please her to meet her in her own way but with the result only that close to her her face kept before him his hands holding her shoulders his whole act enclosing her he presently echoed see i see nothing but you and the truth of it had with this force after a moment so strangely lighted his eyes that as for pity and dread of them she buried her own in his breast glasses by henry james chapter i yes indeed i say to myself pen in hand i can keep hold of the thread and let it lead me back to the first impression the little story is all there i can touch it from point to point for the thread as i call it is a row of coloured beads on a string none of the beads are missing at least i think they re not that s exactly what i shall amuse myself with finding out i had been all summer working hard in town and then had gone down to folkestone for a blow art was long i felt and my holiday short my mother was settled at folkestone and i paid her a visit when i could i remember how on this occasion after weeks in my stuffy studio with my nose on my palette i sniffed up the clean salt air and cooled my eyes with the purple sea the place was full of lodgings and the lodgings were at that season full of people people who had nothing to do but to stare at one another on the great flat down there were thousands of little chairs and almost as many little jews and there was music in an open rotunda over which the little jews wagged their big noses we all strolled to and fro and took pennyworths of rest the long level cliff top edged in places with its iron rail might have been the deck of a huge crowded ship there were old folks in bath chairs and there was one dear chair creeping to its last full stop by the side of which i always walked there was in fine weather the coast of france to look at and there were the usual things to say about it there was also in every state of the atmosphere our friend mrs meldrum a subject of remark not less inveterate the widow of an officer in the engineers she had settled like many members of the martial miscellany well within sight of the hereditary enemy who however had left her leisure to form in spite of the difference of their years a close alliance with my mother she was the heartiest the keenest the ugliest of women the least apologetic the least morbid in her misfortune she carried it high aloft with loud sounds and free gestures made it flutter in the breeze as if it had been the flag of her country it consisted mainly of a big red face indescribably out of drawing from which she glared at you through gold rimmed aids to vision optic circles of such diameter and so frequently displaced that some one had vividly spoken of her as flattering her nose against the glass of her spectacles she was extraordinarily near sighted and whatever they did to other objects they magnified immensely the kind eyes behind them blest conveniences they were in their hideous honest strength they showed the good lady everything in the world but her own queerness this element was enhanced by wild braveries of dress reckless charges of colour and stubborn resistances of cut wondrous encounters in which the art of the toilet seemed to lay down its life she had the tread of a grenadier and the voice of an angel in the course of a walk with her the day after my arrival i found myself grabbing her arm with sudden and undue familiarity i had been struck by the beauty of a face that approached us and i was still more affected when i saw the face at the sight of my companion open like a window thrown wide a smile fluttered out of it an brightly as a drapery dropped from a sill a drapery shaken there in the sun by a young lady flanked by two young men a wonderful young lady who as we drew nearer rushed up to mrs meldrum with arms flourished for an embrace my immediate impression of her had been that she was dressed in mourning but during the few moments she stood talking with our friend i made more discoveries the figure from the neck down was meagre the stature insignificant but the desire to please towered high as well as the air of infallibly knowing how and of never never missing it this was a little person whom i would have made a high bid for a good chance to paint the head the features the colour the whole facial oval and radiance had a wonderful purity the deep grey eyes the most agreeable i thought that i had ever seen brushed with a kind of winglike grace every object they encountered their possessor was just back from boulogne where she had spent a week with dear mrs floyd taylor this accounted for the effusiveness of her reunion with dear mrs meldrum her black garments were of the freshest and daintiest she suggested a pink and white wreath at a showy funeral she confounded us for three minutes with her presence she was a beauty of the great conscious public responsible order the young men her companions gazed at her and grinned i could see there were very few moments of the day at which young men these or others would not be so occupied the people who approached took leave of their manners every one seemed to linger and gape when she brought her face close to mrs meldrum s and she appeared to be always bringing it close to somebody s it was a marvel that objects so dissimilar should express the same general identity the unmistakable character of the english gentlewoman mrs meldrum sustained the comparison with her usual courage but i wondered why she didn t introduce me i should have had no objection to the bringing of such a face close to mine however by the time the young lady moved on with her escort she herself bequeathed me a sense that some such rapprochement might still occur was this by reason of the general frequency of encounters at folkestone or by reason of a subtle acknowledgment that she contrived to make of the rights on the part of others that such beauty as hers created i was in a position to answer that question after mrs meldrum had answered a few of mine chapter ii flora saunt the only daughter of an old soldier had lost both her parents her mother within a few months mrs meldrum had known them disapproved of them considerably avoided them she had watched the girl off and on from her early childhood flora just twenty was extraordinarily alone in the world so alone that she had no natural chaperon no one to stay with but a mercenary stranger mrs hammond synge the sister in law of one of the young men i had just seen she had lots of friends but none of them nice she kept picking up impossible people the floyd taylors with whom she had been at boulogne were simply horrid the hammond synges were perhaps not so vulgar but they had no conscience in their dealings with her she knows what i think of them said mrs meldrum and indeed she knows what i think of most things she shares that privilege with most of your friends i replied laughing no doubt but possibly to some of my friends it makes a little difference that girl doesn t care a button she knows best of all what i think of flora saunt and what may your opinion be why that she s not worth troubling about an idiot too abysmal doesn t she care for that just enough as you saw to hug me till i cry out she s too pleased with herself for anything else to matter surely my dear friend i rejoined she has a good deal to be pleased with so every one tells her and so you would have told her if i had given you the chance however that doesn t signify either for her vanity is beyond all making or mending she believes in herself and she s welcome after all poor dear having only herself to look to i ve seldom met a young woman more completely free to be silly she has a clear course she ll make a showy finish well i replied as she probably will reduce many persons to the same degraded state her partaking of it won t stand out so much if you mean that the world s full of twaddlers i quite agree with you cried mrs meldrum trumpeting her laugh half across the channel i had after this to consider a little what she would call my mother s son but i didn t let it prevent me from insisting on her making me acquainted with flora saunt indeed i took the bull by the horns urging that she had drawn the portrait of a nature which common charity now demanded of her to put into relation with a character really fine such a frail creature was just an object of pity this contention on my part had at first of course been jocular but strange to say it was quite the ground i found myself taking with regard to our young lady after i had begun to know her i couldn t have said what i felt about her except that she was undefended from the first of my sitting with her there after dinner under the stars that was a week at folkestone of balmy nights and muffled tides and crowded chairs i became aware both that protection was wholly absent from her life and that she was wholly indifferent to its absence the odd thing was that she was not appealing she was abjectly divinely conceited absurdly fantastically pleased her beauty was as yet all the world to her a world she had plenty to do to live in mrs meldrum told me more about her and there was nothing that as the centre of a group of giggling nudging spectators flora wasn t ready to tell about herself she held her little court in the crowd upon the grass playing her light over jews and gentiles completely at ease in all promiscuities it was an effect of these things that from the very first with every one listening i could mention that my main business with her would be just to have a go at her head and to arrange in that view for an early sitting it would have been as impossible i think to be impertinent to her as it would have been to throw a stone at a plate glass window so any talk that went forward on the basis of her loveliness was the most natural thing in the world and immediately became the most general and sociable it was when i saw all this that i judged how though it was the last thing she asked for what one would ever most have at her service was a curious compassion that sentiment was coloured by the vision of the dire exposure of a being whom vanity had put so off her guard hers was the only vanity i have ever known that made its possessor superlatively soft mrs meldrum s further information contributed moreover to these indulgences her account of the girl s neglected childhood and queer continental relegations with straying squabbling monte carlo haunting parents the more invidious picture above all of her pecuniary arrangement still in force with the hammond synges who really though they never took her out practically she went out alone had their hands half the time in her pocket she had to pay for everything down to her share of the wine bills and the horses fodder down to bertie hammond synge s fare in the underground when he went to the city for her she had been left with just money enough to turn her head and it hadn t even been put in trust nothing prudent or proper had been done with it she could spend her capital and at the rate she was going expensive extravagant and with a swarm of parasites to help it certainly wouldn t last very long couldn t you perhaps take her independent unencumbered as you are i asked of mrs meldrum you re probably with one exception the sanest person she knows and you at least wouldn t scandalously fleece her how do you know what i wouldn t do my humorous friend demanded of course i ve thought how i can help her it has kept me awake at night but doing it s impossible she ll take nothing from me you know what she does she hugs me and runs away she has an instinct about me and feels that i ve one about her and then she dislikes me for another reason that i m not quite clear about but that i m well aware of and that i shall find out some day so far as her settling with me goes it would be impossible moreover here she wants naturally enough a much wider field she must live in london her game is there so she takes the line of adoring me of saying she can never forget that i was devoted to her mother which i wouldn t for the world have been and of giving me a wide berth i think she positively dislikes to look at me it s all right there s no obligation though people in general can t take their eyes off me i see that at this moment i replied but what does it matter where or how for the present she lives she ll marry infallibly marry early and everything then will change whom will she marry my companion gloomily asked any one she likes she s so abnormally pretty that she can do anything she ll fascinate some nabob or some prince she ll fascinate him first and bore him afterwards moreover she s not so pretty as you make her out she hasn t a scrap of a figure no doubt but one doesn t in the least miss it not now said mrs meldrum but one will when she s older and when everything will have to count when she s older she ll count as a princess so it won t matter she has other drawbacks my companion went on those wonderful eyes are good for nothing but to roll about like sugar balls which they greatly resemble in a child s mouth she can t use them use them why she does nothing else to make fools of young men but not to read or write not to do any sort of work she never opens a book and her maid writes her notes you ll say that those who live in glass houses shouldn t throw stones of course i know that if i didn t wear my goggles i shouldn t be good for much do you mean that miss saunt ought to sport such things i exclaimed with more horror than i meant to show i don t prescribe for her i don t know that they re what she requires what s the matter with her eyes i asked after a moment i don t exactly know but i heard from her mother years ago that even as a child they had had for a while to put her into spectacles and that though she hated them and had been in a fury of disgust she would always have to be extremely careful i m sure i hope she is i echoed the hope but i remember well the impression this made upon me my immediate pang of resentment a disgust almost equal to flora s own i felt as if a great rare sapphire had split in my hand chapter iii this conversation occurred the night before i went back to town i settled on the morrow to take a late train so that i had still my morning to spend at folkestone where during the greater part of it i was out with my mother every one in the place was as usual out with some one else and even had i been free to go and take leave of her i should have been sure that flora saunt would not be at home just where she was i presently discovered she was at the far end of the cliff the point at which it overhangs the pretty view of sandgate and hythe her back however was turned to this attraction it rested with the aid of her elbows thrust slightly behind her so that her scanty little shoulders were raised toward her ears on the high rail that inclosed the down two gentlemen stood before her whose faces we couldn t see but who even as observed from the rear were visibly absorbed in the charming figure piece submitted to them i was freshly struck with the fact that this meagre and defective little person with the cock of her hat and the flutter of her crape with her eternal idleness her eternal happiness her absence of moods and mysteries and the pretty presentation of her feet which especially now in the supported slope of her posture occupied with their imperceptibility so much of the foreground i was reminded anew i say how our young lady dazzled by some art that the enumeration of her merits didn t explain and that the mention of her lapses didn t affect where she was amiss nothing counted and where she was right everything did i say she was wanting in mystery but that after all was her secret this happened to be my first chance of introducing her to my mother who had not much left in life but the quiet look from under the hood of her chair at the things which when she should have quitted those she loved she could still trust to make the world good for them i wondered an instant how much she might be moved to trust flora saunt and then while the chair stood still and she waited i went over and asked the girl to come and speak to her in this way i saw that if one of flora s attendants was the inevitable young hammond synge master of ceremonies of her regular court always offering the use of a telescope and accepting that of a cigar the other was a personage i had not yet encountered a small pale youth in showy knickerbockers whose eyebrows and nose and the glued points of whose little moustache were extraordinarily uplifted and sustained i remember taking him at first for a foreigner and for something of a pretender i scarce know why unless because of the motive i felt in the stare he fixed on me when i asked miss saunt to come away he struck me a little as a young man practising the social art of impertinence but it didn t matter for flora came away with alacrity bringing all her prettiness and pleasure and gliding over the grass in that rustle of delicate mourning which made the endless variety of her garments as a painter could take heed strike one always as the same obscure elegance she seated herself on the floor of my mother s chair a little too much on her right instep as i afterwards gathered caressing her still hand smiling up into her cold face commending and approving her without a reserve and without a doubt she told her immediately as if it were something for her to hold on by that she was soon to sit to me for a likeness and these words gave me a chance to enquire if it would be the fate of the picture should i finish it to be presented to the young man in the knickerbockers her lips at this parted in a stare her eyes darkened to the purple of one of the shadow patches on the sea she showed for the passing instant the face of some splendid tragic mask and i remembered for the inconsequence of it what mrs meldrum had said about her sight i had derived from this lady a worrying impulse to catechise her but that didn t seem exactly kind so i substituted another question inquiring who the pretty young man in knickerbockers might happen to be oh a gentleman i met at boulogne he has come over to see me after a moment she added lord iffield i had never heard of lord iffield but her mention of his having been at boulogne helped me to give him a niche mrs meldrum had incidentally thrown a certain light on the manners of mrs floyd taylor flora s recent hostess in that charming town a lady who it appeared had a special vocation for helping rich young men to find a use for their leisure she had always one or other in hand and had apparently on this occasion pointed her lesson at the rare creature on the opposite coast i had a vague idea that boulogne was not a resort of the world s envied at the same time there might very well have been a strong attraction there even for one of the darlings of fortune i could perfectly understand in any case that such a darling should be drawn to folkestone by flora saunt but it was not in truth of these things i was thinking what was uppermost in my mind was a matter which though it had no sort of keeping insisted just then on coming out is it true miss saunt i suddenly demanded that you re so unfortunate as to have had some warning about your beautiful eyes i was startled by the effect of my words the girl threw back her head changing colour from brow to chin true who in the world says so i repented of my question in a flash the way she met it made it seem cruel and i felt my mother look at me in some surprise i took care in answer to flora s challenge not to incriminate mrs meldrum i answered that the rumour had reached me only in the vaguest form and that if i had been moved to put it to the test my very real interest in her must be held responsible her blush died away but a pair of still prettier tears glistened in its track if you ever hear such a thing said again you can say it s a horrid lie i had brought on a commotion deeper than any i was prepared for but it was explained in some degree by the next words she uttered i m happy to say there s nothing the matter with any part of me whatever not the least little thing she spoke with her habitual complacency with triumphant assurance she smiled again and i could see how she wished that she hadn t so taken me up she turned it off with a laugh i ve good eyes good teeth a good digestion and a good temper i m sound of wind and limb nothing could have been more characteristic than her blush and her tears nothing less acceptable to her than to be thought not perfect in every particular she couldn t submit to the imputation of a flaw i expressed my delight in what she told me assuring her i should always do battle for her and as if to rejoin her companions she got up from her place on my mother s toes the young men presented their backs to us they were leaning on the rail of the cliff our incident had produced a certain awkwardness and while i was thinking of what next to say she exclaimed irrelevantly don t you know he ll be lord considine at that moment the youth marked for this high destiny turned round and she spoke to my mother i ll introduce him to you he s awfully nice she beckoned and invited him with her parasol the movement struck me as taking everything for granted i had heard of lord considine and if i had not been able to place lord iffield it was because i didn t know the name of his eldest son the young man took no notice of miss saunt s appeal he only stared a moment and then on her repeating it quietly turned his back she was an odd creature she didn t blush at this she only said to my mother apologetically but with the frankest sweetest amusement you don t mind do you he s a monster of shyness it was as if she were sorry for every one for lord iffield the victim of a complaint so painful and for my mother the subject of a certain slight i m sure i don t want him said my mother but flora added some promise of how she would handle him for his rudeness she would clearly never explain anything by any failure of her own appeal there rolled over me while she took leave of us and floated back to her friends a wave of superstitious dread i seemed somehow to see her go forth to her fate and yet what should fill out this orb of a high destiny if not such beauty and such joy i had a dim idea that lord considine was a great proprietor and though there mingled with it a faint impression that i shouldn t like his son the result of the two images was a whimsical prayer that the girl mightn t miss her possible fortune chapter iv one day in the course of the following june there was ushered into my studio a gentleman whom i had not yet seen but with whom i had been very briefly in correspondence a letter from him had expressed to me some days before his regret on learning that my splendid portrait of miss flora louisa saunt whose full name figured by her own wish in the catalogue of the exhibition of the academy had found a purchaser before the close of the private view he took the liberty of inquiring whether i might have at his service some other memorial of the same lovely head some preliminary sketch some study for the picture i had replied that i had indeed painted miss saunt more than once and that if he were interested in my work i should be happy to show him what i had done mr geoffrey dawling the person thus introduced to me stumbled into my room with awkward movements and equivocal sounds a long lean confused confusing young man with a bad complexion and large protrusive teeth he bore in its most indelible pressure the postmark as it were of oxford and as soon as he opened his mouth i perceived in addition to a remarkable revelation of gums that the text of the queer communication matched the registered envelope he was full of refinements and angles of dreary and distinguished knowledge of his unconscious drollery his dress freely partook it seemed from the gold ring into which his red necktie was passed to the square toe caps of his boots to conform with a high sense of modernness to the fashion before the last there were moments when his overdone urbanity all suggestive stammers and interrogative quavers made him scarcely intelligible but i felt him to be a gentleman and i liked the honesty of his errand and the expression of his good green eyes as a worshipper at the shrine of beauty however he needed explaining especially when i found he had no acquaintance with my brilliant model had on the mere evidence of my picture taken as he said a tremendous fancy to her looks i ought doubtless to have been humiliated by the simplicity of his judgment of them a judgment for which the rendering was lost in the subject quite leaving out the element of art he was like the innocent reader for whom the story is really true and the author a negligible quantity he had come to me only because he wanted to purchase and i remember being so amused at his attitude which i had never seen equally marked in a person of education that i asked him why for the sort of enjoyment he desired it wouldn t be more to the point to deal directly with the lady he stared and blushed at this the idea clearly alarmed him he was an extraordinary case personally so modest that i could see it had never occurred to him he had fallen in love with a painted sign and seemed content just to dream of what it stood for he was the young prince in the legend or the comedy who loses his heart to the miniature of the princess beyond seas until i knew him better this puzzled me much the link was so missing between his sensibility and his type he was of course bewildered by my sketches which implied in the beholder some sense of intention and quality but for one of them a comparative failure he ended by conceiving a preference so arbitrary and so lively that taking no second look at the others he expressed his wish to possess it and fell into the extremity of confusion over the question of price i helped him over that stile and he went off without having asked me a direct question about miss saunt yet with his acquisition under his arm his delicacy was such that he evidently considered his rights to be limited he had acquired none at all in regard to the original of the picture there were others for i was curious about him that i wanted him to feel i conceded i should have been glad of his carrying away a sense of ground acquired for coming back to ensure this i had probably only to invite him and i perfectly recall the impulse that made me forbear it operated suddenly from within while he hung about the door and in spite of the diffident appeal that blinked in his gentle grin if he was smitten with flora s ghost what mightn t be the direct force of the luminary that could cast such a shadow this source of radiance flooding my poor place might very well happen to be present the next time he should turn up the idea was sharp within me that there were relations and complications it was no mission of mine to bring about if they were to develop they should develop in their very own sense let me say at once that they did develop and that i perhaps after all had something to do with it if mr dawling had departed without a fresh appointment he was to reappear six months later under protection no less powerful than that of our young lady herself i had seen her repeatedly for months she had grown to regard my studio as the temple of her beauty this miracle was recorded and celebrated there as nowhere else in other places there was occasional reference to other subjects of remark the degree of her presumption continued to be stupefying there was nothing so extraordinary save the degree in which she never paid for it she was kept innocent that is she was kept safe by her egotism but she was helped also though she had now put off her mourning by the attitude of the lone orphan who had to be a law unto herself it was as a lone orphan that she came and went as a lone orphan that she was the centre of a crush the neglect of the hammond synges gave relief to this character and she made it worth their while to be as every one said too shocking lord iffield had gone to india to shoot tigers but he returned in time for the punctual private view it was he who had snapped up as flora called it the gem of the exhibition my hope for the girl s future had slipped ignominiously off his back but after his purchase of the portrait i tried to cultivate a new faith the girl s own faith was wonderful it couldn t however be contagious too great was the limit of her sense of what painters call values her colours were laid on like blankets on a cold night how indeed could a person speak the truth who was always posturing and bragging she was after all vulgar enough and by the time i had mastered her profile and could almost with my eyes shut do it in a single line i was decidedly tired of its purity which affected me at last as inane one moved with her moreover among phenomena mismated and unrelated nothing in her talk ever matched anything out of it lord iffield was dying of love for her but his family was leading him a life his mother horrid woman had told some one that she would rather he should be swallowed by a tiger than marry a girl not absolutely one of themselves he had given his young friend unmistakable signs but was lying low gaining time it was in his father s power to be both in personal and in pecuniary ways excessively nasty to him his father wouldn t last for ever quite the contrary and he knew how thoroughly in spite of her youth her beauty and the swarm of her admirers some of them positively threatening in their passion he could trust her to hold out there were richer cleverer men there were greater personages too but she liked her little viscount just as he was and liked to think that bullied and persecuted he had her there so gratefully to rest upon she came back to me with tale upon tale and it all might be or mightn t i never met my pretty model in the world she moved it appeared in exalted circles and could only admire in her wealth of illustration the grandeur of her life and the freedom of her hand i had on the first opportunity spoken to her of geoffrey dawling and she had listened to my story so far as she had the art of such patience asking me indeed more questions about him than i could answer then she had capped my anecdote with others much more striking the disclosure of effects produced in the most extraordinary quarters on people who had followed her into railway carriages guards and porters even who had literally stuck there others who had spoken to her in shops and hung about her house door cabmen upon her honour in london who to gaze their fill at her had found excuses to thrust their petrifaction through the very glasses of four wheelers she lost herself in these reminiscences the moral of which was that poor mr dawling was only one of a million when therefore the next autumn she flourished into my studio with her odd companion at her heels her first care was to make clear to me that if he was now in servitude it wasn t because she had run after him dawling explained with a hundred grins that when one wished very much to get anything one usually ended by doing so a proposition which led me wholly to dissent and our young lady to asseverate that she hadn t in the least wished to get mr dawling she mightn t have wished to get him but she wished to show him and i seemed to read that if she could treat him as a trophy her affairs were rather at the ebb true there always hung from her belt a promiscuous fringe of scalps much at any rate would have come and gone since our separation in july she had spent four months abroad where on swiss and italian lakes in german cities in the french capital many accidents might have happened chapter v i had been again with my mother but except mrs meldrum and the gleam of france had not found at folkestone my old resources and pastimes mrs meldrum much edified by my report of the performances as she called them in my studio had told me that to her knowledge flora would soon be on the straw she had cut from her capital such fine fat slices that there was almost nothing more left to swallow perched on her breezy cliff the good lady dazzled me as usual by her universal light she knew so much more about everything and everybody than i could ever squeeze out of my colour tubes she knew that flora was acting on system and absolutely declined to be interfered with her precious reasoning was that her money would last as long as she should need it that a magnificent marriage would crown her charms before she should be really pinched she had a sum put by for a liberal outfit meanwhile the proper use of the rest was to decorate her for the approaches to the altar keep her afloat in the society in which she would most naturally meet her match lord iffield had been seen with her at lucerne at cadenabbia but it was mrs meldrum s conviction that nothing was to be expected of him but the most futile flirtation the girl had a certain hold of him but with a great deal of swagger he hadn t the spirit of a sheep he was in fear of his father and would never commit himself in lord considine s lifetime the most flora might achieve was that he wouldn t marry some one else geoffrey dawling to mrs meldrum s knowledge i had told her of the young man s visit had attached himself on the way back from italy to the hammond synge group my informant was in a position to be definite about this dangler she knew about his people she had heard of him before hadn t he been a friend of one of her nephews at oxford hadn t he spent the christmas holidays precisely three years before at her brother in law s in yorkshire taking that occasion to get himself refused with derision by wilful betty the second daughter of the house her sister who liked the floundering youth had written to her to complain of betty and that the young man should now turn up as an appendage of flora s was one of those oft cited proofs that the world is small and that there are not enough people to go round his father had been something or other in the treasury his grandfather on the mother s side had been something or other in the church he had come into the paternal estate two or three thousand a year in hampshire but he had let the place advantageously and was generous to four plain sisters who lived at bournemouth and adored him the family was hideous all round but the very salt of the earth he was supposed to be unspeakably clever he was fond of london fond of books of intellectual society and of the idea of a political career that such a man should be at the same time fond of flora saunt attested as the phrase in the first volume of gibbon has it the variety of his inclinations i was soon to learn that he was fonder of her than of all the other things together betty one of five and with views above her station was at any rate felt at home to have dished herself by her perversity of course no one had looked at her since and no one would ever look at her again it would be eminently desirable that flora should learn the lesson of betty s fate i was not struck i confess with all this in my mind by any symptom on our young lady s part of that sort of meditation the one moral she saw in anything was that of her incomparable aspect which mr dawling smitten even like the railway porters and the cabmen by the doom dealing gods had followed from london to venice and from venice back to london again i afterwards learned that her version of this episode was profusely inexact his personal acquaintance with her had been determined by an accident remarkable enough i admit in connexion with what had gone before a coincidence at all events superficially striking at munich returning from a tour in the tyrol with two of his sisters he had found himself at the table d hote of his inn opposite to the full presentment of that face of which the mere clumsy copy had made him dream and desire he had been tossed by it to a height so vertiginous as to involve a retreat from the board but the next day he had dropped with a resounding thud at the very feet of his apparition on the following with an equal incoherence a sacrifice even of his bewildered sisters whom he left behind he made an heroic effort to escape by flight from a fate of which he had already felt the cold breath that fate in london very little later drove him straight before it drove him one sunday afternoon in the rain to the door of the hammond synges he marched in other words close up to the cannon that was to blow him to pieces but three weeks when he reappeared to me had elapsed since then yet to vary my metaphor the burden he was to carry for the rest of his days was firmly lashed to his back i don t mean by this that flora had been persuaded to contract her scope i mean that he had been treated to the unconditional snub which as the event was to show couldn t have been bettered as a means of securing him she hadn t calculated but she had said never and that word had made a bed big enough for his long legged patience he became from this moment to my mind the interesting figure in the piece now that he had acted without my aid i was free to show him this and having on his own side something to show me he repeatedly knocked at my door what he brought with him on these occasions was a simplicity so huge that as i turn my ear to the past i seem even now to hear it bumping up and down my stairs that was really what i saw of him in the light of his behaviour he had fallen in love as he might have broken his leg and the fracture was of a sort that would make him permanently lame it was the whole man who limped and lurched with nothing of him left in the same position as before the tremendous cleverness the literary society the political ambition the bournemouth sisters all seemed to flop with his every movement a little nearer to the floor i hadn t had an oxford training and i had never encountered the great man at whose feet poor dawling had most submissively sat and who had addressed him his most destructive sniffs but i remember asking myself how effectively this privilege had supposed itself to prepare him for the career on which my friend appeared now to have embarked i remember too making up my mind about the cleverness which had its uses and i suppose in impenetrable shades even its critics but from which the friction of mere personal intercourse was not the sort of process to extract a revealing spark he accepted without a question both his fever and his chill and the only thing he touched with judgment was this convenience of my friendship he doubtless told me his simple story but the matter comes back in a kind of sense of my being rather the mouthpiece of my having had to put it together for him he took it from me in this form without a groan and i gave it him quite as it came he took it again and again spending his odd half hours with me as if for the very purpose of learning how idiotically he was in love he told me i made him see things to begin with hadn t i first made him see flora saunt i wanted him to give her up and lucidly informed him why on which he never protested nor contradicted never was even so alembicated as to declare just for the sake of the point that he wouldn t he simply and pointlessly didn t and when at the end of three months i asked him what was the use of talking with such a fellow his nearest approach to a justification was to say that what made him want to help her was just the deficiencies i dwelt on i could only reply without gross developments oh if you re as sorry for her as that i too was nearly as sorry for her as that but it only led me to be sorrier still for other victims of this compassion with dawling as with me the compassion was at first in excess of any visible motive so that when eventually the motive was supplied each could to a certain extent compliment the other on the fineness of his foresight after he had begun to haunt my studio miss saunt quite gave it up and i finally learned that she accused me of conspiring with him to put pressure on her to marry him she didn t know i would take it that way else she would never have brought him to see me it was in her view a part of the conspiracy that to show him a kindness i asked him at last to sit to me i dare say moreover she was disgusted to hear that i had ended by attempting almost as many sketches of his beauty as i had attempted of hers what was the value of tributes to beauty by a hand that could so abase itself my relation to poor dawling s want of modelling was simple enough i was really digging in that sandy desert for the buried treasure of his soul chapter vi it befell at this period just before christmas that on my having gone under pressure of the season into a great shop to buy a toy or two my eyes fleeing from superfluity lighted at a distance on the bright concretion of flora saunt an exhibitability that held its own even against the most plausible pinkness of the most developed dolls a huge quarter of the place the biggest bazaar on earth was peopled with these and other effigies and fantasies as well as with purchasers and vendors haggard alike in the blaze of the gas with hesitations i was just about to appeal to flora to avert that stage of my errand when i saw that she was accompanied by a gentleman whose identity though more than a year had elapsed came back to me from the folkestone cliff it had been associated on that scene with showy knickerbockers at present it overflowed more splendidly into a fur trimmed overcoat lord iffield s presence made me waver an instant before crossing over and during that instant flora blank and undistinguishing as if she too were after all weary of alternatives looked straight across at me i was on the point of raising my hat to her when i observed that her face gave no sign i was exactly in the line of her vision but she either didn t see me or didn t recognise me or else had a reason to pretend she didn t was her reason that i had displeased her and that she wished to punish me i had always thought it one of her merits that she wasn t vindictive she at any rate simply looked away and at this moment one of the shop girls who had apparently gone off in search of it bustled up to her with a small mechanical toy it so happened that i followed closely what then took place afterwards recognising that i had been led to do so led even through the crowd to press nearer for the purpose by an impression of which in the act i was not fully conscious flora with the toy in her hand looked round at her companion then seeing his attention had been solicited in another quarter she moved away with the shop girl who had evidently offered to conduct her into the presence of more objects of the same sort when she reached the indicated spot i was in a position still to observe her she had asked some question about the working of the toy and the girl taking it herself began to explain the little secret flora bent her head over it but she clearly didn t understand i saw her in a manner that quickened my curiosity give a glance back at the place from which she had come lord iffield was talking with another young person she satisfied herself of this by the aid of a question addressed to her own attendant she then drew closer to the table near which she stood and turning her back to me bent her head lower over the collection of toys and more particularly over the small object the girl had attempted to explain she took it again and after a moment with her face well averted made an odd motion of her arms and a significant little duck of her head these slight signs singular as it may appear produced in my bosom an agitation so great that i failed to notice lord iffield s whereabouts he had rejoined her he was close upon her before i knew it or before she knew it herself i felt at that instant the strangest of all promptings if it could have operated more rapidly it would have caused me to dash between them in some such manner as to give flora a caution in fact as it was i think i could have done this in time had i not been checked by a curiosity stronger still than my impulse there were three seconds during which i saw the young man and yet let him come on didn t i make the quick calculation that if he didn t catch what flora was doing i too might perhaps not catch it she at any rate herself took the alarm on perceiving her companion s nearness she made still averted another duck of her head and a shuffle of her hands so precipitate that a little tin steamboat she had been holding escaped from them and rattled down to the floor with a sharpness that i hear at this hour lord iffield had already seized her arm with a violent jerk he brought her round toward him then it was that there met my eyes a quite distressing sight this exquisite creature blushing glaring exposed with a pair of big black rimmed eye glasses defacing her by their position crookedly astride of her beautiful nose she made a grab at them with her free hand while i turned confusedly away chapter vii i don t remember how soon it was i spoke to geoffrey dawling his sittings were irregular but it was certainly the very next time he gave me one has any rumour ever reached you of miss saunt s having anything the matter with her eyes he stared with a candour that was a sufficient answer to my question backing it up with a shocked and mystified never then i asked him if he had observed in her any symptom however disguised of embarrassed sight on which after a moment s thought he exclaimed disguised as if my use of that word had vaguely awakened a train she s not a bit myopic he said she doesn t blink or contract her lids i fully recognised this and i mentioned that she altogether denied the impeachment owing it to him moreover to explain the ground of my inquiry i gave him a sketch of the incident that had taken place before me at the shop he knew all about lord iffield that nobleman had figured freely in our conversation as his preferred his injurious rival poor dawling s contention was that if there had been a definite engagement between his lordship and the young lady the sort of thing that was announced in the morning post renunciation and retirement would be comparatively easy to him but that having waited in vain for any such assurance he was entitled to act as if the door were not really closed or were at any rate not cruelly locked he was naturally much struck with my anecdote and still more with my interpretation of it there is something there is something possibly something very grave certainly something that requires she should make use of artificial aids she won t admit it publicly because with her idolatry of her beauty the feeling she is all made up of she sees in such aids nothing but the humiliation and the disfigurement she has used them in secret but that is evidently not enough for the affection she suffers from apparently some definite menace has lately grown much worse she looked straight at me in the shop which was violently lighted without seeing it was i at the same distance at folkestone where as you know i first met her where i heard this mystery hinted at and where she indignantly denied the thing she appeared easily enough to recognise people at present she couldn t really make out anything the shop girl showed her she has successfully concealed from the man i saw her with that she resorts in private to a pince nez and that she does so not only under the strictest orders from her oculist but because literally the poor thing can t accomplish without such help half the business of life iffield however has suspected something and his suspicions whether expressed or kept to himself have put him on the watch i happened to have a glimpse of the movement at which he pounced on her and caught her in the act i had thought it all out my idea explained many things and dawling turned pale as he listened to me was he rough with her he anxiously asked how can i tell what passed between them i fled from the place my companion stared do you mean to say her eyesight s going heaven forbid in that case how could she take life as she does how does she take life that s the question he sat there bewilderedly brooding the tears rose to his lids they reminded me of those i had seen in flora s the day i risked my enquiry the question he had asked was one that to my own satisfaction i was ready to answer but i hesitated to let him hear as yet all that my reflections had suggested i was indeed privately astonished at their ingenuity for the present i only rejoined that it struck me she was playing a particular game at which he went on as if he hadn t heard me suddenly haunted with a fear lost in the dark possibility do you mean there s a danger of anything very bad my dear fellow you must ask her special adviser who in the world is her special adviser i haven t a conception but we mustn t get too excited my impression would be that she has only to observe a few ordinary rules to exercise a little common sense dawling jumped at this i see to stick to the pince nez to follow to the letter her oculist s prescription whatever it is and at whatever cost to her prettiness it s not a thing to be trifled with upon my honour it shan t be he roundly declared and he adjusted himself to his position again as if we had quite settled the business after a considerable interval while i botched away he suddenly said did they make a great difference a great difference those things she had put on oh the glasses in her beauty she looked queer of course but it was partly because one was unaccustomed there are women who look charming in nippers what at any rate if she does look queer she must be mad not to accept that alternative she is mad said geoffrey dawling mad to refuse you i grant besides i went on the pince nez which was a large and peculiar one was all awry she had half pulled it off but it continued to stick and she was crimson she was angry it must have been horrible my companion groaned it was horrible but it s still more horrible to defy all warnings it s still more horrible to be landed in without saying in what i disgustedly shrugged my shoulders after a glance at me dawling jerked round then you do believe that she may be i hesitated the thing would be to make her believe it she only needs a good scare but if that fellow is shocked at the precautions she does take oh who knows i rejoined with small sincerity i don t suppose iffield is absolutely a brute i would take her with leather blinders like a shying mare cried geoffrey dawling i had an impression that iffield wouldn t but i didn t communicate it for i wanted to pacify my friend whom i had discomposed too much for the purposes of my sitting i recollect that i did some good work that morning but it also comes back to me that before we separated he had practically revealed to me that my anecdote connecting itself in his mind with a series of observations at the time unconscious and unregistered had covered with light the subject of our colloquy he had had a formless perception of some secret that drove miss saunt to subterfuges and the more he thought of it the more he guessed this secret to be the practice of making believe she saw when she didn t and of cleverly keeping people from finding out how little she saw when one pieced things together it was astonishing what ground they covered just as he was going away he asked me from what source at folkestone the horrid tale had proceeded when i had given him as i saw no reason not to do the name of mrs meldrum he exclaimed oh i know all about her she s a friend of some friends of mine at this i remembered wilful betty and said to myself that i knew some one who would probably prove more wilful still chapter viii a few days later i again heard dawling on my stairs and even before he passed my threshold i knew he had something to tell i ve been down to folkestone it was necessary i should see her i forget whether he had come straight from the station he was at any rate out of breath with his news which it took me however a minute to apply you mean that you ve been with mrs meldrum yes to ask her what she knows and how she comes to know it it worked upon me awfully i mean what you told me he made a visible effort to seem quieter than he was and it showed me sufficiently that he had not been reassured i laid to comfort him and smiling at a venture a friendly hand on his arm and he dropped into my eyes fixing them an instant a strange distended look which might have expressed the cold clearness of all that was to come i know now he said with an emphasis he rarely used what then did mrs meldrum tell you only one thing that signified for she has no real knowledge but that one thing was everything what is it then why that she can t bear the sight of her his pronouns required some arranging but after i had successfully dealt with them i replied that i was quite aware of miss saunt s trick of turning her back on the good lady of folkestone only what did that prove have you never guessed i guessed as soon as she spoke dawling towered over me in dismal triumph it was the first time in our acquaintance that on any ground of understanding this had occurred but even so remarkable an incident still left me sufficiently at sea to cause him to continue why the effect of those spectacles i seemed to catch the tail of his idea mrs meldrum s they re so awfully ugly and they add so to the dear woman s ugliness this remark began to flash a light and when he quickly added she sees herself she sees her own fate my response was so immediate that i had almost taken the words out of his mouth while i tried to fix this sudden image of flora s face glazed in and cross barred even as mrs meldrum s was glazed and barred he went on to assert that only the horror of that image looming out at herself could be the reason of her avoiding the person who so forced it home the fact he had encountered made everything hideously vivid and more vivid than anything else that just such another pair of goggles was what would have been prescribed to flora i see i see i presently returned what would become of lord iffield if she were suddenly to come out in them what indeed would become of every one what would become of everything this was an enquiry that dawling was evidently unprepared to meet and i completed it by saying at last my dear fellow for that matter what would become of you once more he turned on me his good green eyes oh i shouldn t mind the tone of his words somehow made his ugly face beautiful and i discovered at this moment how much i really liked him none the less at the same time perversely and rudely i felt the droll side of our discussion of such alternatives it made me laugh out and say to him while i laughed you d take her even with those things of mrs meldrum s he remained mournfully grave i could see that he was surprised at my rude mirth but he summoned back a vision of the lady at folkestone and conscientiously replied even with those things of mrs meldrum s i begged him not to resent my laughter which but exposed the fact that we had built a monstrous castle in the air didn t he see on what flimsy ground the structure rested the evidence was preposterously small he believed the worst but we were really uninformed i shall find out the truth he promptly replied how can you if you question her you ll simply drive her to perjure herself wherein after all does it concern you to know the truth it s the girl s own affair then why did you tell me your story i was a trifle embarrassed to warn you off i smiled he took no more notice of these words than presently to remark that lord iffield had no serious intentions very possibly i said but you mustn t speak as if lord iffield and you were her only alternatives dawling thought a moment couldn t something be got out of the people she has consulted she must have been to people how else can she have been condemned condemned to what condemned to perpetual nippers of course she has consulted some of the big specialists but she has done it you may be sure in the most clandestine manner and even if it were supposable that they would tell you anything which i altogether doubt you would have great difficulty in finding out which men they are therefore leave it alone never show her what you suspect i even before he quitted me asked him to promise me this all right i promise but he was gloomy enough he was a lover facing the fact that there was no limit to the deceit his loved one was ready to practise it made so remarkably little difference i could see by what a stretch his passionate pity would from this moment overlook the girl s fatuity and folly she was always accessible to him that i knew for if she had told him he was an idiot to dream she could dream of him she would have rebuked the imputation of having failed to make it clear that she would always be glad to regard him as a friend what were most of her friends what were all of them but repudiated idiots i was perfectly aware that in her conversations and confidences i myself for instance had a niche in the gallery as regards poor dawling i knew how often he still called on the hammond synges it was not there but under the wing of the floyd taylors that her intimacy with lord iffield most flourished at all events when a week after the visit i have just summarised flora s name was one morning brought up to me i jumped at the conclusion that dawling had been with her and even i fear briefly entertained the thought that he had broken his word chapter ix she left me after she had been introduced in no suspense about her present motive she was on the contrary in a visible fever to enlighten me but i promptly learned that for the alarm with which she pitiably panted our young man was not accountable she had but one thought in the world and that thought was for lord iffield i had the strangest saddest scene with her and if it did me no other good it at least made me at last completely understand why insidiously from the first she had struck me as a creature of tragedy in showing me the whole of her folly it lifted the curtain of her misery i don t know how much she meant to tell me when she came i think she had had plans of elaborate misrepresentation at any rate she found it at the end of ten minutes the simplest way to break down and sob to be wretched and true when she had once begun to let herself go the movement took her off her feet the relief of it was like the cessation of a cramp she shared in a word her long secret she shifted her sharp pain she brought i confess tears to my own eyes tears of helpless tenderness for her helpless poverty her visit however was not quite so memorable in itself as in some of its consequences the most immediate of which was that i went that afternoon to see geoffrey dawling who had in those days rooms in welbeck street where i presented myself at an hour late enough to warrant the supposition that he might have come in he had not come in but he was expected and i was invited to enter and wait for him a lady i was informed was already in his sitting room i hesitated a little at a loss it had wildly coursed through my brain that the lady was perhaps flora saunt but when i asked if she were young and remarkably pretty i received so significant a no sir that i risked an advance and after a minute in this manner found myself to my astonishment face to face with mrs meldrum oh you dear thing she exclaimed i m delighted to see you you spare me another compromising demarche but for this i should have called on you also know the worst at once if you see me here it s at least deliberate it s planned plotted shameless i came up on purpose to see him upon my word i m in love with him why if you valued my peace of mind did you let him the other day at folkestone dawn upon my delighted eyes i found myself there in half an hour simply infatuated with him with a perfect sense of everything that can be urged against him i hold him none the less the very pearl of men however i haven t come up to declare my passion i ve come to bring him news that will interest him much more above all i ve come to urge upon him to be careful about flora saunt about what he says and does he must be as still as a mouse she s at last really engaged but it s a tremendous secret i was moved to mirth precisely she wired me this noon and spent another shilling to tell me that not a creature in the world is yet to know it she had better have spent it to tell you that she had just passed an hour with the creature you see before you she has just passed an hour with every one in the place mrs meldrum cried they ve vital reasons she says for it s not coming out for a month then it will be formally announced but meanwhile her rejoicing is wild i daresay mr dawling already knows and as it s nearly seven o clock may have jumped off london bridge but an effect of the talk i had with him the other day was to make me on receipt of my telegram feel it to be my duty to warn him in person against taking action so to call it on the horrid certitude which i could see he carried away with him i had added somehow to that certitude he told me what you had told him you had seen in your shop mrs meldrum i perceived had come to welbeck street on an errand identical with my own a circumstance indicating her rare sagacity inasmuch as her ground for undertaking it was a very different thing from what flora s wonderful visit had made of mine i remarked to her that what i had seen in the shop was sufficiently striking but that i had seen a great deal more that morning in my studio in short i said i ve seen everything she was mystified everything the poor creature is under the darkest of clouds oh she came to triumph but she remained to talk something in the nature of sense she put herself completely in my hands she does me the honour to intimate that of all her friends i m the most disinterested after she had announced to me that lord iffield was utterly committed to her and that for the present i was absolutely the only person in the secret she arrived at her real business she had had a suspicion of me ever since that day at folkestone when i asked her for the truth about her eyes the truth is what you and i both guessed she s in very bad danger but from what cause i who by god s mercy have kept mine know everything that can be known about eyes said mrs meldrum she might have kept hers if she had profited by god s mercy if she had done in time done years ago what was imperatively ordered her if she hadn t in fine been cursed with the loveliness that was to make her behaviour a thing of fable she may still keep her sight or what remains of it if she ll sacrifice and after all so little that purely superficial charm she must do as you ve done she must wear dear lady what you wear what my companion wore glittered for the moment like a melon frame in august heaven forgive her now i understand she flushed for dismay but i wasn t afraid of the effect on her good nature of her thus seeing through her great goggles why it had always been that flora held her at such a distance i can t tell you i said from what special affection what state of the eye her danger proceeds that s the one thing she succeeded this morning in keeping from me she knows it herself perfectly she has had the best advice in europe it s a thing that s awful simply awful that was the only account she would give me year before last while she was at boulogne she went for three days with mrs floyd taylor to paris she there surreptitiously consulted the greatest man even mrs floyd taylor doesn t know last autumn in germany she did the same first put on certain special spectacles with a straight bar in the middle then we ll talk that s practically what they say what she says is that she ll put on anything in nature when she s married but that she must get married first she has always meant to do everything as soon as she s married then and then only she ll be safe how will any one ever look at her if she makes herself a fright how could she ever have got engaged if she had made herself a fright from the first it s no use to insist that with her beauty she can never be a fright she said to me this morning poor girl the most characteristic the most harrowing things my face is all i have and such a face i knew from the first i could do anything with it but i needed it all i need it still every exquisite inch of it it isn t as if i had a figure or anything else oh if god had only given me a figure too i don t say yes with a figure a really good one like fanny floyd taylor s who s hideous i d have risked plain glasses que voulez vous no one is perfect she says she still has money left but i don t believe a word of it she has been speculating on her impunity on the idea that her danger would hold off she has literally been running a race with it her theory has been as you from the first so clearly saw that she d get in ahead she swears to me that though the bar is too cruel she wears when she s alone what she has been ordered to wear but when the deuce is she alone it s herself of course that she has swindled worst she has put herself off so insanely that even her conceit but half accounts for it with little inadequate concessions little false measures and preposterous evasions and childish hopes her great terror is now that iffield who already has suspicions who has found out her pince nez but whom she has beguiled with some unblushing hocus pocus may discover the dreadful facts and the essence of what she wanted this morning was in that interest to square me to get me to deny indignantly and authoritatively for isn t she my favourite sitter that she has anything in life the matter with any part of her she sobbed she went on she entreated after we got talking her extraordinary nerve left her and she showed me what she has been through showed me also all her terror of the harm i could do her wait till i m married wait till i m married she took hold of me she almost sank on her knees it seems to me highly immoral one s participation in her fraud but there s no doubt that she must be married i don t know what i don t see behind it therefore i wound up dawling must keep his hands off mrs meldrum had held her breath she gave out a long moan well that s exactly what i came here to tell him then here he is our host all unprepared his latchkey still in his hand had just pushed open the door and startled at finding us turned a frightened look from one to the other wondering what disaster we were there to announce or avert mrs meldrum was on the spot all gaiety i ve come to return your sweet visit ah she laughed i mean to keep up the acquaintance do do he murmured mechanically and absently continuing to look at us then he broke out he s going to marry her i was surprised you already know he produced an evening paper which he tossed down on the table it s in that published already i was still more surprised oh flora can t keep a secret mrs meldrum made it light she went up to poor dawling and laid a motherly hand upon him it s all right it s just as it ought to be don t think about her ever any more then as he met this adjuration with a stare from which thought and of the most defiant and dismal fairly protruded the excellent woman put up her funny face and tenderly kissed him on the cheek chapter x i have spoken of these reminiscences as of a row of coloured beads and i confess that as i continue to straighten out my chaplet i am rather proud of the comparison the beads are all there as i said they slip along the string in their small smooth roundness geoffrey dawling accepted as a gentleman the event his evening paper had proclaimed in view of which i snatched a moment to nudge him a hint that he might offer mrs meldrum his hand he returned me a heavy head shake and i judged that marriage would henceforth strike him very much as the traffic of the street may strike some poor incurable at the window of an hospital circumstances arising at this time led to my making an absence from england and circumstances already existing offered him a firm basis for similar action he had after all the usual resource of a briton he could take to his boats always drawn up in our background he started on a journey round the globe and i was left with nothing but my inference as to what might have happened later observation however only confirmed my belief that if at any time during the couple of months after flora saunt s brilliant engagement he had made up as they say to the good lady of folkestone that good lady would not have pushed him over the cliff strange as she was to behold i knew of cases in which she had been obliged to administer that shove i went to new york to paint a couple of portraits but i found once on the spot that i had counted without chicago where i was invited to blot out this harsh discrimination by the production of some dozen i spent a year in america and should probably have spent a second had i not been summoned back to england by alarming news from my mother her strength had failed and as soon as i reached london i hurried down to folkestone arriving just at the moment to offer a welcome to some slight symptom of a rally she had been much worse but was now a little better and though i found nothing but satisfaction in having come to her i saw after a few hours that my london studio where arrears of work had already met me would be my place to await whatever might next occur yet before returning to town i called on mrs meldrum from whom i had not had a line and my view of whom with the adjacent objects as i had left them had been intercepted by a luxuriant foreground before i had gained her house i met her as i supposed coming toward me across the down greeting me from afar with the familiar twinkle of her great vitreous badge and as it was late in the autumn and the esplanade a blank i was free to acknowledge this signal by cutting a caper on the grass my enthusiasm dropped indeed the next moment for i had seen in a few more seconds that the person thus assaulted had by no means the figure of my military friend i felt a shock much greater than any i should have thought possible when on this person s drawing near i knew her for poor little flora saunt at what moment she had recognised me belonged to an order of mysteries over which it quickly came home to me one would never linger again once we were face to face it so chiefly mattered that i should succeed in looking entirely unastonished all i at first saw was the big gold bar crossing each of her lenses over which something convex and grotesque like the eyes of a large insect something that now represented her whole personality seemed as out of the orifice of a prison to strain forward and press the face had shrunk away it looked smaller appeared even to look plain it was at all events so far as the effect on a spectator was concerned wholly sacrificed to this huge apparatus of sight there was no smile in it and she made no motion to take my offered hand i had no idea you were down here i said and i wondered whether she didn t know me at all or knew me only by my voice you thought i was mrs meldrum she ever so quietly answered it was just this low pitch that made me protest with laughter oh yes you have a tremendous deal in common with mrs meldrum i ve just returned to england after a long absence and i m on my way to see her won t you come with me it struck me that her old reason for keeping clear of our friend was well disposed of now i ve just left her i m staying with her she stood solemnly fixing me with her goggles would you like to paint me now she asked she seemed to speak with intense gravity from behind a mask or a cage there was nothing to do but treat the question still with high spirits it would be a fascinating little artistic problem that something was wrong it wasn t difficult to see but a good deal more than met the eye might be presumed to be wrong if flora was under mrs meldrum s roof i hadn t for a year had much time to think of her but my imagination had had ground for lodging her in more gilded halls one of the last things i had heard before leaving england was that in commemoration of the new relationship she had gone to stay with lady considine this had made me take everything else for granted and the noisy american world had deafened my care to possible contradictions her spectacles were at present a direct contradiction they seemed a negation not only of new relationships but of every old one as well i remember nevertheless that when after a moment she walked beside me on the grass i found myself nervously hoping she wouldn t as yet at any rate tell me anything very dreadful so that to stave off this danger i harried her with questions about mrs meldrum and without waiting for replies became profuse on the subject of my own doings my companion was finely silent and i felt both as if she were watching my nervousness with a sort of sinister irony and as if i were talking to some different and strange person flora plain and obscure and dumb was no flora at all at mrs meldrum s door she turned off with the observation that as there was certainly a great deal i should have to say to our friend she had better not go in with me i looked at her again i had been keeping my eyes away from her but only to meet her magnified stare i greatly desired in truth to see mrs meldrum alone but there was something so grim in the girl s trouble that i hesitated to fall in with this idea of dropping her yet one couldn t express a compassion without seeming to take for granted more trouble than there actually might have been i reflected that i must really figure to her as a fool which was an entertainment i had never expected to give her it rolled over me there for the first time it has come back to me since that there is wondrously in very deep and even in very foolish misfortune a dignity still finer than in the most inveterate habit of being all right i couldn t have to her the manner of treating it as a mere detail that i was face to face with a part of what at our last meeting we had had such a scene about but while i was trying to think of some manner that i could have she said quite colourlessly though somehow as if she might never see me again good bye i m going to take my walk all alone she looked round the great bleak cliff top with whom should i go besides i like to be alone for the present this gave me the glimmer of a vision that she regarded her disfigurement as temporary and the confidence came to me that she would never for her happiness cease to be a creature of illusions it enabled me to exclaim smiling brightly and feeling indeed idiotic oh i shall see you again but i hope you ll have a very pleasant walk all my walks are pleasant thank you they do me such a lot of good she was as quiet as a mouse and her words seemed to me stupendous in their wisdom i take several a day she continued she might have been an ancient woman responding with humility at the church door to the patronage of the parson the more i take the better i feel i m ordered by the doctors to keep all the while in the air and go in for plenty of exercise it keeps up my general health you know and if that goes on improving as it has lately done everything will soon be all right all that was the matter with me before and always it was too reckless was that i neglected my general health it acts directly on the state of the particular organ so i m going three miles i grinned at her from the doorstep while mrs meldrum s maid stood there to admit me oh i m so glad i said looking at her as she paced away with the pretty flutter she had kept and remembering the day when while she rejoined lord iffield i had indulged in the same observation her air of assurance was on this occasion not less than it had been on that but i recalled that she had then struck me as marching off to her doom was she really now marching away from it chapter xi as soon as i saw mrs meldrum i of course broke out is there anything in it is her general health mrs meldrum checked me with her great amused blare you ve already seen her and she has told you her wondrous tale what s in it is what has been in everything she has ever done the most comical tragical belief in herself she thinks she s doing a cure and what does her husband think her husband what husband hasn t she then married lord iffield vous en etes le cried my hostess why he behaved like a regular beast how should i know you never wrote me mrs meldrum hesitated covering me with what poor flora called the particular organ no i didn t write you i abstained on purpose if i kept quiet i thought you mightn t hear over there what had happened if you should hear i was afraid you would stir up mr dawling stir him up urge him to fly to the rescue write out to him that there was another chance for him i wouldn t have done it i said well mrs meldrum replied it was not my business to give you an opportunity in short you were afraid of it again she hesitated and though it may have been only my fancy i thought she considerably reddened at all events she laughed out then i was afraid of it she very honestly answered but doesn t he know has he given no sign every sign in life he came straight back to her he did everything to get her to listen to him but she hasn t the smallest idea of it has he seen her as she is now i presently and just a trifle awkwardly enquired indeed he has and borne it like a hero he told me all about it how much you ve all been through i found occasion to remark then what has become of him he s at home in hampshire he has got back his old place and i believe by this time his old sisters it s not half a bad little place yet its attractions say nothing to flora oh flora s by no means on her back my fried declared she s not on her back because she s on yours have you got her for the rest of your life once more mrs meldrum genially glared did she tell you how much the hammond synges have kindly left her to live on not quite eighty pounds a year that s a good deal but it won t pay the oculist what was it that at last induced her to submit to him her general collapse after that brute of an iffield s rupture she cried her eyes out she passed through a horror of black darkness then came a gleam of light and the light appears to have broadened she went into goggles as repentant magdalens go into the catholic church in spite of which you don t think she ll be saved she thinks she will that s all i can tell you there s no doubt that when once she brought herself to accept her real remedy as she calls it she began to enjoy a relief that she had never known that feeling very new and in spite of what she pays for it most refreshing has given her something to hold on by begotten in her foolish little mind a belief that as she says she s on the mend and that in the course of time if she leads a tremendously healthy life she ll be able to take off her muzzle and become as dangerous again as ever it keeps her going and what keeps you you re good until the parties begin again oh she doesn t object to me now smiled mrs meldrum i m going to take her abroad we shall be a pretty pair i was struck with this energy and after a moment i enquired the reason of it it s to divert her mind my friend replied reddening again a little i thought we shall go next week i ve only waited to see how your mother would be before starting i expressed to her hereupon my sense of her extraordinary merit and also that of the inconceivability of flora s fancying herself still in a situation not to jump at the chance of marrying a man like dawling she says he s too ugly she says he s too dreary she says in fact he s nobody mrs meldrum pursued she says above all that he s not her own sort she doesn t deny that he s good but she finds him impossibly ridiculous he s quite the last person she would ever dream of i was almost disposed on hearing this to protest that if the girl had so little proper feeling her noble suitor had perhaps served her right but after a while my curiosity as to just how her noble suitor had served her got the better of that emotion and i asked a question or two which led my companion again to apply to him the invidious term i have already quoted what had happened was simply that flora had at the eleventh hour broken down in the attempt to put him off with an uncandid account of her infirmity and that his lordship s interest in her had not been proof against the discovery of the way she had practised on him her dissimulation he was obliged to perceive had been infernally deep the future in short assumed a new complexion for him when looked at through the grim glasses of a bride who as he had said to some one couldn t really when you came to find out see her hand before her face he had conducted himself like any other jockeyed customer he had returned the animal as unsound he had backed out in his own way giving the business by some sharp shuffle such a turn as to make the rupture ostensibly flora s but he had none the less remorselessly and basely backed out he had cared for her lovely face cared for it in the amused and haunted way it had been her poor little delusive gift to make men care and her lovely face damn it with the monstrous gear she had begun to rig upon it was just what had let him in he had in the judgment of his family done everything that could be expected of him he had made mrs meldrum had herself seen the letter a handsome offer of pecuniary compensation oh if flora with her incredible buoyancy was in a manner on her feet again now it was not that she had not for weeks and weeks been prone in the dust strange were the humiliations the forms of anguish it was given some natures to survive that flora had survived was perhaps after all a proof she was reserved for some final mercy but she has been in the abysses at any rate said mrs meldrum and i really don t think i can tell you what pulled her through i think i can tell you i returned what in the world but mrs meldrum at the end of an hour flora had not come in and i was obliged to announce that i should have but time to reach the station where i was to find my luggage in charge of my mother s servant mrs meldrum put before me the question of waiting till a later train so as not to lose our young lady but i confess i gave this alternative a consideration less acute than i pretended somehow i didn t care if i did lose our young lady now that i knew the worst that had befallen her it struck me still less as possible to meet her on the ground of condolence and with the sad appearance she wore to me what other ground was left i lost her but i caught my train in truth she was so changed that one hated to see it and now that she was in charitable hands one didn t feel compelled to make great efforts i had studied her face for a particular beauty i had lived with that beauty and reproduced it but i knew what belonged to my trade well enough to be sure it was gone for ever chapter xii i was soon called back to folkestone but mrs meldrum and her young friend had already left england finding to that end every convenience on the spot and not having had to come up to town my thoughts however were so painfully engaged there that i should in any case have had little attention for them the event occurred that was to bring my series of visits to a close when this high tide had ebbed i returned to america and to my interrupted work which had opened out on such a scale that with a deep plunge into a great chance i was three good years in rising again to the surface there are nymphs and naiads moreover in the american depths they may have had something to do with the duration of my dive i mention them to account for a grave misdemeanor the fact that after the first year i rudely neglected mrs meldrum she had written to me from florence after my mother s death and had mentioned in a postscript that in our young lady s calculations the lowest figures were now italian counts this was a good omen and if in subsequent letters there was no news of a sequel i was content to accept small things and to believe that grave tidings should there be any would come to me in due course the gravity of what might happen to a featherweight became indeed with time and distance less appreciable and i was not without an impression that mrs meldrum whose sense of proportion was not the least of her merits had no idea of boring the world with the ups and downs of her pensioner the poor girl grew dusky and dim a small fitful memory a regret tempered by the comfortable consciousness of how kind mrs meldrum would always be to her i was professionally more preoccupied than i had ever been and i had swarms of pretty faces in my eyes and a chorus of loud tones in my ears geoffrey dawling had on his return to england written me two or three letters his last information had been that he was going into the figures of rural illiteracy i was delighted to receive it and had no doubt that if he should go into figures they would as they are said to be able to prove anything prove at least that my advice was sound and that he had wasted time enough this quickened on my part another hope a hope suggested by some roundabout rumour i forget how it reached me that he was engaged to a girl down in hampshire he turned out not to be but i felt sure that if only he went into figures deep enough he would become among the girls down in hampshire or elsewhere one of those numerous prizes of battle whose defences are practically not on the scale of their provocations i nursed in short the thought that it was probably open to him to develop as one of the types about whom as the years go on superficial critics wonder without relief how they ever succeeded in dragging a bride to the altar he never alluded to flora saunt and there was in his silence about her quite as in mrs meldrum s an element of instinctive tact a brief implication that if you didn t happen to have been in love with her there was nothing to be said within a week after my return to london i went to the opera of which i had always been much of a devotee i arrived too late for the first act of lohengrin but the second was just beginning and i gave myself up to it with no more than a glance at the house when it was over i treated myself with my glass from my place in the stalls to a general survey of the boxes making doubtless on their contents the reflections pointed by comparison that are most familiar to the wanderer restored to london there was the common sprinkling of pretty women but i suddenly noted that one of these was far prettier than the others this lady alone in one of the smaller receptacles of the grand tier and already the aim of fifty tentative glasses which she sustained with admirable serenity this single exquisite figure placed in the quarter furthest removed from my stall was a person i immediately felt to cause one s curiosity to linger dressed in white with diamonds in her hair and pearls on her neck she had a pale radiance of beauty which even at that distance made her a distinguished presence and with the air that easily attaches to lonely loveliness in public places an agreeable mystery a mystery however she remained to me only for a minute after i had levelled my glass at her i feel to this moment the startled thrill the shock almost of joy with which i translated her vague brightness into a resurrection of flora i say a resurrection because to put it crudely i had on that last occasion left our young woman for dead at present perfectly alive again she was altered only as it were by this fact of life a little older a little quieter a little finer and a good deal fairer she was simply transfigured by having recovered sustained by the reflection that even her recovery wouldn t enable her to distinguish me in the crowd i was free to look at her well then it was it came home to me that my vision of her in her great goggles had been cruelly final as her beauty was all there was of her that machinery had extinguished her and so far as i had thought of her in the interval i had thought of her as buried in the tomb her stern specialist had built with the sense that she had escaped from it came a lively wish to return to her and if i didn t straightway leave my place and rush round the theatre and up to her box it was because i was fixed to the spot some moments longer by the simple inability to cease looking at her she had been from the first of my seeing her practically motionless leaning back in her chair with a kind of thoughtful grace and with her eyes vaguely directed as it seemed on me to one of the boxes on my side of the house and consequently over my head and out of my sight the only movement she made for some time was to finger with an ungloved hand and as if with the habit of fondness the row of pearls on her neck which my glass showed me to be large and splendid her diamonds and pearls in her solitude mystified me making me as she had had no such brave jewels in the days of the hammond synges wonder what undreamt of improvement had taken place in her fortunes the ghost of a question hovered there a moment could anything so prodigious have happened as that on her tested and proved amendment lord iffield had taken her back this could scarce have without my hearing of it and moreover if she had become a person of such fashion where was the little court one would naturally see at her elbow her isolation was puzzling though it could easily suggest that she was but momentarily alone if she had come with mrs meldrum that lady would have taken advantage of the interval to pay a visit to some other box doubtless the box at which flora had just been looking mrs meldrum didn t account for the jewels but the revival of flora s beauty accounted for anything she presently moved her eyes over the house and i felt them brush me again like the wings of a dove i don t know what quick pleasure flickered into the hope that she would at last see me she did see me she suddenly bent forward to take up the little double barrelled ivory glass that rested on the edge of the box and to all appearance fix me with it i smiled from my place straight up at the searching lenses and after an instant she dropped them and smiled as straight back at me oh her smile it was her old smile her young smile her very own smile made perfect i instantly left my stall and hurried off for a nearer view of it quite flushed i remember as i went with the annoyance of having happened to think of the idiotic way i had tried to paint her poor iffield with his sample of that error and still poorer dawling in particular with his i hadn t touched her i was professionally humiliated and as the attendant in the lobby opened her box for me i felt that the very first thing i should have to say to her would be that she must absolutely sit to me again chapter xiii she gave me the smile once more as over her shoulder from her chair she turned her face to me here you are again she exclaimed with her disgloved hand put up a little backward for me to take i dropped into a chair just behind her and having taken it and noted that one of the curtains of the box would make the demonstration sufficiently private bent my lips over it and impressed them on its finger tips it was given me however to my astonishment to feel next that all the privacy in the world couldn t have sufficed to mitigate the start with which she greeted this free application of my moustache the blood had jumped to her face she quickly recovered her hand and jerked at me twisting herself round a vacant challenging stare during the next few instants several extraordinary things happened the first of which was that now i was close to them the eyes of loveliness i had come up to look into didn t show at all the conscious light i had just been pleased to see them flash across the house they showed on the contrary to my confusion a strange sweet blankness an expression i failed to give a meaning to until without delay i felt on my arm directed to it as if instantly to efface the effect of her start the grasp of the hand she had impulsively snatched from me it was the irrepressible question in this grasp that stopped on my lips all sound of salutation she had mistaken my entrance for that of another person a pair of lips without a moustache she was feeling me to see who i was with the perception of this and of her not seeing me i sat gaping at her and at the wild word that didn t come the right word to express or to disguise my dismay what was the right word to commemorate one s sudden discovery at the very moment too at which one had been most encouraged to count on better things that one s dear old friend had gone blind before the answer to this question dropped upon me and the moving moments though few seemed many i heard with the sound of voices the click of the attendant s key on the other side of the door poor flora heard also and on hearing still with her hand on my arm brightened again as i had a minute since seen her brighten across the house she had the sense of the return of the person she had taken me for the person with the right pair of lips as to whom i was for that matter much more in the dark than she i gasped but my word had come if she had lost her sight it was in this very loss that she had found again her beauty i managed to speak while we were still alone before her companion had appeared you re lovelier at this day than you have ever been in your life at the sound of my voice and that of the opening of the door her impatience broke into audible joy she sprang up recognising me always holding me and gleefully cried to a gentleman who was arrested in the doorway by the sight of me he has come back he has come back and you should have heard what he says of me the gentleman was geoffrey dawling and i thought it best to let him hear on the spot how beautiful she is my dear man but how extraordinarily beautiful more beautiful at this hour than ever ever before it gave them almost equal pleasure and made dawling blush to his eyes while this in turn produced in spite of deepened astonishment a blest snap of the strain i had been struggling with i wanted to embrace them both and while the opening bars of another scene rose from the orchestra i almost did embrace dawling whose first emotion on beholding me had visibly and ever so oddly been a consciousness of guilt i had caught him somehow in the act though that was as yet all i knew but by the time we sank noiselessly into our chairs again for the music was supreme wagner passed first my demonstration ought pretty well to have given him the limit of the criticism he had to fear i myself indeed while the opera blazed was only too afraid he might divine in our silent closeness the very moral of my optimism which was simply the comfort i had gathered from seeing that if our companion s beauty lived again her vanity partook of its life i had hit on the right note that was what eased me off it drew all pain for the next half hour from the sense of the deep darkness in which the stricken woman sat if the music in that darkness happily soared and swelled for her it beat its wings in unison with those of a gratified passion a great deal came and went between us without profaning the occasion so that i could feel at the end of twenty minutes as if i knew almost everything he might in kindness have to tell me knew even why flora while i stared at her from the stalls had misled me by the use of ivory and crystal and by appearing to recognise me and smile she leaned back in her chair in luxurious ease i had from the first become aware that the way she fingered her pearls was a sharp image of the wedded state nothing of old had seemed wanting to her assurance but i hadn t then dreamed of the art with which she would wear that assurance as a married woman she had taken him when everything had failed he had taken her when she herself had done so his embarrassed eyes confessed it all confessed the deep peace he found in it they only didn t tell me why he had not written to me nor clear up as yet a minor obscurity flora after a while again lifted the glass from the ledge of the box and elegantly swept the house with it then by the mere instinct of her grace a motion but half conscious she inclined her head into the void with the sketch of a salute producing i could see a perfect imitation of response to some homage dawling and i looked at each other again the tears came into his eyes she was playing at perfection still and her misfortune only simplified the process i recognised that this was as near as i should ever come certainly as i should come that night to pressing on her misfortune neither of us would name it more than we were doing then and flora would never name it at all little by little i saw that what had occurred was strange as it might appear the best thing for her happiness the question was now only of her beauty and her being seen and marvelled at with dawling to do for her everything in life her activity was limited to that such an activity was all within her scope it asked nothing of her that she couldn t splendidly give as from time to time in our delicate communion she turned her face to me with the parody of a look i lost none of the signs of its strange new glory the expression of the eyes was a rub of pastel from a master s thumb the whole head stamped with a sort of showy suffering had gained a fineness from what she had passed through yes flora was settled for life nothing could hurt her further i foresaw the particular praise she would mostly incur she would be invariably interesting she would charm with her pathos more even than she had charmed with her pleasure for herself above all she was fixed for ever rescued from all change and ransomed from all doubt her old certainties her old vanities were justified and sanctified and in the darkness that had closed upon her one object remained clear that object as unfading as a mosaic mask was fortunately the loveliest she could possibly look upon the greatest blessing of all was of course that dawling thought so her future was ruled with the straightest line and so for that matter was his there were two facts to which before i left my friends i gave time to sink into my spirit one was that he had changed by some process as effective as flora s change had been simplified somehow into service as she had been simplified into success he was such a picture of inspired intervention as i had never yet conceived he would exist henceforth for the sole purpose of rendering unnecessary or rather impossible any reference even on her own part to his wife s infirmity oh yes how little desire he would ever give me to refer to it he principally after a while made me feel and this was my second lesson that good natured as he was my being there to see it all oppressed him so that by the time the act ended i recognised that i too had filled out my hour dawling remembered things i think he caught in my very face the irony of old judgments they made him thresh about in his chair i said to flora as i took leave of her that i would come to see her but i may mention that i never went i d go to morrow if i hear she wants me but what in the world can she ever want as i quitted them i laid my hand on dawling s arm and drew him for a moment into the lobby why did you never write to me of your marriage he smiled uncomfortably showing his long yellow teeth and something more i don t know the whole thing gave me such a tremendous lot to do this was the first dishonest speech i had heard him make he really hadn t written because an idea that i would think him a still bigger fool than before i didn t insist but i tried there in the lobby so far as a pressure of his hand could serve me to give him a notion of what i thought him i can t at any rate make out i said why i didn t hear from mrs meldrum she didn t write to you never a word what has become of her i think she s at folkestone dawling returned but i m sorry to say that practically she has ceased to see us you haven t quarrelled with her how could we think of all we owe her at the time of our marriage and for months before she did everything for us i don t know how we should have managed without her but since then she has never been near us and has given us rather markedly little encouragement to keep up relations with her i was struck with this though of course i admit i am struck with all sorts of things well i said after a moment even if i could imagine a reason for that attitude it wouldn t explain why she shouldn t have taken account of my natural interest just so dawling s face was a windowless wall he could contribute nothing to the mystery and quitting him i carried it away it was not till i went down to ace mrs meldrum that was really dispelled she didn t want to hear of them or to talk of them not a bit and it was just in the same spirit that she hadn t wanted to write of them she had done everything in the world for them but now thank heaven the hard business was over after i had taken this in which i was quick to do we quite avoided the subject she simply couldn t bear it the golden bowl volume i henry james book first the prince part first i the prince had always liked his london when it had come to him he was one of the modern romans who find by the thames a more convincing image of the truth of the ancient state than any they have left by the tiber brought up on the legend of the city to which the world paid tribute he recognised in the present london much more than in contemporary rome the real dimensions of such a case if it was a question of an imperium he said to himself and if one wished as a roman to recover a little the sense of that the place to do so was on london bridge or even on a fine afternoon in may at hyde park corner it was not indeed to either of those places that these grounds of his predilection after all sufficiently vague had at the moment we are concerned with him guided his steps he had strayed simply enough into bond street where his imagination working at comparatively short range caused him now and then to stop before a window in which objects massive and lumpish in silver and gold in the forms to which precious stones contribute or in leather steel brass applied to a hundred uses and abuses were as tumbled together as if in the insolence of the empire they had been the loot of far off victories the young man s movements however betrayed no consistency of attention not even for that matter when one of his arrests had proceeded from possibilities in faces shaded as they passed him on the pavement by huge beribboned hats or more delicately tinted still under the tense silk of parasols held at perverse angles in waiting victorias and the prince s undirected thought was not a little symptomatic since though the turn of the season had come and the flush of the streets begun to fade the possibilities of faces on the august afternoon were still one of the notes of the scene he was too restless that was the fact for any concentration and the last idea that would just now have occurred to him in any connection was the idea of pursuit he had been pursuing for six months as never in his life before and what had actually unsteadied him as we join him was the sense of how he had been justified capture had crowned the pursuit or success as he would otherwise have put it had rewarded virtue whereby the consciousness of these things made him for the hour rather serious than gay a sobriety that might have consorted with failure sat in his handsome face constructively regular and grave yet at the same time oddly and as might be functionally almost radiant with its dark blue eyes its dark brown moustache and its expression no more sharply foreign to an english view than to have caused it sometimes to be observed of him with a shallow felicity that he looked like a refined irishman what had happened was that shortly before at three o clock his fate had practically been sealed and that even when one pretended to no quarrel with it the moment had something of the grimness of a crunched key in the strongest lock that could be made there was nothing to do as yet further but feel what one had done and our personage felt it while he aimlessly wandered it was already as if he were married so definitely had the solicitors at three o clock enabled the date to be fixed and by so few days was that date now distant he was to dine at half past eight o clock with the young lady on whose behalf and on whose father s the london lawyers had reached an inspired harmony with his own man of business poor calderoni fresh from rome and now apparently in the wondrous situation of being shown london before promptly leaving it again by mr verver himself mr verver whose easy way with his millions had taxed to such small purpose in the arrangements the principle of reciprocity the reciprocity with which the prince was during these minutes most struck was that of calderoni s bestowal of his company for a view of the lions if there was one thing in the world the young man at this juncture clearly intended it was to be much more decent as a son in law than lots of fellows he could think of had shown themselves in that character he thought of these fellows from whom he was so to differ in english he used mentally the english term to describe his difference for familiar with the tongue from his earliest years so that no note of strangeness remained with him either for lip or for ear he found it convenient in life for the greatest number of relations he found it convenient oddly even for his relation with himself though not unmindful that there might still as time went on be others including a more intimate degree of that one that would seek possibly with violence the larger or the finer issue which was it of the vernacular miss verver had told him he spoke english too well it was his only fault and he had not been able to speak worse even to oblige her when i speak worse you see i speak french he had said intimating thus that there were discriminations doubtless of the invidious kind for which that language was the most apt the girl had taken this she let him know as a reflection on her own french which she had always so dreamed of making good of making better to say nothing of his evident feeling that the idiom supposed a cleverness she was not a person to rise to the prince s answer to such remarks genial charming like every answer the parties to his new arrangement had yet had from him was that he was practising his american in order to converse properly on equal terms as it were with mr verver his prospective father in law had a command of it he said that put him at a disadvantage in any discussion besides which well besides which he had made to the girl the observation that positively of all his observations yet had most finely touched her you know i think he s a real galantuomo and no mistake there are plenty of sham ones about he seems to me simply the best man i ve ever seen in my life well my dear why shouldn t he be the girl had gaily inquired it was this precisely that had set the prince to think the things or many of them that had made mr verver what he was seemed practically to bring a charge of waste against the other things that with the other people known to the young man had failed of such a result why his form he had returned might have made one doubt father s form she hadn t seen it it strikes me he hasn t got any he hasn t got mine he hasn t even got yours thank you for even the girl had laughed at him oh yours my dear is tremendous but your father has his own i ve made that out so don t doubt it it s where it has brought him out that s the point it s his goodness that has brought him out our young woman had at this objected ah darling goodness i think never brought anyone out goodness when it s real precisely rather keeps people in he had been interested in his discrimination which amused him no it s his way it belongs to him but she had wondered still it s the american way that s all exactly it s all it s all i say it fits him so it must be good for something do you think it would be good for you maggie verver had smilingly asked to which his reply had been just of the happiest i don t feel my dear if you really want to know that anything much can now either hurt me or help me such as i am but you ll see for yourself say however i am a galantuomo which i devoutly hope i m like a chicken at best chopped up and smothered in sauce cooked down as a creme de volaille with half the parts left out your father s the natural fowl running about the bassecour his feathers movements his sounds those are the parts that with me are left out all as a matter of course since you can t eat a chicken alive the prince had not been annoyed at this but he had been positive well i m eating your father alive which is the only way to taste him i want to continue and as it s when he talks american that he is most alive so i must also cultivate it to get my pleasure he couldn t make one like him so much in any other language it mattered little that the girl had continued to demur it was the mere play of her joy i think he could make you like him in chinese it would be an unnecessary trouble what i mean is that he s a kind of result of his inevitable tone my liking is accordingly for the tone which has made him possible oh you ll hear enough of it she laughed before you ve done with us only this in truth had made him frown a little what do you mean please by my having done with you why found out about us all there is to find he had been able to take it indeed easily as a joke ah love i began with that i know enough i feel never to be surprised it s you yourselves meanwhile he continued who really know nothing there are two parts of me yes he had been moved to go on one is made up of the history the doings the marriages the crimes the follies the boundless betises of other people especially of their infamous waste of money that might have come to me those things are written literally in rows of volumes in libraries are as public as they re abominable everybody can get at them and you ve both of you wonderfully looked them in the face but there s another part very much smaller doubtless which such as it is represents my single self the unknown unimportant unimportant unimportant save to you personal quantity about this you ve found out nothing luckily my dear the girl had bravely said for what then would become please of the promised occupation of my future the young man remembered even now how extraordinarily clear he couldn t call it anything else she had looked in her prettiness as she had said it he also remembered what he had been moved to reply the happiest reigns we are taught you know are the reigns without any history oh i m not afraid of history she had been sure of that call it the bad part if you like yours certainly sticks out of you what was it else maggie verver had also said that made me originally think of you it wasn t as i should suppose you must have seen what you call your unknown quantity your particular self it was the generations behind you the follies and the crimes the plunder and the waste the wicked pope the monster most of all whom so many of the volumes in your family library are all about if i ve read but two or three yet i shall give myself up but the more as soon as i have time to the rest where therefore she had put it to him again without your archives annals infamies would you have been he recalled what to this he had gravely returned i might have been in a somewhat better pecuniary situation but his actual situation under the head in question positively so little mattered to them that having by that time lived deep into the sense of his advantage he had kept no impression of the girl s rejoinder it had but sweetened the waters in which he now floated tinted them as by the action of some essence poured from a gold topped phial for making one s bath aromatic no one before him never not even the infamous pope had so sat up to his neck in such a bath it showed for that matter how little one of his race could escape after all from history what was it but history and of their kind very much to have the assurance of the enjoyment of more money than the palace builder himself could have dreamed of this was the element that bore him up and into which maggie scattered on occasion her exquisite colouring drops they were of the colour of what on earth of what but the extraordinary american good faith they were of the colour of her innocence and yet at the same time of her imagination with which their relation his and these people s was all suffused what he had further said on the occasion of which we thus represent him as catching the echoes from his own thoughts while he loitered what he had further said came back to him for it had been the voice itself of his luck the soothing sound that was always with him you americans are almost incredibly romantic of course we are that s just what makes everything so nice for us everything he had wondered well everything that s nice at all the world the beautiful world or everything in it that is beautiful i mean we see so much he had looked at her a moment and he well knew how she had struck him in respect to the beautiful world as one of the beautiful the most beautiful things but what he had answered was you see too much that s what may sometimes make you difficulties when you don t at least he had amended with a further thought see too little but he had quite granted that he knew what she meant and his warning perhaps was needless he had seen the follies of the romantic disposition but there seemed somehow no follies in theirs nothing one was obliged to recognise but innocent pleasures pleasures without penalties their enjoyment was a tribute to others without being a loss to themselves only the funny thing he had respectfully submitted was that her father though older and wiser and a man into the bargain was as bad that is as good as herself oh he s better the girl had freely declared that is he s worse his relation to the things he cares for and i think it beautiful is absolutely romantic so is his whole life over here it s the most romantic thing i know you mean his idea for his native place yes the collection the museum with which he wishes to endow it and of which he thinks more as you know than of anything in the world it s the work of his life and the motive of everything he does the young man in his actual mood could have smiled again smiled delicately as he had then smiled at her has it been his motive in letting me have you yes my dear positively or in a manner she had said american city isn t by the way his native town for though he s not old it s a young thing compared with him a younger one he started there he has a feeling about it and the place has grown as he says like the programme of a charity performance you re at any rate a part of his collection she had explained one of the things that can only be got over here you re a rarity an object of beauty an object of price you re not perhaps absolutely unique but you re so curious and eminent that there are very few others like you you belong to a class about which everything is known you re what they call a morceau de musee i see i have the great sign of it he had risked that i cost a lot of money i haven t the least idea she had gravely answered what you cost and he had quite adored for the moment her way of saying it he had felt even for the moment vulgar but he had made the best of that wouldn t you find out if it were a question of parting with me my value would in that case be estimated she had looked at him with her charming eyes as if his value were well before her yes if you mean that i d pay rather than lose you and then there came again what this had made him say don t talk about me it s you who are not of this age you re a creature of a braver and finer one and the cinquecento at its most golden hour wouldn t have been ashamed of you it would of me and if i didn t know some of the pieces your father has acquired i should rather fear for american city the criticism of experts would it at all events be your idea he had then just ruefully asked to send me there for safety well we may have to come to it i ll go anywhere you want we must see first it will be only if we have to come to it there are things she had gone on that father puts away the bigger and more cumbrous of course which he stores has already stored in masses here and in paris in italy in spain in warehouses vaults banks safes wonderful secret places we ve been like a pair of pirates positively stage pirates the sort who wink at each other and say ha ha when they come to where their treasure is buried ours is buried pretty well everywhere except what we like to see what we travel with and have about us these the smaller pieces are the things we take out and arrange as we can to make the hotels we stay at and the houses we hire a little less ugly of course it s a danger and we have to keep watch but father loves a fine piece loves as he says the good of it and it s for the company of some of his things that he s willing to run his risks and we ve had extraordinary luck maggie had made that point we ve never lost anything yet and the finest objects are often the smallest values in lots of cases you must know have nothing to do with size but there s nothing however tiny she had wound up that we ve missed i like the class he had laughed for this in which you place me i shall be one of the little pieces that you unpack at the hotels or at the worst in the hired houses like this wonderful one and put out with the family photographs and the new magazines but it s something not to be so big that i have to be buried oh she had returned you shall not be buried my dear till you re dead unless indeed you call it burial to go to american city before i pronounce i should like to see my tomb so he had had after his fashion the last word in their interchange save for the result of an observation that had risen to his lips at the beginning which he had then checked and which now came back to him good bad or indifferent i hope there s one thing you believe about me he had sounded solemn even to himself but she had taken it gaily ah don t fix me down to one i believe things enough about you my dear to have a few left if most of them even go to smash i ve taken care of that i ve divided my faith into water tight compartments we must manage not to sink you do believe i m not a hypocrite you recognise that i don t lie or dissemble or deceive is that water tight the question to which he had given a certain intensity had made her he remembered stare an instant her colour rising as if it had sounded to her still stranger than he had intended he had perceived on the spot that any serious discussion of veracity of loyalty or rather of the want of them practically took her unprepared as if it were quite new to her he had noticed it before it was the english the american sign that duplicity like love had to be joked about it couldn t be gone into so the note of his inquiry was well to call it nothing else premature a mistake worth making however for the almost overdone drollery in which her answer instinctively sought refuge water tight the biggest compartment of all why it s the best cabin and the main deck and the engine room and the steward s pantry it s the ship itself it s the whole line it s the captain s table and all one s luggage one s reading for the trip she had images like that that were drawn from steamers and trains from a familiarity with lines a command of own cars from an experience of continents and seas that he was unable as yet to emulate from vast modern machineries and facilities whose acquaintance he had still to make but as to which it was part of the interest of his situation as it stood that he could quite without wincing feel his future likely to bristle with them it was in fact content as he was with his engagement and charming as he thought his affianced bride his view of that furniture that mainly constituted our young man s romance and to an extent that made of his inward state a contrast that he was intelligent enough to feel he was intelligent enough to feel quite humble to wish not to be in the least hard or voracious not to insist on his own side of the bargain to warn himself in short against arrogance and greed odd enough of a truth was his sense of this last danger which may illustrate moreover his general attitude toward dangers from within personally he considered he hadn t the vices in question and that was so much to the good his race on the other hand had had them handsomely enough and he was somehow full of his race its presence in him was like the consciousness of some inexpugnable scent in which his clothes his whole person his hands and the hair of his head might have been steeped as in some chemical bath the effect was nowhere in particular yet he constantly felt himself at the mercy of the cause he knew his antenatal history knew it in every detail and it was a thing to keep causes well before him what was his frank judgment of so much of its ugliness he asked himself but a part of the cultivation of humility what was this so important step he had just taken but the desire for some new history that should so far as possible contradict and even if need be flatly dishonour the old if what had come to him wouldn t do he must make something different he perfectly recognised always in his humility that the material for the making had to be mr verver s millions there was nothing else for him on earth to make it with he had tried before had had to look about and see the truth humble as he was at the same time he was not so humble as if he had known himself frivolous or stupid he had an idea which may amuse his historian that when you were stupid enough to be mistaken about such a matter you did know it therefore he wasn t mistaken his future might be might be scientific there was nothing in himself at all events to prevent it he was allying himself to science for it was science but the absence of prejudice backed by the presence of money his life would be full of machinery which was the antidote to superstition which was in its turn too much the consequence or at least the exhalation of archives he thought of these of his not being at all events futile and of his absolute acceptance of the developments of the coming age to redress the balance of his being so differently considered the moments when he most winced were those at which he found himself believing that really futility would have been forgiven him even with it in that absurd view he would have been good enough such was the laxity in the ververs of the romantic spirit they didn t indeed poor dears know what in that line the line of futility the real thing meant he did having seen it having tried it having taken its measure this was a memory in fact simply to screen out much as just in front of him while he walked the iron shutter of a shop closing early to the stale summer day rattled down at the turn of some crank there was machinery again just as the plate glass all about him was money was power the power of the rich peoples well he was of them now of the rich peoples he was on their side if it wasn t rather the pleasanter way of putting it that they were on his something of this sort was in any case the moral and the murmur of his walk it would have been ridiculous such a moral from such a source if it hadn t all somehow fitted to the gravity of the hour that gravity the oppression of which i began by recording another feature was the immediate nearness of the arrival of the contingent from home he was to meet them at charing cross on the morrow his younger brother who had married before him but whose wife of hebrew race with a portion that had gilded the pill was not in a condition to travel his sister and her husband the most anglicised of milanesi his maternal uncle the most shelved of diplomatists and his roman cousin don ottavio the most disponible of ex deputies and of relatives a scant handful of the consanguineous who in spite of maggie s plea for hymeneal reserve were to accompany him to the altar it was no great array yet it was apparently to be a more numerous muster than any possible to the bride herself having no wealth of kinship to choose from and making it up on the other hand by loose invitations he had been interested in the girl s attitude on the matter and had wholly deferred to it giving him as it did a glimpse distinctly pleasing of the kind of ruminations she would in general be governed by which were quite such as fell in with his own taste they hadn t natural relations she and her father she had explained so they wouldn t try to supply the place by artificial by make believe ones by any searching of highways and hedges oh yes they had acquaintances enough but a marriage was an intimate thing you asked acquaintances when you had your kith and kin you asked them over and above but you didn t ask them alone to cover your nudity and look like what they weren t she knew what she meant and what she liked and he was all ready to take from her finding a good omen in both of the facts he expected her desired her to have character his wife should have it and he wasn t afraid of her having much he had had in his earlier time to deal with plenty of people who had had it notably with the three four ecclesiastics his great uncle the cardinal above all who had taken a hand and played a part in his education the effect of all of which had never been to upset him he was thus fairly on the look out for the characteristic in this most intimate as she was to come of his associates he encouraged it when it appeared he felt therefore just at present as if his papers were in order as if his accounts so balanced as they had never done in his life before and he might close the portfolio with a snap it would open again doubtless of itself with the arrival of the romans it would even perhaps open with his dining to night in portland place where mr verver had pitched a tent suggesting that of alexander furnished with the spoils of darius but what meanwhile marked his crisis as i have said was his sense of the immediate two or three hours he paused on corners at crossings there kept rising for him in waves that consciousness sharp as to its source while vague as to its end which i began by speaking of the consciousness of an appeal to do something or other before it was too late for himself by any friend to whom he might have mentioned it the appeal could have been turned to frank derision for what for whom indeed but himself and the high advantages attached was he about to marry an extraordinarily charming girl whose prospects of the solid sort were as guaranteed as her amiability he wasn t to do it assuredly all for her the prince as happened however was so free to feel and yet not to formulate that there rose before him after a little definitely the image of a friend whom he had often found ironic he withheld the tribute of attention from passing faces only to let his impulse accumulate youth and beauty made him scarcely turn but the image of mrs assingham made him presently stop a hansom her youth her beauty were things more or less of the past but to find her at home as he possibly might would be doing what he still had time for would put something of a reason into his restlessness and thereby probably soothe it to recognise the propriety of this particular pilgrimage she lived far enough off in long cadogan place was already in fact to work it off a little a perception of the propriety of formally thanking her and of timing the act just as he happened to be doing this he made out as he went was obviously all that had been the matter with him it was true that he had mistaken the mood of the moment misread it rather superficially as an impulse to look the other way the other way from where his pledges had accumulated mrs assingham precisely represented embodied his pledges was in her pleasant person the force that had set them successively in motion she had made his marriage quite as truly as his papal ancestor had made his family though he could scarce see what she had made it for unless because she too was perversely romantic he had neither bribed nor persuaded her had given her nothing scarce even till now articulate thanks so that her profit to think of it vulgarly must have all had to come from the ververs yet he was far he could still remind himself from supposing that she had been grossly remunerated he was wholly sure she hadn t for if there were people who took presents and people who didn t she would be quite on the right side and of the proud class only then on the other hand her disinterestedness was rather awful it implied that is such abysses of confidence she was admirably attached to maggie whose possession of such a friend might moreover quite rank as one of her assets but the great proof of her affection had been in bringing them with her design together meeting him during a winter in rome meeting him afterwards in paris and liking him as she had in time frankly let him know from the first she had marked him for her young friend s own and had then unmistakably presented him in a light but the interest in maggie that was the point would have achieved but little without her interest in him on what did that sentiment unsolicited and unrecompensed rest what good again for it was much like his question about mr verver should he ever have done her the prince s notion of a recompense to women similar in this to his notion of an appeal was more or less to make love to them now he hadn t as he believed made love the least little bit to mrs assingham nor did he think she had for a moment supposed it he liked in these days to mark them off the women to whom he hadn t made love it represented and that was what pleased him in it a different stage of existence from the time at which he liked to mark off the women to whom he had neither with all this had mrs assingham herself been either aggressive or resentful on what occasion ever had she appeared to find him wanting these things the motives of such people were obscure a little alarmingly so they contributed to that element of the impenetrable which alone slightly qualified his sense of his good fortune he remembered to have read as a boy a wonderful tale by allan poe his prospective wife s countryman which was a thing to show by the way what imagination americans could have the story of the shipwrecked gordon pym who drifting in a small boat further toward the north pole or was it the south than anyone had ever done found at a given moment before him a thickness of white air that was like a dazzling curtain of light concealing as darkness conceals yet of the colour of milk or of snow there were moments when he felt his own boat move upon some such mystery the state of mind of his new friends including mrs assingham herself had resemblances to a great white curtain he had never known curtains but as purple even to blackness but as producing where they hung a darkness intended and ominous when they were so disposed as to shelter surprises the surprises were apt to be shocks shocks however from these quite different depths were not what he saw reason to apprehend what he rather seemed to himself not yet to have measured was something that seeking a name for it he would have called the quantity of confidence reposed in him he had stood still at many a moment of the previous month with the thought freshly determined or renewed of the general expectation to define it roughly of which he was the subject what was singular was that it seemed not so much an expectation of anything in particular as a large bland blank assumption of merits almost beyond notation of essential quality and value it was as if he had been some old embossed coin of a purity of gold no longer used stamped with glorious arms mediaeval wonderful of which the worth in mere modern change sovereigns and half crowns would be great enough but as to which since there were finer ways of using it such taking to pieces was superfluous that was the image for the security in which it was open to him to rest he was to constitute a possession yet was to escape being reduced to his component parts what would this mean but that practically he was never to be tried or tested what would it mean but that if they didn t change him they really wouldn t know he wouldn t know himself how many pounds shillings and pence he had to give these at any rate for the present were unanswerable questions all that was before him was that he was invested with attributes he was taken seriously lost there in the white mist was the seriousness in them that made them so take him it was even in mrs assingham in spite of her having as she had frequently shown a more mocking spirit all he could say as yet was that he had done nothing so far as to break any charm what should he do if he were to ask her frankly this afternoon what was morally speaking behind their veil it would come to asking what they expected him to do she would answer him probably oh you know it s what we expect you to be on which he would have no resource but to deny his knowledge would that break the spell his saying he had no idea what idea in fact could he have he also took himself seriously made a point of it but it wasn t simply a question of fancy and pretension his own estimate he saw ways at one time and another of dealing with but theirs sooner or later say what they might would put him to the practical proof as the practical proof accordingly would naturally be proportionate to the cluster of his attributes one arrived at a scale that he was not honestly the man to calculate who but a billionaire could say what was fair exchange for a billion that measure was the shrouded object but he felt really as his cab stopped in cadogan place a little nearer the shroud he promised himself virtually to give the latter a twitch ii they re not good days you know he had said to fanny assingham after declaring himself grateful for finding her and then with his cup of tea putting her in possession of the latest news the documents signed an hour ago de part et d autre and the telegram from his backers who had reached paris the morning before and who pausing there a little poor dears seemed to think the whole thing a tremendous lark we re very simple folk mere country cousins compared with you he had also observed and paris for my sister and her husband is the end of the world london therefore will be more or less another planet it has always been as with so many of us quite their mecca but this is their first real caravan they ve mainly known old england as a shop for articles in india rubber and leather in which they ve dressed themselves as much as possible which all means however that you ll see them all of them wreathed in smiles we must be very easy with them maggie s too wonderful her preparations are on a scale she insists on taking in the sposi and my uncle the others will come to me i ve been engaging their rooms at the hotel and with all those solemn signatures of an hour ago that brings the case home to me do you mean you re afraid his hostess had amusedly asked terribly afraid i ve now but to wait to see the monster come they re not good days they re neither one thing nor the other i ve really got nothing yet i ve everything to lose one doesn t know what still may happen the way she laughed at him was for an instant almost irritating it came out for his fancy from behind the white curtain it was a sign that is of her deep serenity which worried instead of soothing him and to be soothed after all to be tided over in his mystic impatience to be told what he could understand and believe that was what he had come for marriage then said mrs assingham is what you call the monster i admit it s a fearful thing at the best but for heaven s sake if that s what you re thinking of don t run away from it ah to run away from it would be to run away from you the prince replied and i ve already told you often enough how i depend on you to see me through he so liked the way she took this from the corner of her sofa that he gave his sincerity for it was sincerity fuller expression i m starting on the great voyage across the unknown sea my ship s all rigged and appointed the cargo s stowed away and the company complete but what seems the matter with me is that i can t sail alone my ship must be one of a pair must have in the waste of waters a what do you call it a consort i don t ask you to stay on board with me but i must keep your sail in sight for orientation i don t in the least myself know i assure you the points of the compass but with a lead i can perfectly follow you must be my lead how can you be sure she asked where i should take you why from your having brought me safely thus far i should never have got here without you you ve provided the ship itself and if you ve not quite seen me aboard you ve attended me ever so kindly to the dock your own vessel is all conveniently in the next berth and you can t desert me now she showed him again her amusement which struck him even as excessive as if to his surprise he made her also a little nervous she treated him in fine as if he were not uttering truths but making pretty figures for her diversion my vessel dear prince she smiled what vessel in the world have i this little house is all our ship bob s and mine and thankful we are now to have it we ve wandered far living as you may say from hand to mouth without rest for the soles of our feet but the time has come for us at last to draw in he made at this the young man an indignant protest you talk about rest it s too selfish when you re just launching me on adventures she shook her head with her kind lucidity not adventures heaven forbid you ve had yours as i ve had mine and my idea has been all along that we should neither of us begin again my own last precisely has been doing for you all you so prettily mention but it consists simply in having conducted you to rest you talk about ships but they re not the comparison your tossings are over you re practically in port the port she concluded of the golden isles he looked about to put himself more in relation with the place then after an hesitation seemed to speak certain words instead of certain others oh i know where i am i do decline to be left but what i came for of course was to thank you if to day has seemed for the first time the end of preliminaries i feel how little there would have been any at all without you the first were wholly yours well said mrs assingham they were remarkably easy i ve seen them i ve had them she smiled more difficult everything you must feel went of itself so you must feel everything still goes the prince quickly agreed oh beautifully but you had the conception ah prince so had you he looked at her harder a moment you had it first you had it most she returned his look as if it had made her wonder i liked it if that s what you mean but you liked it surely yourself i protest that i had easy work with you i had only at last when i thought it was time to speak for you all that is quite true but you re leaving me all the same you re leaving me you re washing your hands of me he went on however that won t be easy i won t be left and he had turned his eyes about again taking in the pretty room that she had just described as her final refuge the place of peace for a world worn couple to which she had lately retired with bob i shall keep this spot in sight say what you will i shall need you i m not you know he declared going to give you up for anybody if you re afraid which of course you re not are you trying to make me the same she asked after a moment he waited a minute too then answered her with a question you say you liked it your undertaking to make my engagement possible it remains beautiful for me that you did it s charming and unforgettable but still more it s mysterious and wonderful why you dear delightful woman did you like it i scarce know what to make she said of such an inquiry if you haven t by this time found out yourself what meaning can anything i say have for you don t you really after all feel she added while nothing came from him aren t you conscious every minute of the perfection of the creature of whom i ve put you into possession every minute gratefully conscious but that s exactly the ground of my question it wasn t only a matter of your handing me over it was a matter of your handing her it was a matter of her fate still more than of mine you thought all the good of her that one woman can think of another and yet by your account you enjoyed assisting at her risk she had kept her eyes on him while he spoke and this was what visibly determined a repetition for her are you trying to frighten me ah that s a foolish view i should be too vulgar you apparently can t understand either my good faith or my humility i m awfully humble the young man insisted that s the way i ve been feeling to day with everything so finished and ready and you won t take me for serious she continued to face him as if he really troubled her a little oh you deep old italians there you are he returned it s what i wanted you to come to that s the responsible note yes she went on if you re humble you must be dangerous she had a pause while he only smiled then she said i don t in the least want to lose sight of you but even if i did i shouldn t think it right thank you for that it s what i needed of you i m sure after all that the more you re with me the more i shall understand it s the only thing in the world i want i m excellent i really think all round except that i m stupid i can do pretty well anything i see but i ve got to see it first and he pursued his demonstration i don t in the least mind its having to be shown me in fact i like that better therefore it is that i want that i shall always want your eyes through them i wish to look even at any risk of their showing me what i mayn t like for then he wound up i shall know and of that i shall never be afraid she might quite have been waiting to see what he would come to but she spoke with a certain impatience what on earth are you talking about but he could perfectly say of my real honest fear of being off some day of being wrong without knowing it that s what i shall always trust you for to tell me when i am no with you people it s a sense we haven t got it not as you have therefore but he had said enough ecco he simply smiled it was not to be concealed that he worked upon her but of course she had always liked him i should be interested she presently remarked to see some sense you don t possess well he produced one on the spot the moral dear mrs assingham i mean always as you others consider it i ve of course something that in our poor dear backward old rome sufficiently passes for it but it s no more like yours than the tortuous stone staircase half ruined into the bargain in some castle of our quattrocento is like the lightning elevator in one of mr verver s fifteen storey buildings your moral sense works by steam it sends you up like a rocket ours is slow and steep and unlighted with so many of the steps missing that well that it s as short in almost any case to turn round and come down again trusting mrs assingham smiled to get up some other way yes or not to have to get up at all however he added i told you that at the beginning machiavelli she simply exclaimed you do me too much honour i wish indeed i had his genius however if you really believe i have his perversity you wouldn t say it but it s all right he gaily enough concluded i shall always have you to come to on this for a little they sat face to face after which without comment she asked him if he would have more tea all she would give him he promptly signified and he developed making her laugh his idea that the tea of the english race was somehow their morality made with boiling water in a little pot so that the more of it one drank the more moral one would become his drollery served as a transition and she put to him several questions about his sister and the others questions as to what bob in particular colonel assingham her husband could do for the arriving gentlemen whom by the prince s leave he would immediately go to see he was funny while they talked about his own people too whom he described with anecdotes of their habits imitations of their manners and prophecies of their conduct as more rococo than anything cadogan place would ever have known this mrs assingham professed was exactly what would endear them to her and that in turn drew from her visitor a fresh declaration of all the comfort of his being able so to depend on her he had been with her at this point some twenty minutes but he had paid her much longer visits and he stayed now as if to make his attitude prove his appreciation he stayed moreover that was really the sign of the hour in spite of the nervous unrest that had brought him and that had in truth much rather fed on the scepticism by which she had apparently meant to soothe it she had not soothed him and there arrived remarkably a moment when the cause of her failure gleamed out he had not frightened her as she called it he felt that yet she was herself not at ease she had been nervous though trying to disguise it the sight of him following on the announcement of his name had shown her as disconcerted this conviction for the young man deepened and sharpened yet with the effect too of making him glad in spite of it it was as if in calling he had done even better than he intended for it was somehow important that was what it was that there should be at this hour something the matter with mrs assingham with whom in all their acquaintance so considerable now there had never been the least little thing the matter to wait thus and watch for it was to know of a truth that there was something the matter with him since strangely with so little to go upon his heart had positively begun to beat to the tune of suspense it fairly befell at last for a climax that they almost ceased to pretend to pretend that is to cheat each other with forms the unspoken had come up and there was a crisis neither could have said how long it lasted during which they were reduced for all interchange to looking at each other on quite an inordinate scale they might at this moment in their positively portentous stillness have been keeping it up for a wager sitting for their photograph or even enacting a tableau vivant the spectator of whom they would thus well have been worthy might have read meanings of his own into the intensity of their communion or indeed even without meanings have found his account aesthetically in some gratified play of our modern sense of type so scantly to be distinguished from our modern sense of beauty type was there at the worst in mrs assingham s dark neat head on which the crisp black hair made waves so fine and so numerous that she looked even more in the fashion of the hour than she desired full of discriminations against the obvious she had yet to accept a flagrant appearance and to make the best of misleading signs her richness of hue her generous nose her eyebrows marked like those of an actress these things with an added amplitude of person on which middle age had set its seal seemed to present her insistently as a daughter of the south or still more of the east a creature formed by hammocks and divans fed upon sherbets and waited upon by slaves she looked as if her most active effort might be to take up as she lay back her mandolin or to share a sugared fruit with a pet gazelle she was in fact however neither a pampered jewess nor a lazy creole new york had been recordedly her birthplace and europe punctually her discipline she wore yellow and purple because she thought it better as she said while one was about it to look like the queen of sheba than like a revendeuse she put pearls in her hair and crimson and gold in her tea gown for the same reason it was her theory that nature itself had overdressed her and that her only course was to drown as it was hopeless to try to chasten the overdressing so she was covered and surrounded with things which were frankly toys and shams a part of the amusement with which she rejoiced to supply her friends these friends were in the game that of playing with the disparity between her aspect and her character her character was attested by the second movement of her face which convinced the beholder that her vision of the humours of the world was not supine not passive she enjoyed she needed the warm air of friendship but the eyes of the american city looked out somehow for the opportunity of it from under the lids of jerusalem with her false indolence in short her false leisure her false pearls and palms and courts and fountains she was a person for whom life was multitudinous detail detail that left her as it at any moment found her unappalled and unwearied sophisticated as i may appear it was her frequent phrase she had found sympathy her best resource it gave her plenty to do it made her as she also said sit up she had in her life two great holes to fill and she described herself as dropping social scraps into them as she had known old ladies in her early american time drop morsels of silk into the baskets in which they collected the material for some eventual patchwork quilt one of these gaps in mrs assingham s completeness was her want of children the other was her want of wealth it was wonderful how little either in the fulness of time came to show sympathy and curiosity could render their objects practically filial just as an english husband who in his military years had run everything in his regiment could make economy blossom like the rose colonel bob had a few years after his marriage left the army which had clearly by that time done its laudable all for the enrichment of his personal experience and he could thus give his whole time to the gardening in question there reigned among the younger friends of this couple a legend almost too venerable for historical criticism that the marriage itself the happiest of its class dated from the far twilight of the age a primitive period when such things such things as american girls accepted as good enough had not begun to be so that the pleasant pair had been as to the risk taken on either side bold and original honourably marked for the evening of life as discoverers of a kind of hymeneal northwest passage mrs assingham knew better knew there had been no historic hour from that of pocahontas down when some young englishman hadn t precipitately believed and some american girl hadn t with a few more gradations availed herself to the full of her incapacity to doubt but she accepted resignedly the laurel of the founder since she was in fact pretty well the doyenne above ground of her transplanted tribe and since above all she had invented combinations though she had not invented bob s own it was he who had done that absolutely puzzled it out by himself from his first odd glimmer resting upon it moreover through the years to come as proof enough in him by itself of the higher cleverness if she kept her own cleverness up it was largely that he should have full credit there were moments in truth when she privately felt how little striking out as he had done he could have afforded that she should show the common limits but mrs assingham s cleverness was in truth tested when her present visitor at last said to her i don t think you know that you re treating me quite right you ve something on your mind that you don t tell me it was positive too that her smile in reply was a trifle dim am i obliged to tell you everything i have on my mind it isn t a question of everything but it s a question of anything that may particularly concern me then you shouldn t keep it back you know with what care i desire to proceed taking everything into account and making no mistake that may possibly injure her mrs assingham at this had after an instant an odd interrogation her her and him both our friends either maggie or her father i have something on my mind mrs assingham presently returned something has happened for which i hadn t been prepared but it isn t anything that properly concerns you the prince with immediate gaiety threw back his head what do you mean by properly i somehow see volumes in it it s the way people put a thing when they put it well wrong i put things right what is it that has happened for me his hostess the next moment had drawn spirit from his tone oh i shall be delighted if you ll take your share of it charlotte stant is in london she has just been here miss stant oh really the prince expressed clear surprise a transparency through which his eyes met his friend s with a certain hardness of concussion she has arrived from america he then quickly asked she appears to have arrived this noon coming up from southampton at an hotel she dropped upon me after luncheon and was here for more than an hour the young man heard with interest though not with an interest too great for his gaiety you think then i ve a share in it what is my share why any you like the one you seemed just now eager to take it was you yourself who insisted he looked at her on this with conscious inconsistency and she could now see that he had changed colour but he was always easy i didn t know then what the matter was you didn t think it could be so bad do you call it very bad the young man asked only she smiled because that s the way it seems to affect you he hesitated still with the trace of his quickened colour still looking at her still adjusting his manner but you allowed you were upset to the extent yes of not having in the least looked for her any more said mrs assingham than i judge maggie to have done the prince thought then as if glad to be able to say something very natural and true no quite right maggie hasn t looked for her but i m sure he added she ll be delighted to see her that certainly and his hostess spoke with a different shade of gravity she ll be quite overjoyed the prince went on has miss stant now gone to her she has gone back to her hotel to bring her things here i can t have her said mrs assingham alone at an hotel no i see if she s here at all she must stay with me he quite took it in so she s coming now i expect her at any moment if you wait you ll see her oh he promptly declared charming but this word came out as if a little in sudden substitution for some other it sounded accidental whereas he wished to be firm that accordingly was what he next showed himself if it wasn t for what s going on these next days maggie would certainly want to have her in fact he lucidly continued isn t what s happening just a reason to make her want to mrs assingham for answer only looked at him and this the next instant had apparently had more effect than if she had spoken for he asked a question that seemed incongruous what has she come for it made his companion laugh why for just what you say for your marriage mine he wondered maggie s it s the same thing it s for your great event and then said mrs assingham she s so lonely has she given you that as a reason i scarcely remember she gave me so many she abounds poor dear in reasons but there s one that whatever she does i always remember for myself and which is that he looked as if he ought to guess but couldn t why the fact that she has no home absolutely none whatever she s extraordinarily alone again he took it in and also has no great means very small ones which is not however with the expense of railways and hotels a reason for her running to and fro on the contrary but she doesn t like her country hers my dear man it s little enough hers the attribution for the moment amused his hostess she has rebounded now but she has had little enough else to do with it oh i say hers the prince pleasantly explained very much as at this time of day i might say mine i quite feel i assure you as if the great place already more or less belonged to me that s your good fortune and your point of view you own or you soon practically will own so much of it charlotte owns almost nothing in the world she tells me but two colossal trunks only one of which i have given her leave to introduce into this house she ll depreciate to you mrs assingham added your property he thought of these things he thought of every thing but he had always his resource at hand of turning all to the easy has she come with designs upon me and then in a moment as if even this were almost too grave he sounded the note that had least to do with himself est elle toujours aussi belle that was the furthest point somehow to which charlotte stant could be relegated mrs assingham treated it freely just the same the person in the world to my sense whose looks are most subject to appreciation it s all in the way she affects you one admires her if one doesn t happen not to so as well one criticises her ah that s not fair said the prince to criticise her then there you are you re answered i m answered he took it humorously as his lesson sank his previous self consciousness with excellent effect in grateful docility i only meant that there are perhaps better things to be done with miss stant than to criticise her when once you begin that with anyone he was vague and kind i quite agree that it s better to keep out of it as long as one can but when one must do it yes he asked as she paused then know what you mean i see perhaps he smiled i don t know what i mean well it s what just now in all ways you particularly should know mrs assingham however made no more of this having before anything else apparently a scruple about the tone she had just used i quite understand of course that given her great friendship with maggie she should have wanted to be present she has acted impulsively but she has acted generously she has acted beautifully said the prince i say generously because i mean she hasn t in any way counted the cost she ll have it to count in a manner now his hostess continued but that doesn t matter he could see how little you ll look after her i ll look after her so it s all right it s all right said mrs assingham then why are you troubled it pulled her up but only for a minute i m not any more than you the prince s dark blue eyes were of the finest and on occasion precisely resembled nothing so much as the high windows of a roman palace of an historic front by one of the great old designers thrown open on a feast day to the golden air his look itself at such times suggested an image that of some very noble personage who expected acclaimed by the crowd in the street and with old precious stuffs falling over the sill for his support had gaily and gallantly come to show himself always moreover less in his own interest than in that of spectators and subjects whose need to admire even to gape was periodically to be considered the young man s expression became after this fashion something vivid and concrete a beautiful personal presence that of a prince in very truth a ruler warrior patron lighting up brave architecture and diffusing the sense of a function it had been happily said of his face that the figure thus appearing in the great frame was the ghost of some proudest ancestor whoever the ancestor now at all events the prince was for mrs assingham s benefit in view of the people he seemed leaning on crimson damask to take in the bright day he looked younger than his years he was beautiful innocent vague oh well i m not he rang out clear i should like to see you sir she said for you wouldn t have a shadow of excuse he showed how he agreed that he would have been at a loss for one and the fact of their serenity was thus made as important as if some danger of its opposite had directly menaced them the only thing was that if the evidence of their cheer was so established mrs assingham had a little to explain her original manner and she came to this before they dropped the question my first impulse is always to behave about everything as if i feared complications but i don t fear them i really like them they re quite my element he deferred for her to this account of herself but still he said if we re not in the presence of a complication she hesitated a handsome clever odd girl staying with one is always a complication the young man weighed it almost as if the question were new to him and will she stay very long his friend gave a laugh how in the world can i know i ve scarcely asked her ah yes you can t but something in the tone of it amused her afresh do you think you could i he wondered do you think you could get it out of her for me the probable length of her stay he rose bravely enough to the occasion and the challenge i daresay if you were to give me the chance here it is then for you she answered for she had heard within the minute the stop of a cab at her door she s back iii it had been said as a joke but as after this they awaited their friend in silence the effect of the silence was to turn the time to gravity a gravity not dissipated even when the prince next spoke he had been thinking the case over and making up his mind a handsome clever odd girl staying with one was a complication mrs assingham so far was right but there were the facts the good relations from schooldays of the two young women and the clear confidence with which one of them had arrived she can come you know at any time to us mrs assingham took it up with an irony beyond laughter you d like her for your honeymoon oh no you must keep her for that but why not after she had looked at him a minute then at the sound of a voice in the corridor they had got up why not you re splendid charlotte stant the next minute was with them ushered in as she had alighted from her cab and prepared for not finding mrs assingham alone this would have been to be noticed by the butler s answer on the stairs to a question put to him she could have looked at her hostess with such straightness and brightness only from knowing that the prince was also there the discrimination of but a moment yet which let him take her in still better than if she had instantly faced him he availed himself of the chance thus given him for he was conscious of all these things what he accordingly saw for some seconds with intensity was a tall strong charming girl who wore for him at first exactly the look of her adventurous situation a suggestion in all her person in motion and gesture in free vivid yet altogether happy indications of dress from the becoming compactness of her hat to the shade of tan in her shoes of winds and waves and custom houses of far countries and long journeys the knowledge of how and where and the habit founded on experience of not being afraid he was aware at the same time that of this combination the strongminded note was not as might have been apprehended the basis he was now sufficiently familiar with english speaking types he had sounded attentively enough such possibilities for a quick vision of differences he had besides his own view of this young lady s strength of mind it was great he had ground to believe but it would never interfere with the play of her extremely personal her always amusing taste this last was the thing in her for she threw it out positively on the spot like a light that she might have reappeared during these moments just to cool his worried eyes with he saw her in her light that immediate exclusive address to their friend was like a lamp she was holding aloft for his benefit and for his pleasure it showed him everything above all her presence in the world so closely so irretrievably contemporaneous with his own a sharp sharp fact sharper during these instants than any other at all even than that of his marriage but accompanied in a subordinate and controlled way with those others facial physiognomic that mrs assingham had been speaking of as subject to appreciation so they were these others as he met them again and that was the connection they instantly established with him if they had to be interpreted this made at least for intimacy there was but one way certainly for him to interpret them in the sense of the already known making use then of clumsy terms of excess the face was too narrow and too long the eyes not large and the mouth on the other hand by no means small with substance in its lips and a slight the very slightest tendency to protrusion in the solid teeth otherwise indeed well arrayed and flashingly white but it was strangely as a cluster of possessions of his own that these things in charlotte stant now affected him items in a full list items recognised each of them as if for the long interval they had been stored wrapped up numbered put away in a cabinet while she faced mrs assingham the door of the cabinet had opened of itself he took the relics out one by one and it was more and more each instant as if she were giving him time he saw again that her thick hair was vulgarly speaking brown but that there was a shade of tawny autumn leaf in it for appreciation a colour indescribable and of which he had known no other case something that gave her at moments the sylvan head of a huntress he saw the sleeves of her jacket drawn to her wrists but he again made out the free arms within them to be of the completely rounded the polished slimness that florentine sculptors in the great time had loved and of which the apparent firmness is expressed in their old silver and old bronze he knew her narrow hands he knew her long fingers and the shape and colour of her finger nails he knew her special beauty of movement and line when she turned her back and the perfect working of all her main attachments that of some wonderful finished instrument something intently made for exhibition for a prize he knew above all the extraordinary fineness of her flexible waist the stem of an expanded flower which gave her a likeness also to some long loose silk purse well filled with gold pieces but having been passed empty through a finger ring that held it together it was as if before she turned to him he had weighed the whole thing in his open palm and even heard a little the chink of the metal when she did turn to him it was to recognise with her eyes what he might have been doing she made no circumstance of thus coming upon him save so far as the intelligence in her face could at any moment make a circumstance of almost anything if when she moved off she looked like a huntress she looked when she came nearer like his notion perhaps not wholly correct of a muse but what she said was simply you see you re not rid of me how is dear maggie it was to come soon enough by the quite unforced operation of chance the young man s opportunity to ask her the question suggested by mrs assingham shortly before her entrance the license had he chosen to embrace it was within a few minutes all there the license given him literally to inquire of this young lady how long she was likely to be with them for a matter of the mere domestic order had quickly determined on mrs assingham s part a withdrawal of a few moments which had the effect of leaving her visitors free mrs betterman s there she had said to charlotte in allusion to some member of the household who was to have received her and seen her belongings settled to which charlotte had replied that she had encountered only the butler who had been quite charming she had deprecated any action taken on behalf of her effects but her hostess rebounding from accumulated cushions evidently saw more in mrs betterman s non appearance than could meet the casual eye what she saw in short demanded her intervention in spite of an earnest let me go from the girl and a prolonged smiling wail over the trouble she was giving the prince was quite aware at this moment that departure for himself was indicated the question of miss stant s installation didn t demand his presence it was a case for one to go away if one hadn t a reason for staying he had a reason however of that he was equally aware and he had not for a good while done anything more conscious and intentional than not quickly to take leave his visible insistence for it came to that even demanded of him a certain disagreeable effort the sort of effort he had mostly associated with acting for an idea his idea was there his idea was to find out something something he wanted much to know and to find it out not tomorrow not at some future time not in short with waiting and wondering but if possible before quitting the place this particular curiosity moreover confounded itself a little with the occasion offered him to satisfy mrs assingham s own he wouldn t have admitted that he was staying to ask a rude question there was distinctly nothing rude in his having his reasons it would be rude for that matter to turn one s back without a word or two on an old friend well as it came to pass he got the word or two for mrs assingham s preoccupation was practically simplifying the little crisis was of shorter duration than our account of it duration naturally would have forced him to take up his hat he was somehow glad on finding himself alone with charlotte that he had not been guilty of that inconsequence not to be flurried was the kind of consistency he wanted just as consistency was the kind of dignity and why couldn t he have dignity when he had so much of the good conscience as it were on which such advantages rested he had done nothing he oughtn t he had in fact done nothing at all once more as a man conscious of having known many women he could assist as he would have called it at the recurrent the predestined phenomenon the thing always as certain as sunrise or the coming round of saints days the doing by the woman of the thing that gave her away she did it ever inevitably infallibly she couldn t possibly not do it it was her nature it was her life and the man could always expect it without lifting a finger this was his the man s any man s position and strength that he had necessarily the advantage that he only had to wait with a decent patience to be placed in spite of himself it might really be said in the right just so the punctuality of performance on the part of the other creature was her weakness and her deep misfortune not less no doubt than her beauty it produced for the man that extraordinary mixture of pity and profit in which his relation with her when he was not a mere brute mainly consisted and gave him in fact his most pertinent ground of being always nice to her nice about her nice for her she always dressed her act up of course she muffled and disguised and arranged it showing in fact in these dissimulations a cleverness equal to but one thing in the world equal to her abjection she would let it be known for anything for everything but the truth of which it was made that was what precisely charlotte stant would be doing now that was the present motive and support to a certainty of each of her looks and motions she was the twentieth woman she was possessed by her doom but her doom was also to arrange appearances and what now concerned him was to learn how she proposed he would help her would arrange with her to any point in reason the only thing was to know what appearance could best be produced and best be preserved produced and preserved on her part of course since on his own there had been luckily no folly to cover up nothing but a perfect accord between conduct and obligation they stood there together at all events when the door had closed behind their friend with a conscious strained smile and very much as if each waited for the other to strike the note or give the pitch the young man held himself in his silent suspense only not more afraid because he felt her own fear she was afraid of herself however whereas to his gain of lucidity he was afraid only of her would she throw herself into his arms or would she be otherwise wonderful she would see what he would do so their queer minute without words told him and she would act accordingly but what could he do but just let her see that he would make anything everything for her as honourably easy as possible even if she should throw herself into his arms he would make that easy easy that is to overlook to ignore not to remember and not by the same token either to regret this was not what in fact happened though it was also not at a single touch but by the finest gradations that his tension subsided it s too delightful to be back she said at last and it was all she definitely gave him being moreover nothing but what anyone else might have said yet with two or three other things that on his response followed it it quite pointed the path while the tone of it and her whole attitude were as far removed as need have been from the truth of her situation the abjection that was present to him as of the essence quite failed to peep out and he soon enough saw that if she was arranging she could be trusted to arrange good it was all he asked and all the more that he could admire and like her for it the particular appearance she would as they said go in for was that of having no account whatever to give him it would be in fact that of having none to give anybody of reasons or of motives of comings or of goings she was a charming young woman who had met him before but she was also a charming young woman with a life of her own she would take it high up up up ever so high well then he would do the same no height would be too great for them not even the dizziest conceivable to a young person so subtle the dizziest seemed indeed attained when after another moment she came as near as she was to come to an apology for her abruptness i ve been thinking of maggie and at last i yearned for her i wanted to see her happy and it doesn t strike me i find you too shy to tell me i shall of course she s happy thank god only it s almost terrible you know the happiness of young good generous creatures it rather frightens one but the blessed virgin and all the saints said the prince have her in their keeping certainly they have she s the dearest of the dear but i needn t tell you the girl added ah he returned with gravity i feel that i ve still much to learn about her to which he subjoined she ll rejoice awfully in your being with us oh you don t need me charlotte smiled it s her hour it s a great hour one has seen often enough with girls what it is but that she said is exactly why why i ve wanted i mean not to miss it he bent on her a kind comprehending face you mustn t miss anything he had got it the pitch and he could keep it now for all he had needed was to have it given him the pitch was the happiness of his wife that was to be the sight of that happiness as a joy for an old friend it was yes magnificent and not the less so for its coming to him suddenly as sincere as nobly exalted something in charlotte s eyes seemed to tell him this seemed to plead with him in advance as to what he was to find in it he was eager and he tried to show her that too to find what she liked mindful as he easily could be of what the friendship had been for maggie it had been armed with the wings of young imagination young generosity it had been he believed always counting out her intense devotion to her father the liveliest emotion she had known before the dawn of the sentiment inspired by himself she had not to his knowledge invited the object of it to their wedding had not thought of proposing to her for a matter of a couple of hours an arduous and expensive journey but she had kept her connected and informed from week to week in spite of preparations and absorptions oh i ve been writing to charlotte i wish you knew her better he could still hear from recent weeks this record of the fact just as he could still be conscious not otherwise than queerly of the gratuitous element in maggie s wish which he had failed as yet to indicate to her older and perhaps more intelligent at any rate why shouldn t charlotte respond and be quite free to respond to such fidelities with something more than mere formal good manners the relations of women with each other were of the strangest it was true and he probably wouldn t have trusted here a young person of his own race he was proceeding throughout on the ground of the immense difference difficult indeed as it might have been to disembroil in this young person her race quality nothing in her definitely placed her she was a rare a special product her singleness her solitude her want of means that is her want of ramifications and other advantages contributed to enrich her somehow with an odd precious neutrality to constitute for her so detached yet so aware a sort of small social capital it was the only one she had it was the only one a lonely gregarious girl could have since few surely had in anything like the same degree arrived at it and since this one indeed had compassed it but through the play of some gift of nature to which you could scarce give a definite name it wasn t a question of her strange sense for tongues with which she juggled as a conjuror at a show juggled with balls or hoops or lighted brands it wasn t at least entirely that for he had known people almost as polyglot whom their accomplishment had quite failed to make interesting he was polyglot himself for that matter as was the case too with so many of his friends and relations for none of whom more than for himself was it anything but a common convenience the point was that in this young woman it was a beauty in itself and almost a mystery so certainly he had more than once felt in noting on her lips that rarest among the barbarians of all civil graces a perfect felicity in the use of italian he had known strangers a few and mostly men who spoke his own language agreeably but he had known neither man nor woman who showed for it charlotte s almost mystifying instinct he remembered how from the first of their acquaintance she had made no display of it quite as if english between them his english so matching with hers were their inevitable medium he had perceived all by accident by hearing her talk before him to somebody else that they had an alternative as good an alternative in fact as much better as the amusement for him was greater in watching her for the slips that never came her account of the mystery didn t suffice her recall of her birth in florence and florentine childhood her parents from the great country but themselves already of a corrupt generation demoralised falsified polyglot well before her with the tuscan balia who was her first remembrance the servants of the villa the dear contadini of the poder the little girls and the other peasants of the next podere all the rather shabby but still ever so pretty human furniture of her early time including the good sisters of the poor convent of the tuscan hills the convent shabbier than almost anything else but prettier too in which she had been kept at school till the subsequent phase the phase of the much grander institution in paris at which maggie was to arrive terribly frightened and as a smaller girl three years before her own ending of her period of five such reminiscences naturally gave a ground but they had not prevented him from insisting that some strictly civil ancestor generations back and from the tuscan hills if she would made himself felt ineffaceably in her blood and in her tone she knew nothing of the ancestor but she had taken his theory from him gracefully enough as one of the little presents that make friendship flourish these matters however all melted together now though a sense of them was doubtless concerned not unnaturally in the next thing of the nature of a surmise that his discretion let him articulate you haven t i rather gather particularly liked your country they would stick for the time to their english it doesn t i fear seem particularly mine and it doesn t in the least matter over there whether one likes it or not that is to anyone but one s self but i didn t like it said charlotte stant that s not encouraging then to me is it the prince went on do you mean because you re going oh yes of course we re going i ve wanted immensely to go she hesitated but now immediately in a month or two it seems to be the new idea on which there was something in her face as he imagined that made him say didn t maggie write to you not of your going at once but of course you must go and of course you must stay charlotte was easily clear as long as possible is that what you did he laughed you stayed as long as possible well it seemed to me so but i hadn t interests you ll have them on a great scale it s the country for interests said charlotte if i had only had a few i doubtless wouldn t have left it he waited an instant they were still on their feet yours then are rather here oh mine the girl smiled they take up little room wherever they are it determined in him the way this came from her and what it somehow did for her it determined in him a speech that would have seemed a few minutes before precarious and in questionable taste the lead she had given him made the difference and he felt it as really a lift on finding an honest and natural word rise by its license to his lips nothing surely could be for both of them more in the note of a high bravery i ve been thinking it all the while so probable you know that you would have seen your way to marrying she looked at him an instant and just for these seconds he feared for what he might have spoiled to marrying whom why some good kind clever rich american again his security hung in the balance then she was as he felt admirable i tried everyone i came across i did my best i showed i had come quite publicly for that perhaps i showed it too much at any rate it was no use i had to recognise it no one would have me then she seemed to show as sorry for his having to hear of her anything so disconcerting she pitied his feeling about it if he was disappointed she would cheer him up existence you know all the same doesn t depend on that i mean she smiled on having caught a husband oh existence the prince vaguely commented you think i ought to argue for more than mere existence she asked i don t see why my existence even reduced as much as you like to being merely mine should be so impossible there are things of sorts i should be able to have things i should be able to be the position of a single woman to day is very favourable you know favourable to what why just to existence which may contain after all in one way and another so much it may contain at the worst even affections affections in fact quite particularly fixed that is on one s friends i m extremely fond of maggie for instance i quite adore her how could i adore her more if i were married to one of the people you speak of the prince gave a laugh you might adore him more ah but it isn t is it she asked a question of that my dear friend he returned it s always a question of doing the best for one s self one can without injury to others he felt by this time that they were indeed on an excellent basis so he went on again as if to show frankly his sense of its firmness i venture therefore to repeat my hope that you ll marry some capital fellow and also to repeat my belief that such a marriage will be more favourable to you as you call it than even the spirit of the age she looked at him at first only for answer and would have appeared to take it with meekness had she not perhaps appeared a little more to take it with gaiety thank you very much she simply said but at that moment their friend was with them again it was undeniable that as she came in mrs assingham looked with a certain smiling sharpness from one of them to the other the perception of which was perhaps what led charlotte for reassurance to pass the question on the prince hopes so much i shall still marry some good person whether it worked for mrs assingham or not the prince was himself at this more than ever reassured he was safe in a word that was what it all meant and he had required to be safe he was really safe enough for almost any joke it s only he explained to their hostess because of what miss stant has been telling me don t we want to keep up her courage if the joke was broad he had at least not begun it not that is as a joke which was what his companion s address to their friend made of it she has been trying in america she says but hasn t brought it off the tone was somehow not what mrs assingham had expected but she made the best of it well then she replied to the young man if you take such an interest you must bring it off and you must help dear charlotte said unperturbed as you ve helped so beautifully in such things before with which before mrs assingham could meet the appeal she had addressed herself to the prince on a matter much nearer to him your mar riage is on friday on saturday oh on friday no for what do you take us there s not a vulgar omen we re neglecting on saturday please at the oratory at three o clock before twelve assistants exactly twelve including me it struck him he laughed you ll make the thirteenth it won t do not said charlotte if you re going in for omens should you like me to stay away dear no we ll manage we ll make the round number we ll have in some old woman they must keep them there for that don t they mrs assingham s return had at last indicated for him his departure he had possessed himself again of his hat and approached her to take leave but he had another word for charlotte i dine to night with mr verver have you any message the girl seemed to wonder a little for mr verver for maggie about her seeing you early that i know is what she ll like then i ll come early thanks i daresay he went on she ll send for you i mean send a carriage oh i don t require that thanks i can go for a penny can t i she asked of mrs assingham in an omnibus oh i say said the prince while mrs assingham looked at her blandly yes love and i ll give you the penny she shall get there the good lady added to their friend but charlotte as the latter took leave of her thought of something else there s a great favour prince that i want to ask of you i want between this and saturday to make maggie a marriage present oh i say the young man again soothingly exclaimed ah but i must she went on it s really almost for that i came back it was impossible to get in america what i wanted mrs assingham showed anxiety what is it then dear you want but the girl looked only at their companion that s what the prince if he ll be so good must help me to decide can t i mrs assingham asked help you to decide certainly darling we must talk it well over and she kept her eyes on the prince but i want him if he kindly will to go with me to look i want him to judge with me and choose that if you can spare the hour she said is the great favour i mean he raised his eyebrows at her he wonderfully smiled what you came back from america to ask ah certainly then i must find the hour he wonderfully smiled but it was rather more after all than he had been reckoning with it went somehow so little with the rest that directly for him it wasn t the note of safety it preserved this character at the best but by being the note of publicity quickly quickly however the note of publicity struck him as better than any other in another moment even it seemed positively what he wanted for what so much as publicity put their relation on the right footing by this appeal to mrs assingham it was established as right and she immediately showed that such was her own understanding certainly prince she laughed you must find the hour and it was really so express a license from her as representing friendly judgment public opinion the moral law the margin allowed a husband about to be or whatever that after observing to charlotte that should she come to portland place in the morn ing he would make a point of being there to see her and so easily arrange with her about a time he took his departure with the absolutely confirmed impression of knowing as he put it to himself where he was which was what he had prolonged his visit for he was where he could stay iv i don t quite see my dear colonel assingham said to his wife the night of charlotte s arrival i don t quite see i m bound to say why you take it even at the worst so ferociously hard it isn t your fault after all is it i ll be hanged at any rate if it s mine the hour was late and the young lady who had disembarked at southampton that morning to come up by the steamer special and who had then settled herself at an hotel only to re settle herself a couple of hours later at a private house was by this time they might hope peacefully resting from her exploits there had been two men at dinner rather battered brothers in arms of his own period casually picked up by her host the day before and when the gentlemen after the meal rejoined the ladies in the drawing room charlotte pleading fatigue had already excused herself the beguiled warriors however had stayed till after eleven mrs assingham though finally quite without illusions as she said about the military character was always beguiling to old soldiers and as the colonel had come in before dinner only in time to dress he had not till this moment really been summoned to meet his companion over the situation that as he was now to learn their visitor s advent had created for them it was actually more than midnight the servants had been sent to bed the rattle of the wheels had ceased to come in through a window still open to the august air and robert assingham had been steadily learning all the while what it thus behoved him to know but the words just quoted from him presented themselves for the moment as the essence of his spirit and his attitude he disengaged he would be damned if he didn t they were both phrases he repeatedly used his responsibility the simplest the sanest the most obliging of men he habitually indulged in extravagant language his wife had once told him in relation to his violence of speech that such excesses on his part made her think of a retired general whom she had once seen playing with toy soldiers fighting and winning battles carrying on sieges and annihilating enemies with little fortresses of wood and little armies of tin her husband s exaggerated emphasis was his box of toy soldiers his military game it harmlessly gratified in him for his declining years the military instinct bad words when sufficiently numerous and arrayed in their might could represent battalions squadrons tremendous cannonades and glorious charges of cavalry it was natural it was delightful the romance and for her as well of camp life and of the perpetual booming of guns it was fighting to the end to the death but no one was ever killed less fortunate than she nevertheless in spite of his wealth of expression he had not yet found the image that described her favourite game all he could do was practically to leave it to her emulating her own philosophy he had again and again sat up late to discuss those situations in which her finer consciousness abounded but he had never failed to deny that anything in life anything of hers could be a situation for himself she might be in fifty at once if she liked and it was what women did like at their ease after all there always being when they had too much of any some man as they were well aware to get them out he wouldn t at any price have one of any sort whatever of his own or even be in one along with her he watched her accordingly in her favourite element very much as he had sometimes watched at the aquarium the celebrated lady who in a slight though tight bathing suit turned somersaults and did tricks in the tank of water which looked so cold and uncomfortable to the non amphibious he listened to his companion to night while he smoked his last pipe he watched her through her demonstration quite as if he had paid a shilling but it was true that this being the case he desired the value of his money what was it in the name of wonder that she was so bent on being responsible for what did she pretend was going to happen and what at the worst could the poor girl do even granting she wanted to do anything what at the worst for that matter could she be conceived to have in her head if she had told me the moment she got here mrs assingham replied i shouldn t have my difficulty in finding out but she wasn t so obliging and i see no sign at all of her becoming so what s certain is that she didn t come for nothing she wants she worked it out at her leisure to see the prince again that isn t what troubles me i mean that such a fact as a fact isn t but what i ask myself is what does she want it for what s the good of asking yourself if you know you don t know the colonel sat back at his own ease with an ankle resting on the other knee and his eyes attentive to the good appearance of an extremely slender foot which he kept jerking in its neat integument of fine spun black silk and patent leather it seemed to confess this member to consciousness of military discipline everything about it being as polished and perfect as straight and tight and trim as a soldier on parade it went so far as to imply that someone or other would have got something or other confinement to barracks or suppression of pay if it hadn t been just as it was bob assingham was distinguished altogether by a leanness of person a leanness quite distinct from physical laxity which might have been determined on the part of superior powers by views of transport and accommodation and which in fact verged on the abnormal he did himself as well as his friends mostly knew yet remained hungrily thin with facial with abdominal cavities quite grim in their effect and with a consequent looseness of apparel that combined with a choice of queer light shades and of strange straw like textures of the aspect of chinese mats provocative of wonder at his sources of supply suggested the habit of tropic islands a continual cane bottomed chair a governorship exercised on wide verandahs his smooth round head with the particular shade of its white hair was like a silver pot reversed his cheekbones and the bristle of his moustache were worthy of attila the hun the hollows of his eyes were deep and darksome but the eyes within them were like little blue flowers plucked that morning he knew everything that could be known about life which he regarded as for far the greater part a matter of pecuniary arrangement his wife accused him of a want alike of moral and of intellectual reaction or rather indeed of a complete incapacity for either he never went even so far as to understand what she meant and it didn t at all matter since he could be in spite of the limitation a perfectly social creature the infirmities the predicaments of men neither surprised nor shocked him and indeed which was perhaps his only real loss in a thrifty career scarce even amused he took them for granted without horror classifying them after their kind and calculating results and chances he might in old bewildering climates in old campaigns of cruelty and license have had such revelations and known such amazements that he had nothing more to learn but he was wholly content in spite of his fondness in domestic discussion for the superlative degree and his kindness in the oddest way seemed to have nothing to do with his experience he could deal with things perfectly for all his needs without getting near them this was the way he dealt with his wife a large proportion of whose meanings he knew he could neglect he edited for their general economy the play of her mind just as he edited savingly with the stump of a pencil her redundant telegrams the thing in the world that was least of a mystery to him was his club which he was accepted as perhaps too completely managing and which he managed on lines of perfect penetration his connection with it was really a master piece of editing this was in fact to come back very much the process he might have been proposing to apply to mrs assingham s view of what was now before them that is to their connection with charlotte stant s possibilities they wouldn t lavish on them all their little fortune of curiosity and alarm certainly they wouldn t spend their cherished savings so early in the day he liked charlotte moreover who was a smooth and compact inmate and whom he felt as with her instincts that made against waste much more of his own sort than his wife he could talk with her about fanny almost better than he could talk with fanny about charlotte however he made at present the best of the latter necessity even to the pressing of the question he has been noted as having last uttered if you can t think what to be afraid of wait till you can think then you ll do it much better or otherwise if that s waiting too long find out from her don t try to find out from me ask her herself mrs assingham denied as we know that her husband had a play of mind so that she could on her side treat these remarks only as if they had been senseless physical gestures or nervous facial movements she overlooked them as from habit and kindness yet there was no one to whom she talked so persistently of such intimate things it s her friendship with maggie that s the immense complication because that she audibly mused is so natural then why can t she have come out for it she came out mrs assingham continued to meditate because she hates america there was no place for her there she didn t fit in she wasn t in sympathy no more were the people she saw then it s hideously dear she can t on her means begin to live there not at all as she can in a way here in the way you mean of living with us of living with anyone she can t live by visits alone and she doesn t want to she s too good for it even if she could but she will she must sooner or later stay with them maggie will want her maggie will make her besides she ll want to herself then why won t that do the colonel asked for you to think it s what she has come for how will it do how she went on as without hearing him that s what one keeps feeling why shouldn t it do beautifully that anything of the past she brooded should come back now how will it do how will it do it will do i daresay without your wringing your hands over it when my dear the colonel pursued as he smoked have you ever seen anything of yours anything that you ve done not do ah i didn t do this it brought her answer straight i didn t bring her back did you expect her to stay over there all her days to oblige you not a bit for i shouldn t have minded her coming after their marriage it s her coming this way before to which she added with inconsequence i m too sorry for her of course she can t enjoy it but i don t see what perversity rides her she needn t have looked it all so in the face as she doesn t do it i suppose simply for discipline it s almost that s the bore of it discipline to me perhaps then said bob assingham that s what has been her idea take it for god s sake as discipline to you and have done with it it will do he added for discipline to me as well she was far however from having done with it it was a situation with such different sides as she said and to none of which one could in justice be blind it isn t in the least you know for instance that i believe she s bad never never mrs assingham declared i don t think that of her then why isn t that enough nothing was enough mrs assingham signified but that she should develop her thought she doesn t deliberately intend she doesn t consciously wish the least complication it s perfectly true that she thinks maggie a dear as who doesn t she s incapable of any plan to hurt a hair of her head yet here she is and there they are she wound up her husband again for a little smoked in silence what in the world between them ever took place between charlotte and the prince why nothing except their having to recognise that nothing could that was their little romance it was even their little tragedy but what the deuce did they do do they fell in love with each other but seeing it wasn t possible gave each other up then where was the romance why in their frustration in their having the courage to look the facts in the face what facts the colonel went on well to begin with that of their neither of them having the means to marry if she had had even a little a little i mean for two i believe he would bravely have done it after which as her husband but emitted an odd vague sound she corrected herself i mean if he himself had had only a little or a little more than a little a little for a prince they would have done what they could she did them justice if there had been a way but there wasn t a way and charlotte quite to her honour i consider understood it he had to have money it was a question of life and death it wouldn t have been a bit amusing either to marry him as a pauper i mean leaving him one that was what she had as he had the reason to see and their reason is what you call their romance she looked at him a moment what do you want more didn t he the colonel inquired want anything more or didn t for that matter poor charlotte herself she kept her eyes on him there was a manner in it that half answered they were thoroughly in love she might have been his she checked herself she even for a minute lost herself she might have been anything she liked except his wife but she wasn t said the colonel very smokingly she wasn t mrs assingham echoed the echo not loud but deep filled for a little the room he seemed to listen to it die away then he began again how are you sure she waited before saying but when she spoke it was definite there wasn t time he had a small laugh for her reason he might have expected some other does it take so much time she herself however remained serious it takes more than they had he was detached but he wondered what was the matter with their time after which as remembering it all living it over and piecing it together she only considered you mean that you came in with your idea he demanded it brought her quickly to the point and as if also in a measure to answer herself not a bit of it then but you surely recall she went on the way a year ago everything took place they had parted before he had ever heard of maggie why hadn t he heard of her from charlotte herself because she had never spoken of her is that also the colonel inquired what she has told you i m not speaking his wife returned of what she has told me that s one thing i m speaking of what i know by myself that s another you feel in other words that she lies to you bob assingham more sociably asked she neglected the question treating it as gross she never so much at the time as named maggie it was so positive that it appeared to strike him it s he then who has told you she after a moment admitted it it s he and he doesn t lie no to do him justice i believe he absolutely doesn t if i hadn t believed it mrs assingham declared for her general justification i would have had nothing to do with him that is in this connection he s a gentleman i mean all as much of one as he ought to be and he had nothing to gain that helps she added even a gentleman it was i who named maggie to him a year from last may he had never heard of her before then it s grave said the colonel she hesitated do you mean grave for me oh that everything s grave for you is what we take for granted and are fundamentally talking about it s grave it was for charlotte and it s grave for maggie that is it was when he did see her or when she did see him you don t torment me as much as you would like she presently went on because you think of nothing that i haven t a thousand times thought of and because i think of everything that you never will it would all she recognised have been grave if it hadn t all been right you can t make out she contended that we got to rome before the end of february he more than agreed there s nothing in life my dear that i can make out well there was nothing in life apparently that she at real need couldn t charlotte who had been there that year from early quite from november left suddenly you ll quite remember about the th of april she was to have stayed on she was to have stayed naturally more or less for us and she was to have stayed all the more that the ververs due all winter but delayed week after week in paris were at last really coming they were coming that is maggie was largely to see her and above all to be with her there it was all altered by charlotte s going to florence she went from one day to the other you forget everything she gave her reasons but i thought it odd at the time i had a sense that something must have happened the difficulty was that though i knew a little i didn t know enough i didn t know her relation with him had been as you say a near thing that is i didn t know how near the poor girl s departure was a flight she went to save herself he had listened more than he showed as came out in his tone to save herself well also really i think to save him too i saw it afterwards i see it all now he would have been sorry he didn t want to hurt her oh i daresay the colonel laughed they generally don t at all events his wife pursued she escaped they both did for they had had simply to face it their marriage couldn t be and if that was so the sooner they put the apennines between them the better it had taken them it is true some time to feel this and to find it out they had met constantly and not always publicly all that winter they had met more than was known though it was a good deal known more certainly she said than i then imagined though i don t know what difference it would after all have made with me i liked him i thought him charming from the first of our knowing him and now after more than a year he has done nothing to spoil it and there are things he might have done things that many men easily would therefore i believe in him and i was right at first in knowing i was going to so i haven t and she stated it as she might have quoted from a slate after adding up the items the sum of a column of figures so i haven t i say to myself been a fool well are you trying to make out that i ve said you have all their case wants at any rate bob assingham declared is that you should leave it well alone it s theirs now they ve bought it over the counter and paid for it it has ceased to be yours of which case she asked are you speaking he smoked a minute then with a groan lord are there so many there s maggie s and the prince s and there s the prince s and charlotte s oh yes and then the colonel scoffed there s charlotte s and the prince s there s maggie s and charlotte s she went on and there s also maggie s and mine i think too that there s charlotte s and mine yes she mused charlotte s and mine is certainly a case in short you see there are plenty but i mean she said to keep my head are we to settle them all he inquired to night i should lose it if things had happened otherwise if i had acted with any folly she had gone on in her earnestness unheeding of his question i shouldn t be able to bear that now but my good conscience is my strength no one can accuse me the ververs came on to rome alone charlotte after their days with her in florence had decided about america maggie i daresay had helped her she must have made her a present and a handsome one so that many things were easy charlotte left them came to england joined somebody or other sailed for new york i have still her letter from milan telling me i didn t know at the moment all that was behind it but i felt in it nevertheless the undertaking of a new life certainly in any case it cleared that air i mean the dear old roman in which we were steeped it left the field free it gave me a free hand there was no question for me of anybody else when i brought the two others together more than that there was no question for them so you see she concluded where that puts me she got up on the words very much as if they were the blue daylight towards which through a darksome tunnel she had been pushing her way and the elation in her voice combined with her recovered alertness might have signified the sharp whistle of the train that shoots at last into the open she turned about the room she looked out a moment into the august night she stopped here and there before the flowers in bowls and vases yes it was distinctly as if she had proved what was needing proof as if the issue of her operation had been almost unexpectedly a success old arithmetic had perhaps been fallacious but the new settled the question her husband oddly however kept his place without apparently measuring these results as he had been amused at her intensity so he was not uplifted by her relief his interest might in fact have been more enlisted than he allowed do you mean he presently asked that he had already forgot about charlotte she faced round as if he had touched a spring he wanted to naturally and it was much the best thing he could do she was in possession of the main case as it truly seemed she had it all now he was capable of the effort and he took the best way remember too what maggie then seemed to us she s very nice but she always seems to me more than anything else the young woman who has a million a year if you mean that that s what she especially seemed to him you of course place the thing in your light the effort to forget charlotte couldn t i grant you have been so difficult this pulled her up but for an instant i never said he didn t from the first i never said that he doesn t more and more like maggie s money i never said i shouldn t have liked it myself bob assingham returned he made no movement he smoked another minute how much did maggie know how much she seemed to consider as if it were between quarts and gallons how best to express the quantity she knew what charlotte in florence had told her and what had charlotte told her very little what makes you so sure why this that she couldn t tell her and she explained a little what she meant there are things my dear haven t you felt it yourself coarse as you are that no one could tell maggie there are things that upon my word i shouldn t care to attempt to tell her now the colonel smoked on it she d be so scandalised she d be so frightened she d be in her strange little way so hurt she wasn t born to know evil she must never know it bob assingham had a queer grim laugh the sound of which in fact fixed his wife before him we re taking grand ways to prevent it but she stood there to protest we re not taking any ways the ways are all taken they were taken from the moment he came up to our carriage that day in villa borghese the second or third of her days in rome when as you remember you went off somewhere with mr verver and the prince who had got into the carriage with us came home with us to tea they had met they had seen each other well they were in relation the rest was to come of itself and as it could it began practically i recollect in our drive maggie happened to learn by some other man s greeting of him in the bright roman way from a streetcorner as we passed that one of the prince s baptismal names the one always used for him among his relations was amerigo which as you probably don t know however even after a lifetime of me was the name four hundred years ago or whenever of the pushing man who followed across the sea in the wake of columbus and succeeded where columbus had failed in becoming godfather or name father to the new continent so that the thought of any connection with him can even now thrill our artless breasts the colonel s grim placidity could always quite adequately meet his wife s not infrequent imputation of ignorances on the score of the land of her birth unperturbed and unashamed and these dark depths were even at the present moment not directly lighted by an inquiry that managed to be curious without being apologetic but where does the connection come in his wife was prompt by the women that is by some obliging woman of old who was a descendant of the pushing man the make believe discoverer and whom the prince is therefore luckily able to refer to as an ancestress a branch of the other family had become great great enough at least to marry into his and the name of the navigator crowned with glory was very naturally to become so the fashion among them that some son of every generation was appointed to wear it my point is at any rate that i recall noticing at the time how the prince was from the start helped with the dear ververs by his wearing it the connection became romantic for maggie the moment she took it in she filled out in a flash every link that might be vague by that sign i quite said to myself he ll conquer with his good fortune of course of having the other necessary signs too it really said mrs assingham was practically the fine side of the wedge which struck me as also she wound up a lovely note for the candour of the ververs the colonel took in the tale but his comment was prosaic he knew amerigo what he was about and i don t mean the old one i know what you mean his wife bravely threw off the old one he pointed his effect isn t the only discoverer in the family oh as much as you like if he discovered america or got himself honoured as if he had his successors were in due time to discover the americans and it was one of them in particular doubtless who was to discover how patriotic we are wouldn t this be the same one the colonel asked who really discovered what you call the connection she gave him a look the connection s a true thing the connection s perfectly historic your insinuations recoil upon your cynical mind don t you understand she asked that the history of such people is known root and branch at every moment of its course oh it s all right said bob assingham go to the british museum his companion continued with spirit and what am i to do there there s a whole immense room or recess or department or whatever filled with books written about his family alone you can see for yourself have you seen for your self she faltered but an instant certainly i went one day with maggie we looked him up so to say they were most civil and she fell again into the current her husband had slightly ruffled the effect was produced the charm began to work at all events in rome from that hour of the prince s drive with us my only course afterwards had to be to make the best of it it was certainly good enough for that mrs assingham hastened to add and i didn t in the least see my duty in making the worst in the same situation to day i wouldn t act differently i entered into the case as it then appeared to me and as for the matter of that it still does i liked it i thought all sorts of good of it and nothing can even now she said with some intensity make me think anything else nothing can ever make you think anything you don t want to the colonel still in his chair remarked over his pipe you ve got a precious power of thinking whatever you do want you want also from moment to moment to think such desperately different things what happened he went on was that you fell violently in love with the prince yourself and that as you couldn t get me out of the way you had to take some roundabout course you couldn t marry him any more than charlotte could that is not to yourself but you could to somebody else it was always the prince it was always marriage you could to your little friend to whom there were no objections not only there were no objections but there were reasons positive ones and all excellent all charming she spoke with an absence of all repudiation of his exposure of the spring of her conduct and this abstention clearly and effectively conscious evidently cost her nothing it is always the prince and it is always thank heaven marriage and these are the things god grant that it will always be that i could help a year ago most assuredly made me happy and it continues to make me happy then why aren t you quiet i am quiet said fanny assingham he looked at her with his colourless candour still in his place she moved about again a little emphasising by her unrest her declaration of her tranquillity he was as silent at first as if he had taken her answer but he was not to keep it long what do you make of it that by your own show charlotte couldn t tell her all what do you make of it that the prince didn t tell her anything say one understands that there are things she can t be told since as you put it she is so easily scared and shocked he produced these objections slowly giving her time by his pauses to stop roaming and come back to him but she was roaming still when he concluded his inquiry if there hadn t been anything there shouldn t have been between the pair before charlotte bolted in order precisely as you say that there shouldn t be why in the world was what there had been too bad to be spoken of mrs assingham after this question continued still to circulate not directly meeting it even when at last she stopped i thought you wanted me to be quiet so i do and i m trying to make you so much so that you won t worry more can t you be quiet on that she thought a moment then seemed to try to relate that she had to bolt for the reasons we speak of even though the bolting had done for her what she wished that i can perfectly feel charlotte s not wanting to do ah then if it has done for her what she wished but the colonel s conclusion hung by the if which his wife didn t take up so it hung but the longer when he presently spoke again all one wonders in that case is why then she has come back to him say she hasn t come back to him not really to him i ll say anything you like but that won t do me the same good as your saying it nothing my dear will do you good mrs assingham returned you don t care for anything in itself you care for nothing but to be grossly amused because i don t keep washing my hands i thought your whole argument was that everything is so right that this is precisely what you do but his wife as it was a point she had often made could go on as she had gone on before you re perfectly indifferent really you re perfectly immoral you ve taken part in the sack of cities and i m sure you ve done dreadful things yourself but i don t trouble my head if you like so now there she laughed he accepted her laugh but he kept his way well i back poor charlotte back her to know what she wants ah then so do i she does know what she wants and mrs assingham produced this quantity at last on the girl s behalf as the ripe result of her late wanderings and musings she had groped through their talk for the thread and now she had got it she wants to be magnificent she is said the colonel almost cynically she wants his wife now had it fast to be thoroughly superior and she s capable of that of wanting to of carrying out her idea and what is her idea to see maggie through bob assingham wondered through what through everything she knows the prince and maggie doesn t no dear thing mrs assingham had to recognise it she doesn t so that charlotte has come out to give her lessons she continued fanny assingham to work out her thought she has done this great thing for him that is a year ago she practically did it she practically at any rate helped him to do it himself and helped me to help him she kept off she stayed away she left him free and what moreover were her silences to maggie but a direct aid to him if she had spoken in florence if she had told her own poor story if she had come back at any time till within a few weeks ago if she hadn t gone to new york and hadn t held out there if she hadn t done these things all that has happened since would certainly have been different therefore she s in a position to be consistent now she knows the prince mrs assingham repeated it involved even again her former recognition and maggie dear thing doesn t she was high she was lucid she was almost inspired and it was but the deeper drop therefore to her husband s flat common sense in other words maggie is by her ignorance in danger then if she s in danger there is danger there won t be with charlotte s understanding of it that s where she has had her conception of being able to be heroic of being able in fact to be sublime she is she will be the good lady by this time glowed so she sees it to become for her best friend an element of positive safety bob assingham looked at it hard which of them do you call her best friend she gave a toss of impatience i ll leave you to discover but the grand truth thus made out she had now completely adopted it s for us therefore to be hers hers you and i it s for us to be charlotte s it s for us on our side to see her through through her sublimity through her noble lonely life only that s essential it mustn t be lonely it will be all right if she marries so we re to marry her we re to marry her it will be mrs assingham continued the great thing i can do she made it out more and more it will make up make up for what as she said nothing however his desire for lucidity renewed itself if everything s so all right what is there to make up for why if i did do either of them by any chance a wrong if i made a mistake you ll make up for it by making another and then as she again took her time i thought your whole point is just that you re sure one can never be ideally sure of anything there are always possibilities then if we can but strike so wild why keep meddling it made her again look at him where would you have been my dear if i hadn t meddled with you ah that wasn t meddling i was your own i was your own said the colonel from the moment i didn t object well these people won t object they are my own too in the sense that i m awfully fond of them also in the sense she continued that i think they re not so very much less fond of me our relation all round exists it s a reality and a very good one we re mixed up so to speak and it s too late to change it we must live in it and with it therefore to see that charlotte gets a good husband as soon as possible that as i say will be one of my ways of living it will cover she said with conviction all the ground and then as his own conviction appeared to continue as little to match the ground i mean of any nervousness i may ever feel it will be in fact my duty and i shan t rest till my duty s performed she had arrived by this time at something like exaltation i shall give for the next year or two if necessary my life to it i shall have done in that case what i can he took it at last as it came you hold there s no limit to what you can i don t say there s no limit or anything of the sort i say there are good chances enough of them for hope why shouldn t there be when a girl is after all all that she is by after all you mean after she s in love with somebody else the colonel put his question with a quietude doubtless designed to be fatal but it scarcely pulled her up she s not too much in love not herself to want to marry she would now particularly like to has she told you so not yet it s too soon but she will meanwhile however i don t require the information her marrying will prove the truth and what truth the truth of everything i say prove it to whom well to myself to begin with that will be enough for me to work for her what it will prove mrs assingham presently went on will be that she s cured that she accepts the situation he paid this the tribute of a long pull at his pipe the situation of doing the one thing she can that will really seem to cover her tracks his wife looked at him the good dry man as if now at last he was merely vulgar the one thing she can do that will really make new tracks altogether the thing that before any other will be wise and right the thing that will best give her her chance to be magnificent he slowly emitted his smoke and best give you by the same token yours to be magnificent with her i shall be as magnificent at least as i can bob assingham got up and you call me immoral she hesitated i ll call you stupid if you prefer but stupidity pushed to a certain point is you know immorality just so what is morality but high intelligence this he was unable to tell her which left her more definitely to conclude besides it s all at the worst great fun oh if you simply put it at that his implication was that in this case they had a common ground yet even thus he couldn t catch her by it oh i don t mean she said from the threshold the fun that you mean good night in answer to which as he turned out the electric light he gave an odd short groan almost a grunt he had apparently meant some particular kind v well now i must tell you for i want to be absolutely honest so charlotte spoke a little ominously after they had got into the park i don t want to pretend and i can t pretend a moment longer you may think of me what you will but i don t care i knew i shouldn t and i find now how little i came back for this not really for anything else for this she repeated as under the influence of her tone the prince had already come to a pause for this he spoke as if the particular thing she indicated were vague to him or were rather a quantity that couldn t at the most be much it would be as much however as she should be able to make it to have one hour alone with you it had rained heavily in the night and though the pavements were now dry thanks to a cleansing breeze the august morning with its hovering thick drifting clouds and freshened air was cool and grey the multitudinous green of the park had been deepened and a wholesome smell of irrigation purging the place of dust and of odours less acceptable rose from the earth charlotte had looked about her with expression from the first of their coming in quite as if for a deep greeting for general recognition the day was even in the heart of london of a rich low browed weatherwashed english type it was as if it had been waiting for her as if she knew it placed it loved it as if it were in fact a part of what she had come back for so far as this was the case the impression of course could only be lost on a mere vague italian it was one of those for which you had to be blessedly an american as indeed you had to be blessedly an american for all sorts of things so long as you hadn t blessedly or not to remain in america the prince had by half past ten as also by definite appointment called in cadogan place for mrs assingham s visitor and then after brief delay the two had walked together up sloane street and got straight into the park from knightsbridge the understanding to this end had taken its place after a couple of days as inevitably consequent on the appeal made by the girl during those first moments in mrs assingham s drawing room it was an appeal the couple of days had done nothing to invalidate everything much rather to place in a light and as to which obviously it wouldn t have fitted that anyone should raise an objection who was there for that matter to raise one from the moment mrs assingham informed and apparently not disapproving didn t intervene this the young man had asked himself with a very sufficient sense of what would have made him ridiculous he wasn t going to begin that at least was certain by showing a fear even had fear at first been sharp in him moreover it would already not a little have dropped so happy all round so propitious he quite might have called it had been the effect of this rapid interval the time had been taken up largely by his active reception of his own wedding guests and by maggie s scarce less absorbed entertainment of her friend whom she had kept for hours together in portland place whom she had not as wouldn t have been convenient invited altogether as yet to migrate but who had been present with other persons his contingent at luncheon at tea at dinner at perpetual repasts he had never in his life it struck him had to reckon with so much eating whenever he had looked in if he had not again till this hour save for a minute seen charlotte alone so positively all the while he had not seen even maggie and if therefore he had not seen even maggie nothing was more natural than that he shouldn t have seen charlotte the exceptional minute a mere snatch at the tail of the others on the huge portland place staircase had sufficiently enabled the girl to remind him so ready she assumed him to be of what they were to do time pressed if they were to do it at all everyone had brought gifts his relations had brought wonders how did they still have where did they still find such treasures she only had brought nothing and she was ashamed yet even by the sight of the rest of the tribute she wouldn t be put off she would do what she could and he was unknown to maggie he must remember to give her his aid he had prolonged the minute so far as to take time to hesitate for a reason and then to risk bringing his reason out the risk was because he might hurt her hurt her pride if she had that particular sort but she might as well be hurt one way as another and besides that particular sort of pride was just what she hadn t so his slight resistance while they lingered had been just easy enough not to be impossible i hate to encourage you and for such a purpose after all to spend your money she had stood a stair or two below him where while she looked up at him beneath the high domed light of the hall she rubbed with her palm the polished mahogany of the balustrade which was mounted on fine ironwork eighteenth century english because you think i must have so little i ve enough at any rate enough for us to take our hour enough she had smiled is as good as a feast and then she had said it isn t of course a question of anything expensive gorged with treasure as maggie is it isn t a question of competing or outshining what naturally in the way of the priceless hasn t she got mine is to be the offering of the poor something precisely that no rich person could ever give her and that being herself too rich ever to buy it she would therefore never have charlotte had spoken as if after so much thought only as it can t be fine it ought to be funny and that s the sort of thing to hunt for hunting in london besides is amusing in itself he recalled even how he had been struck with her word funny oh i don t mean a comic toy i mean some little thing with a charm but absolutely right in its comparative cheapness that s what i call funny she had explained you used she had also added to help me to get things cheap in rome you were splendid for beating down i have them all still i needn t say the little bargains i there owed you there are bargains in london in august ah but i don t understand your english buying and i confess i find it dull so much as that while they turned to go up together he had objected i understood my poor dear romans it was they who understood you that was your pull she had laughed our amusement here is just that they don t understand us we can make it amusing you ll see if he had hesitated again it was because the point permitted the amusement surely will be to find our present certainly as i say well if they don t come down then we ll come up there s always something to be done besides prince she had gone on i m not if you come to that absolutely a pauper i m too poor for some things she had said yet strange as she was lightly enough but i m not too poor for others and she had paused again at the top i ve been saving up he had really challenged it in america yes even there with my motive and we oughtn t you know she had wound up to leave it beyond to morrow that definitely with ten words more was what had passed he feeling all the while how any sort of begging off would only magnify it he might get on with things as they were but he must do anything rather than magnify besides which it was pitiful to make her beg of him he was making her she had begged and this for a special sensibility in him didn t at all do that was accordingly in fine how they had come to where they were he was engaged as hard as possible in the policy of not magnifying he had kept this up even on her making a point and as if it were almost the whole point that maggie of course was not to have an idea half the interest of the thing at least would be that she shouldn t suspect therefore he was completely to keep it from her as charlotte on her side would that they had been anywhere at all together or had so much as seen each other for five minutes alone the absolute secrecy of their little excursion was in short of the essence she appealed to his kindness to let her feel that he didn t betray her there had been something frankly a little disconcerting in such an appeal at such an hour on the very eve of his nuptials it was one thing to have met the girl casually at mrs assingham s and another to arrange with her thus for a morning practically as private as their old mornings in rome and practically not less intimate he had immediately told maggie the same evening of the minutes that had passed between them in cadogan place though not mentioning those of mrs assingham s absence any more than he mentioned the fact of what their friend had then with such small delay proposed but what had briefly checked his assent to any present to any positive making of mystery what had made him while they stood at the top of the stairs demur just long enough for her to notice it was the sense of the resemblance of the little plan before him to occasions of the past from which he was quite disconnected from which he could only desire to be this was like beginning something over which was the last thing he wanted the strength the beauty of his actual position was in its being wholly a fresh start was that what it began would be new altogether these items of his consciousness had clustered so quickly that by the time charlotte read them in his face he was in presence of what they amounted to she had challenged them as soon as read them had met them with a do you want then to go and tell her that had somehow made them ridiculous it had made him promptly fall back on minimizing it that is on minimizing fuss apparent scruples were obviously fuss and he had on the spot clutched in the light of this truth at the happy principle that would meet every case this principle was simply to be with the girl always simple and with the very last simplicity that would cover everything it had covered then and there certainly his immediate submission to the sight of what was clearest this was really that what she asked was little compared to what she gave what she gave touched him as she faced him for it was the full tune of her renouncing she really renounced renounced everything and without even insisting now on what it had all been for her her only insistence was her insistence on the small matter of their keeping their appointment to themselves that in exchange for everything everything she gave up was verily but a trifle he let himself accordingly be guided he so soon assented for enlightened indulgence to any particular turn she might wish the occasion to take that the stamp of her preference had been well applied to it even while they were still in the park the application in fact presently required that they should sit down a little really to see where they were in obedience to which propriety they had some ten minutes of a quality quite distinct in a couple of penny chairs under one of the larger trees they had taken for their walk to the cropped rain freshened grass after finding it already dry and the chairs turned away from the broad alley the main drive and the aspect of park lane looked across the wide reaches of green which seemed in a manner to refine upon their freedom they helped charlotte thus to make her position her temporary position still more clear and it was for this purpose obviously that abruptly on seeing her opportunity she sat down he stood for a little before her as if to mark the importance of not wasting time the importance she herself had previously insisted on but after she had said a few words it was impossible for him not to resort again to good nature he marked as he could by this concession that if he had finally met her first proposal for what would be amusing in it so any idea she might have would contribute to that effect he had consequently in all consistency to treat it as amusing that she reaffirmed and reaffirmed again the truth that was her truth i don t care what you make of it and i don t ask anything whatever of you anything but this i want to have said it that s all i want not to have failed to say it to see you once and be with you to be as we are now and as we used to be for one small hour or say for two that s what i have had for weeks in my head i mean of course to get it before before what you re going to do so all the while you see she went on with her eyes on him it was a question for me if i should be able to manage it in time if i couldn t have come now i probably shouldn t have come at all perhaps even ever now that i m here i shall stay but there were moments over there when i despaired it wasn t easy there were reasons but it was either this or nothing so i didn t struggle you see in vain after oh i didn t want that i don t mean she smiled that it wouldn t have been delightful to see you even then to see you at any time but i would never have come for it this is different this is what i wanted this is what i ve got this is what i shall always have this is what i should have missed of course she pursued if you had chosen to make me miss it if you had thought me horrid had refused to come i should naturally have been immensely sold i had to take the risk well you re all i could have hoped that s what i was to have said i didn t want simply to get my time with you but i wanted you to know i wanted you she kept it up slowly softly with a small tremor of voice but without the least failure of sense or sequence i wanted you to understand i wanted you that is to hear i don t care i think whether you understand or not if i ask nothing of you i don t i mayn t ask even so much as that what you may think of me that doesn t in the least matter what i want is that it shall always be with you so that you ll never be able quite to get rid of it that i did i won t say that you did you may make as little of that as you like but that i was here with you where we are and as we are i just saying this giving myself in other words away and perfectly willing to do it for nothing that s all she paused as if her demonstration was complete yet for the moment without moving as if in fact to give it a few minutes to sink in into the listening air into the watching space into the conscious hospitality of nature so far as nature was all londonised all vulgarised with them there or even for that matter into her own open ears rather than into the attention of her passive and prudent friend his attention had done all that attention could do his handsome slightly anxious yet still more definitely amused face sufficiently played its part he clutched however at what he could best clutch at the fact that she let him off definitely let him off she let him off it seemed even from so much as answering so that while he smiled back at her in return for her information he felt his lips remain closed to the successive vaguenesses of rejoinder of objection that rose for him from within charlotte herself spoke again at last you may want to know what i get by it but that s my own affair he really didn t want to know even this or continued for the safest plan quite to behave as if he didn t which prolonged the mere dumbness of diversion in which he had taken refuge he was glad when finally the point she had wished to make seeming established to her satisfaction they brought to what might pass for a close the moment of his life at which he had had least to say movement and progress after this with more impersonal talk were naturally a relief so that he was not again during their excursion at a loss for the right word the air had been as it were cleared they had their errand itself to discuss and the opportunities of london the sense of the wonderful place the pleasures of prowling there the question of shops of possibilities of particular objects noticed by each in previous prowls each professed surprise at the extent of the other s knowledge the prince in especial wondered at his friend s possession of her london he had rather prized his own possession the guidance he could really often give a cabman it was a whim of his own a part of his anglomania and congruous with that feature which had after all so much more surface than depth when his companion with the memory of other visits and other rambles spoke of places he hadn t seen and things he didn t know he actually felt again as half the effect just a shade humiliated he might even have felt a trifle annoyed if it hadn t been on this spot for his being even more interested it was a fresh light on charlotte and on her curious world quality of which in rome he had had his due sense but which clearly would show larger on the big london stage rome was in comparison a village a family party a little old world spinnet for the fingers of one hand by the time they reached the marble arch it was almost as if she were showing him a new side and that in fact gave amusement a new and a firmer basis the right tone would be easy for putting himself in her hands should they disagree a little frankly and fairly about directions and chances values and authenticities the situation would be quite gloriously saved they were none the less as happened much of one mind on the article of their keeping clear of resorts with which maggie would be acquainted charlotte recalled it as a matter of course named it in time as a condition they would keep away from any place to which he had already been with maggie this made indeed a scant difference for though he had during the last month done few things so much as attend his future wife on her making of purchases the antiquarii as he called them with charlotte had not been the great affair except in bond street really maggie had had no use for them her situation indeed in connection with that order of traffic was full of consequences produced by her father s mr verver one of the great collectors of the world hadn t left his daughter to prowl for herself he had little to do with shops and was mostly as a purchaser approached privately and from afar great people all over europe sought introductions to him high personages incredibly high and more of them than would ever be known solemnly sworn as everyone was in such cases to discretion high personages made up to him as the one man on the short authentic list likely to give the price it had therefore been easy to settle as they walked that the tracks of the ververs daughter s as well as father s were to be avoided the importance only was that their talk about it led for a moment to the first words they had as yet exchanged on the subject of maggie charlotte still in the park proceeded to them for it was she who began with a serenity of appreciation that was odd certainly as a sequel to her words of ten minutes before this was another note on her what he would have called another light for her companion who though without giving a sign admired for what it was the simplicity of her transition a transition that took no trouble either to trace or to explain itself she paused again an instant on the grass to make it she stopped before him with a sudden anything of course dear as she is will do for her i mean if i were to give her a pin cushion from the baker street bazaar that s exactly what i meant the prince laughed out this allusion to their snatch of talk in portland place it s just what i suggested she took however no notice of the reminder she went on in her own way but it isn t a reason in that case one would never do anything for her i mean charlotte explained if one took advantage of her character of her character we mustn t take advantage of her character the girl again unheeding pursued one mustn t if not for her at least for one s self she saves one such trouble she had spoken thoughtfully with her eyes on her friend s she might have been talking preoccupied and practical of someone with whom he was comparatively unconnected she certainly gives one no trouble said the prince and then as if this were perhaps ambiguous or inadequate she s not selfish god forgive her enough that s what i mean charlotte instantly said she s not selfish enough there s nothing absolutely that one need do for her she s so modest she developed she doesn t miss things i mean if you love her or rather i should say if she loves you she lets it go the prince frowned a little as a tribute after all to seriousness she lets what anything anything that you might do and that you don t she lets everything go but her own disposition to be kind to you it s of herself that she asks efforts so far as she ever has to ask them she hasn t much she does everything herself and that s terrible the prince had listened but always with propriety he didn t commit himself terrible well unless one is almost as good as she it makes too easy terms for one it takes stuff within one so far as one s decency is concerned to stand it and nobody charlotte continued in the same manner is decent enough good enough to stand it not without help from religion or something of that kind not without prayer and fasting that is without taking great care certainly she said such people as you and i are not the prince obligingly thought an instant not good enough to stand it well not good enough not rather to feel the strain we happen each i think to be of the kind that are easily spoiled her friend again for propriety followed the argument oh i don t know may not one s affection for her do something more for one s decency as you call it than her own generosity her own affection her decency has the unfortunate virtue to undo ah of course it must be all in that but she had made her question all the same interesting to him what it comes to one can see what you mean is the way she believes in one that is if she believes at all yes that s what it comes to said charlotte stant and why he asked almost soothingly should it be terrible he couldn t at the worst see that because it s always so the idea of having to pity people not when there s also with it the idea of helping them yes but if we can t help them we can we always can that is he competently added if we care for them and that s what we re talking about yes she on the whole assented it comes back then to our absolutely refusing to be spoiled certainly but everything the prince laughed as they went on all your decency i mean comes back to that she walked beside him a moment it s just what i meant she then reasonably said vi the man in the little shop in which well after this they lingered longest the small but interesting dealer in the bloomsbury street who was remarkable for an insistence not importunate inasmuch as it was mainly mute but singularly intensely coercive this personage fixed on his visitors an extraordinary pair of eyes and looked from one to the other while they considered the object with which he appeared mainly to hope to tempt them they had come to him last for their time was nearly up an hour of it at least from the moment of their getting into a hansom at the marble arch having yielded no better result than the amusement invoked from the first the amusement of course was to have consisted in seeking but it had also involved the idea of finding which latter necessity would have been obtrusive only if they had found too soon the question at present was if they were finding and they put it to each other in the bloomsbury shop while they enjoyed the undiverted attention of the shopman he was clearly the master and devoted to his business the essence of which in his conception might precisely have been this particular secret that he possessed for worrying the customer so little that it fairly made for their relations a sort of solemnity he had not many things none of the redundancy of rot they had elsewhere seen and our friends had on entering even had the sense of a muster so scant that as high values obviously wouldn t reign the effect might be almost pitiful then their impression had changed for though the show was of small pieces several taken from the little window and others extracted from a cupboard behind the counter dusky in the rather low browed place despite its glass doors each bid for their attention spoke however modestly for itself and the pitch of their entertainer s pretensions was promptly enough given his array was heterogeneous and not at all imposing still it differed agreeably from what they had hitherto seen charlotte after the incident was to be full of impressions of several of which later on she gave her companion always in the interest of their amusement the benefit and one of the impressions had been that the man himself was the greatest curiosity they had looked at the prince was to reply to this that he himself hadn t looked at him as precisely in the general connection charlotte had more than once from other days noted for his advantage her consciousness of how below a certain social plane he never saw one kind of shopman was just like another to him which was oddly inconsequent on the part of a mind that where it did notice noticed so much he took throughout always the meaner sort for granted the night of their meanness or whatever name one might give it for him made all his cats grey he didn t no doubt want to hurt them but he imaged them no more than if his eyes acted only for the level of his own high head her own vision acted for every relation this he had seen for himself she remarked beggars she remembered servants she recognised cabmen she had often distinguished beauty when out with him in dirty children she had admired type in faces at hucksters stalls therefore on this occasion she had found their antiquario interesting partly because he cared so for his things and partly because he cared well so for them he likes his things he loves them she was to say and it isn t only it isn t perhaps even at all that he loves to sell them i think he would love to keep them if he could and he prefers at any rate to sell them to right people we clearly were right people he knows them when he sees them and that s why as i say you could make out or at least i could that he cared for us didn t you see she was to ask it with an insistence the way he looked at us and took us in i doubt if either of us have ever been so well looked at before yes he ll remember us she was to profess herself convinced of that almost to uneasiness but it was after all this was perhaps reassuring because given his taste since he has taste he was pleased with us he was struck he had ideas about us well i should think people might we re beautiful aren t we and he knows then also he has his way for that way of saying nothing with his lips when he s all the while pressing you so with his face which shows how he knows you feel it that is a regular way of decent old gold old silver old bronze of old chased and jewelled artistry were the objects that successively produced had ended by numerously dotting the counter where the shopman s slim light fingers with neat nails touched them at moments briefly nervously tenderly as those of a chess player rest a few seconds over the board on a figure he thinks he may move and then may not small florid ancientries ornaments pendants lockets brooches buckles pretexts for dim brilliants bloodless rubies pearls either too large or too opaque for value miniatures mounted with diamonds that had ceased to dazzle snuffboxes presented to or by the too questionable great cups trays taper stands suggestive of pawn tickets archaic and brown that would themselves if preserved have been prized curiosities a few commemorative medals of neat outline but dull reference a classic monument or two things of the first years of the century things consular napoleonic temples obelisks arches tinily re embodied completed the discreet cluster in which however even after tentative reinforcement from several quaint rings intaglios amethysts carbuncles each of which had found a home in the ancient sallow satin of some weakly snapping little box there was in spite of the due proportion of faint poetry no great force of persuasion they looked the visitors they touched they vaguely pretended to consider but with scepticism so far as courtesy permitted in the quality of their attention it was impossible they shouldn t after a little tacitly agree as to the absurdity of carrying to maggie a token from such a stock it would be that was the difficulty pretentious without being good too usual as a treasure to have been an inspiration of the giver and yet too primitive to be taken as tribute welcome on any terms they had been out more than two hours and evidently had found nothing it forced from charlotte a kind of admission it ought really if it should be a thing of this sort to take its little value from having belonged to one s self ecco said the prince just triumphantly enough there you are behind the dealer were sundry small cupboards in the wall two or three of these charlotte had seen him open so that her eyes found themselves resting on those he had not visited but she completed her admission there s nothing here she could wear it was only after a moment that her companion rejoined is there anything do you think that you could it made her just start she didn t at all events look at the objects she but looked for an instant very directly at him no ah the prince quietly exclaimed would it be charlotte asked your idea to offer me something well why not as a small ricordo but a ricordo of what why of this as you yourself say of this little hunt oh i say it but hasn t my whole point been that i don t ask you to therefore she demanded but smiling at him now where s the logic oh the logic he laughed but logic s everything that at least is how i feel it a ricordo from you from you to me is a ricordo of nothing it has no reference ah my dear he vaguely protested their entertainer meanwhile stood there with his eyes on them and the girl though at this minute more interested in her passage with her friend than in anything else again met his gaze it was a comfort to her that their foreign tongue covered what they said and they might have appeared of course as the prince now had one of the snuffboxes in his hand to be discussing a purchase you don t refer she went on to her companion i refer he had lifted the lid of his little box and he looked into it hard do you mean by that then that you would be free free to offer me something this gave her a longer pause and when she spoke again she might have seemed oddly to be addressing the dealer would you allow me no said the prince into his little box you wouldn t accept it from me no he repeated in the same way she exhaled a long breath that was like a guarded sigh but you ve touched an idea that has been mine it s what i ve wanted then she added it was what i hoped he put down his box this had drawn his eyes he made nothing clearly of the little man s attention it s what you brought me out for well that s at any rate she returned my own affair but it won t do it won t do cara mia it s impossible it s impossible and he took up one of the brooches she had another pause while the shopman only waited if i were to accept from you one of these charming little ornaments as you suggest what should i do with it he was perhaps at last a little irritated he even as if he might understand looked vaguely across at their host wear it per bacco where then please under my clothes wherever you like but it isn t then if you will he added worth talking about it s only worth talking about mio caro she smiled from your having begun it my question is only reasonable so that your idea may stand or fall by your answer to it if i should pin one of these things on for you would it be to your mind that i might go home and show it to maggie as your present they had had between them often in talk the refrain jocosely descriptively applied of old roman it had been as a pleasantry in the other time his explanation to her of everything but nothing truly had even seemed so old roman as the shrug in which he now indulged why in the world not because on our basis it would be impossible to give her an account of the pretext the pretext he wondered the occasion this ramble that we shall have had together and that we re not to speak of oh yes he said after a moment i remember we re not to speak of it that of course you re pledged to and the one thing you see goes with the other so you don t insist he had again at random laid back his trinket with which he quite turned to her a little wearily at last even a little impatiently i don t insist it disposed for the time of the question but what was next apparent was that it had seen them no further the shopman who had not stirred stood there in his patience which his mute intensity helping had almost the effect of an ironic comment the prince moved to the glass door and his back to the others as with nothing more to contribute looked though not less patiently into the street then the shopman for charlotte momentously broke silence you ve seen disgraziatamente signora principessa he sadly said too much and it made the prince face about for the effect of the momentous came if not from the sense from the sound of his words which was that of the suddenest sharpest italian charlotte exchanged with her friend a glance that matched it and just for the minute they were held in check but their glance had after all by that time said more than one thing had both exclaimed on the apprehension by the wretch of their intimate conversation let alone of her possible her impossible title and remarked for mutual reassurance that it didn t all the same matter the prince remained by the door but immediately addressing the speaker from where he stood you re italian then are you but the reply came in english oh dear no you re english to which the answer was this time with a smile in briefest italian che the dealer waived the question he practically disposed of it by turning straightway toward a receptacle to which he had not yet resorted and from which after unlocking it he extracted a square box of some twenty inches in height covered with worn looking leather he placed the box on the counter pushed back a pair of small hooks lifted the lid and removed from its nest a drinking vessel larger than a common cup yet not of exorbitant size and formed to appearance either of old fine gold or of some material once richly gilt he handled it with tenderness with ceremony making a place for it on a small satin mat my golden bowl he observed and it sounded on his lips as if it said everything he left the important object for as important it did somehow present itself to produce its certain effect simple but singularly elegant it stood on a circular foot a short pedestal with a slightly spreading base and though not of signal depth justified its title by the charm of its shape as well as by the tone of its surface it might have been a large goblet diminished to the enhancement of its happy curve by half its original height as formed of solid gold it was impressive it seemed indeed to warn off the prudent admirer charlotte with care immediately took it up while the prince who had after a minute shifted his position again regarded it from a distance it was heavier than charlotte had thought gold really gold she asked of their companion he hesitated look a little and perhaps you ll make out she looked holding it up in both her fine hands turning it to the light it may be cheap for what it is but it will be dear i m afraid for me well said the man i can part with it for less than its value i got it you see for less for how much then again he waited always with his serene stare do you like it then charlotte turned to her friend do you like it he came no nearer he looked at their companion cos e well signori miei if you must know it s just a perfect crystal of course we must know per dio said the prince but he turned away again he went back to his glass door charlotte set down the bowl she was evidently taken do you mean it s cut out of a single crystal if it isn t i think i can promise you that you ll never find any joint or any piecing she wondered even if i were to scrape off the gold he showed though with due respect that she amused him you couldn t scrape it off it has been too well put on put on i don t know when and i don t know how but by some very fine old worker and by some beautiful old process charlotte frankly charmed with the cup smiled back at him now a lost art call it a lost art but of what time then is the whole thing well say also of a lost time the girl considered then if it s so precious how comes it to be cheap her interlocutor once more hung fire but by this time the prince had lost patience i ll wait for you out in the air he said to his companion and though he spoke without irritation he pointed his remark by passing immediately into the street where during the next minutes the others saw him his back to the shopwindow philosophically enough hover and light a fresh cigarette charlotte even took a little her time she was aware of his funny italian taste for london street life her host meanwhile at any rate answered her question ah i ve had it a long time without selling it i think i must have been keeping it madam for you you ve kept it for me because you ve thought i mightn t see what s the matter with it he only continued to face her he only continued to appear to follow the play of her mind what is the matter with it oh it s not for me to say it s for you honestly to tell me of course i know something must be but if it s something you can t find out isn t it as good as if it were nothing i probably should find out as soon as i had paid for it not her host lucidly insisted if you hadn t paid too much what do you call she asked little enough well what should you say to fifteen pounds i should say said charlotte with the utmost promptitude that it s altogether too much the dealer shook his head slowly and sadly but firmly it s my price madam and if you admire the thing i think it really might be yours it s not too much it s too little it s almost nothing i can t go lower charlotte wondering but resisting bent over the bowl again then it s impossible it s more than i can afford ah the man returned one can sometimes afford for a present more than one can afford for one s self he said it so coaxingly that she found herself going on without as might be said putting him in his place oh of course it would be only for a present then it would be a lovely one does one make a present she asked of an object that contains to one s knowledge a flaw well if one knows of it one has only to mention it the good faith the man smiled is always there and leave the person to whom one gives the thing you mean to discover it he wouldn t discover it if you re speaking of a gentleman i m not speaking of anyone in particular charlotte said well whoever it might be he might know and he might try but he wouldn t find she kept her eyes on him as if though unsatisfied mystified she yet had a fancy for the bowl not even if the thing should come to pieces and then as he was silent not even if he should have to say to me the golden bowl is broken he was still silent after which he had his strangest smile ah if anyone should want to smash it she laughed she almost admired the little man s expression you mean one could smash it with a hammer yes if nothing else would do or perhaps even by dashing it with violence say upon a marble floor oh marble floors but she might have been thinking for they were a connection marble floors a connection with many things with her old rome and with his with the palaces of his past and a little of hers with the possibilities of his future with the sumptuosities of his marriage with the wealth of the ververs all the same however there were other things and they all together held for a moment her fancy does crystal then break when it is crystal i thought its beauty was its hardness her friend in his way discriminated its beauty is its being crystal but its hardness is certainly its safety it doesn t break he went on like vile glass it splits if there is a split ah charlotte breathed with interest if there is a split and she looked down again at the bowl there is a split eh crystal does split eh on lines and by laws of its own you mean if there s a weak place for all answer after an hesitation he took the bowl up again holding it aloft and tapping it with a key it rang with the finest sweetest sound where is the weak place she then did the question justice well for me only the price i m poor you see very poor but i thank you and i ll think the prince on the other side of the shop window had finally faced about and as to see if she hadn t done was trying to reach with his eyes the comparatively dim interior i like it she said i want it but i must decide what i can do the man not ungraciously resigned himself well i ll keep it for you the small quarter of an hour had had its marked oddity this she felt even by the time the open air and the bloomsbury aspects had again in their protest against the truth of her gathered impression made her more or less their own yet the oddity might have been registered as small as compared to the other effect that before they had gone much further she had with her companion to take account of this latter was simply the effect of their having by some tacit logic some queer inevitability quite dropped the idea of a continued pursuit they didn t say so but it was on the line of giving up maggie s present that they practically proceeded the line of giving it up without more reference to it the prince s first reference was in fact quite independently made i hope you satisfied yourself before you had done of what was the matter with that bowl no indeed i satisfied myself of nothing of nothing at least but that the more i looked at it the more i liked it and that if you weren t so unaccommodating this would be just the occasion for your giving me the pleasure of accepting it he looked graver for her at this than he had looked all the morning do you propose it seriously without wishing to play me a trick she wondered what trick would it be he looked at her harder you mean you really don t know but know what why what s the matter with it you didn t see all the while she only continued however to stare how could you see out in the street i saw before i went out it was because i saw that i did go out i didn t want to have another scene with you before that rascal and i judged you would presently guess for yourself is he a rascal charlotte asked his price is so moderate she waited but a moment five pounds really so little five pounds he continued to look at her five pounds he might have been doubting her word but he was only it appeared gathering emphasis it would be dear to make a gift of at five shillings if it had cost you even but five pence i wouldn t take it from you then she asked what is the matter why it has a crack it sounded on his lips so sharp it had such an authority that she almost started while her colour at the word rose it was as if he had been right though his assurance was wonderful you answer for it without having looked i did look i saw the object itself it told its story no wonder it s cheap but it s exquisite charlotte as if with an interest in it now made even tenderer and stranger found herself moved to insist of course it s exquisite that s the danger then a light visibly came to her a light in which her friend suddenly and intensely showed the reflection of it as she smiled at him was in her own face the danger i see is because you re superstitious per dio i m superstitious a crack is a crack and an omen s an omen you d be afraid per bacco for your happiness for my happiness for your safety for my safety she just paused for your marriage for my marriage for everything she thought again thank goodness then that if there be a crack we know it but if we may perish by cracks in things that we don t know and she smiled with the sadness of it we can never then give each other anything he considered but he met it ah but one does know i do at least and by instinct i don t fail that will always protect me it was funny the way he said such things yet she liked him really the more for it they fell in for her with a general or rather with a special vision but she spoke with a mild despair what then will protect me where i m concerned i will from me at least you ve nothing to fear he now quite amiably responded anything you consent to accept from me but he paused well well shall be perfect that s very fine she presently answered it s vain after all for you to talk of my accepting things when you ll accept nothing from me ah there better still he could meet her you attach an impossible condition that i mean of my keeping your gift so to myself well she looked before him there at the condition then abruptly with a gesture she gave it up she had a headshake of disenchantment so far as the idea had appealed to her it all appeared too difficult oh my condition i don t hold to it you may cry it on the housetops anything i ever do ah well then this made he laughed all the difference but it was too late oh i don t care now i should have liked the bowl but if that won t do there s nothing he considered this he took it in looking graver again but after a moment he qualified yet i shall want some day to give you something she wondered at him what day the day you marry for you will marry you must seriously marry she took it from him but it determined in her the only words she was to have uttered all the morning that came out as if a spring had been pressed to make you feel better well he replied frankly wonderfully it will but here he added is your hansom he had signalled the cab was charging she put out no hand for their separation but she prepared to get in before she did so however she said what had been gathering while she waited well i would marry i think to have something from you in all freedom part second vii adam verver at fawns that autumn sunday might have been observed to open the door of the billiard room with a certain freedom might have been observed that is had there been a spectator in the field the justification of the push he had applied however and of the push equally sharp that to shut himself in he again applied the ground of this energy was precisely that he might here however briefly find himself alone alone with the handful of letters newspapers and other unopened missives to which during and since breakfast he had lacked opportunity to give an eye the vast square clean apartment was empty and its large clear windows looked out into spaces of terrace and garden of park and woodland and shining artificial lake of richly condensed horizon all dark blue upland and church towered village and strong cloudshadow which were together a thing to create the sense with everyone else at church of one s having the world to one s self we share this world none the less for the hour with mr verver the very fact of his striking as he would have said for solitude the fact of his quiet flight almost on tiptoe through tortuous corridors investing him with an interest that makes our attention tender indeed almost to compassion qualify his achieved isolation for it may immediately be mentioned that this amiable man bethought himself of his personal advantage in general only when it might appear to him that other advantages those of other persons had successfully put in their claim it may be mentioned also that he always figured other persons such was the law of his nature as a numerous array and that though conscious of but a single near tie one affection one duty deepest rooted in his life it had never for many minutes together been his portion not to feel himself surrounded and committed never quite been his refreshment to make out where the many coloured human appeal represented by gradations of tint diminishing concentric zones of intensity of importunity really faded to the blessed impersonal whiteness for which his vision sometimes ached it shaded off the appeal he would have admitted that but he had as yet noted no point at which it positively stopped thus had grown in him a little habit his innermost secret not confided even to maggie though he felt she understood it as she understood to his view everything thus had shaped itself the innocent trick of occasionally making believe that he had no conscience or at least that blankness in the field of duty did reign for an hour a small game to which the few persons near enough to have caught him playing it and of whom mrs assingham for instance was one attached indulgently that idea of quaintness quite in fact that charm of the pathetic involved in the preservation by an adult of one of childhood s toys when he took a rare moment off he did so with the touching confessing eyes of a man of forty seven caught in the act of handling a relic of infancy sticking on the head of a broken soldier or trying the lock of a wooden gun it was essentially in him the imitation of depravity which for amusement as might have been he practised keeping up in spite of practice he was still imperfect for these so artlessly artful interludes were condemned by the nature of the case to brevity he had fatally stamped himself it was his own fault a man who could be interrupted with impunity the greatest of wonders moreover was exactly in this that so interrupted a man should ever have got as the phrase was should above all have got so early to where he was it argued a special genius he was clearly a case of that the spark of fire the point of light sat somewhere in his inward vagueness as a lamp before a shrine twinkles in the dark perspective of a church and while youth and early middle age while the stiff american breeze of example and opportunity were blowing upon it hard had made of the chamber of his brain a strange workshop of fortune this establishment mysterious and almost anonymous the windows of which at hours of highest pressure never seemed for starers and wonderers perceptibly to glow must in fact have been during certain years the scene of an unprecedented a miraculous white heat the receipt for producing which it was practically felt that the master of the forge could not have communicated even with the best intentions the essential pulse of the flame the very action of the cerebral temperature brought to the highest point yet extraordinarily contained these facts themselves were the immensity of the result they were one with perfection of machinery they had constituted the kind of acquisitive power engendered and applied the necessary triumph of all operations a dim explanation of phenomena once vivid must at all events for the moment suffice us it being obviously no account of the matter to throw on our friend s amiability alone the weight of the demonstration of his economic history amiability of a truth is an aid to success it has even been known to be the principle of large accumulations but the link for the mind is none the less fatally missing between proof on such a scale of continuity if of nothing more insolent in one field and accessibility to distraction in every other variety of imagination what is that but fatal in the world of affairs unless so disciplined as not to be distinguished from monotony mr verver then for a fresh full period a period betraying extraordinarily no wasted year had been inscrutably monotonous behind an iridescent cloud the cloud was his native envelope the soft looseness so to say of his temper and tone not directly expressive enough no doubt to figure an amplitude of folds but of a quality unmistakable for sensitive feelers he was still reduced in fine to getting his rare moments with himself by feigning a cynicism his real inability to maintain the pretence however had perhaps not often been better instanced than by his acceptance of the inevitable to day his acceptance of it on the arrival at the end of a quarter of an hour of that element of obligation with which he had all the while known he must reckon a quarter of an hour of egoism was about as much as he taking one situation with another usually got mrs rance opened the door more tentatively indeed than he himself had just done but on the other hand as if to make up for this she pushed forward even more briskly on seeing him than he had been moved to do on seeing nobody then with force it came home to him that he had definitely a week before established a precedent he did her at least that justice it was a kind of justice he was always doing someone he had on the previous sunday liked to stop at home and he had exposed himself thereby to be caught in the act to make this possible that is mrs rance had only had to like to do the same the trick was so easily played it had not occurred to him to plan in any way for her absence which would have destroyed somehow in principle the propriety of his own presence if persons under his roof hadn t a right not to go to church what became for a fair mind of his own right his subtlest manoeuvre had been simply to change from the library to the billiard room it being in the library that his guest or his daughter s or the guest of the miss lutches he scarce knew in which light to regard her had then and not unnaturally of course joined him it was urged on him by his memory of the duration of the visit she had that time as it were paid him that the law of recurrence would already have got itself enacted she had spent the whole morning with him was still there in the library when the others came back thanks to her having been tepid about their taking mr verver and she a turn outside it had been as if she looked on that as a kind of subterfuge almost as a form of disloyalty yet what was it she had in mind what did she wish to make of him beyond what she had already made a patient punctilious host mindful that she had originally arrived much as a stranger arrived not at all deliberately or yearningly invited so that one positively had her possible susceptibilities the more on one s conscience the miss lutches the sisters from the middle west were there as friends of maggie s friends of the earlier time but mrs rance was there or at least had primarily appeared only as a friend of the miss lutches this lady herself was not of the middle west she rather insisted on it but of new jersey rhode island or delaware one of the smallest and most intimate states he couldn t remember which though she insisted too on that it was not in him we may say it for him to go so far as to wonder if their group were next to be recruited by some friend of her own and this partly because she had struck him verily rather as wanting to get the miss lutches themselves away than to extend the actual circle and partly as well as more essentially because such connection as he enjoyed with the ironic question in general resided substantially less in a personal use of it than in the habit of seeing it as easy to others he was so framed by nature as to be able to keep his inconveniences separate from his resentments though indeed if the sum of these latter had at the most always been small that was doubtless in some degree a consequence of the fewness of the former his greatest inconvenience he would have admitted had he analyzed was in finding it so taken for granted that as he had money he had force it pressed upon him hard and all round assuredly this attribution of power everyone had need of one s power whereas one s own need at the best would have seemed to be but some trick for not communicating it the effect of a reserve so merely so meanly defensive would in most cases beyond question sufficiently discredit the cause wherefore though it was complicating to be perpetually treated as an infinite agent the outrage was not the greatest of which a brave man might complain complaint besides was a luxury and he dreaded the imputation of greed the other the constant imputation that of being able to do would have no ground if he hadn t been to start with this was the point provably luxurious his lips somehow were closed and by a spring connected moreover with the action of his eyes themselves the latter showed him what he had done showed him where he had come out quite at the top of his hill of difficulty the tall sharp spiral round which he had begun to wind his ascent at the age of twenty and the apex of which was a platform looking down if one would on the kingdoms of the earth and with standing room for but half a dozen others his eyes in any case now saw mrs rance approach with an instant failure to attach to the fact any grossness of avidity of mrs rance s own or at least to descry any triumphant use even for the luridest impression of her intensity what was virtually supreme would be her vision of his having attempted by his desertion of the library to mislead her which in point of fact barely escaped being what he had designed it was not easy for him in spite of accumulations fondly and funnily regarded as of systematic practice not now to be ashamed the one thing comparatively easy would be to gloss over his course the billiard room was not at the particular crisis either a natural or a graceful place for the nominally main occupant of so large a house to retire to and this without prejudice either to the fact that his visitor wouldn t as he apprehended explicitly make him a scene should she frankly denounce him for a sneak he would simply go to pieces but he was after an instant not afraid of that wouldn t she rather as emphasising their communion accept and in a manner exploit the anomaly treat it perhaps as romantic or possibly even as comic show at least that they needn t mind even though the vast table draped in brown holland thrust itself between them as an expanse of desert sand she couldn t cross the desert but she could and did beautifully get round it so that for him to convert it into an obstacle he would have had to cause himself as in some childish game or unbecoming romp to be pursued to be genially hunted this last was a turn he was well aware the occasion should on no account take and there loomed before him for the mere moment the prospect of her fairly proposing that they should knock about the balls that danger certainly it struck him he should manage in some way to deal with why too for that matter had he need of defences material or other how was it a question of dangers really to be called such the deep danger the only one that made him as an idea positively turn cold would have been the possibility of her seeking him in marriage of her bringing up between them that terrible issue here fortunately she was powerless it being apparently so provable against her that she had a husband in undiminished existence she had him it was true only in america only in texas in nebraska in arizona or somewhere somewhere that at old fawns house in the county of kent scarcely counted as a definite place at all it showed somehow from afar as so lost so indistinct and illusory in the great alkali desert of cheap divorce she had him even in bondage poor man had him in contempt had him in remembrance so imperfect as barely to assert itself but she had him none the less in existence unimpeached the miss lutches had seen him in the flesh as they had appeared eager to mention though when they were separately questioned their descriptions failed to tally he would be at the worst should it come to the worst mrs rance s difficulty and he served therefore quite enough as the stout bulwark of anyone else this was in truth logic without a flaw yet it gave mr verver less comfort than it ought he feared not only danger he feared the idea of danger or in other words feared hauntedly himself it was above all as a symbol that mrs rance actually rose before him a symbol of the supreme effort that he should have sooner or later as he felt to make this effort would be to say no he lived in terror of having to he should be proposed to at a given moment it was only a question of time and then he should have to do a thing that would be extremely disagreeable he almost wished on occasion that he wasn t so sure he would do it he knew himself however well enough not to doubt he knew coldly quite bleakly where he would at the crisis draw the line it was maggie s marriage and maggie s finer happiness happy as he had supposed her before that had made the difference he hadn t in the other time it now seemed to him had to think of such things they hadn t come up for him and it was as if she positively had herself kept them down she had only been his child which she was indeed as much as ever but there were sides on which she had protected him as if she were more than a daughter she had done for him more than he knew much and blissfully as he always had known if she did at present more than ever through having what she called the change in his life to make up to him for his situation still all the same kept pace with her activity his situation being simply that there was more than ever to be done there had not yet been quite so much on all the showing as since their return from their twenty months in america as since their settlement again in england experimental though it was and the consequent sense now quite established for him of a domestic air that had cleared and lightened producing the effect for their common personal life of wider perspectives and large waiting spaces it was as if his son in law s presence even from before his becoming his son in law had somehow filled the scene and blocked the future very richly and handsomely when all was said not at all inconveniently or in ways not to have been desired inasmuch as though the prince his measure now practically taken was still pretty much the same big fact the sky had lifted the horizon receded the very foreground itself expanded quite to match him quite to keep everything in comfortable scale at first certainly their decent little old time union maggie s and his own had resembled a good deal some pleasant public square in the heart of an old city into which a great palladian church say something with a grand architectural front had suddenly been dropped so that the rest of the place the space in front the way round outside to the east end the margin of street and passage the quantity of over arching heaven had been temporarily compromised not even then of a truth in a manner disconcerting given that is for the critical or at least the intelligent eye the great style of the facade and its high place in its class the phenomenon that had since occurred whether originally to have been pronounced calculable or not had not naturally been the miracle of a night but had taken place so gradually quietly easily that from this vantage of wide wooded fawns with its eighty rooms as they said with its spreading park with its acres and acres of garden and its majesty of artificial lake though that for a person so familiar with the great ones might be rather ridiculous no visibility of transition showed no violence of adjustment in retrospect emerged the palladian church was always there but the piazza took care of itself the sun stared down in his fulness the air circulated and the public not less the limit stood off the way round was easy the east end was as fine in its fashion as the west and there were also side doors for entrance between the two large monumental ornamental in their style as for all proper great churches by some such process in fine had the prince for his father in law while remaining solidly a feature ceased to be at all ominously a block mr verver it may further be mentioned had taken at no moment sufficient alarm to have kept in detail the record of his reassurance but he would none the less not have been unable not really have been indisposed to impart in confidence to the right person his notion of the history of the matter the right person it is equally distinct had not for this illumination been wanting but had been encountered in the form of fanny assingham not for the first time indeed admitted to his counsels and who would have doubtless at present in any case from plenitude of interest and with equal guarantees repeated his secret it all came then the great clearance from the one prime fact that the prince by good fortune hadn t proved angular he clung to that description of his daughter s husband as he often did to terms and phrases in the human the social connection that he had found for himself it was his way to have times of using these constantly as if they just then lighted the world or his own path in it for him even when for some of his interlocutors they covered less ground it was true that with mrs assingham he never felt quite sure of the ground anything covered she disputed with him so little agreed with him so much surrounded him with such systematic consideration such predetermined tenderness that it was almost which he had once told her in irritation as if she were nursing a sick baby he had accused her of not taking him seriously and she had replied as from her it couldn t frighten him that she took him religiously adoringly she had laughed again as she had laughed before on his producing for her that good right word about the happy issue of his connection with the prince with an effect the more odd perhaps as she had not contested its value she couldn t of course however be at the best as much in love with his discovery as he was himself he was so much so that he fairly worked it to his own comfort came in fact sometimes near publicly pointing the moral of what might have occurred if friction so to speak had occurred he pointed it frankly one day to the personage in question mentioned to the prince the particular justice he did him was even explicit as to the danger that in their remarkable relation they had thus escaped oh if he had been angular who could say what might then have happened he spoke and it was the way he had spoken to mrs assingham too as if he grasped the facts without exception for which angularity stood it figured for him clearly as a final idea a conception of the last vividness he might have been signifying by it the sharp corners and hard edges all the stony pointedness the grand right geometry of his spreading palladian church just so he was insensible to no feature of the felicity of a contact that beguilingly almost confoundingly was a contact but with practically yielding lines and curved surfaces you re round my boy he had said you re all you re variously and inexhaustibly round when you might by all the chances have been abominably square i m not sure for that matter he had added that you re not square in the general mass whether abominably or not the abomination isn t a question for you re inveterately round that s what i mean in the detail it s the sort of thing in you that one feels or at least i do with one s hand say you had been formed all over in a lot of little pyramidal lozenges like that wonderful side of the ducal palace in venice so lovely in a building but so damnable for rubbing against in a man and especially in a near relation i can see them all from here each of them sticking out by itself all the architectural cut diamonds that would have scratched one s softer sides one would have been scratched by diamonds doubtless the neatest way if one was to be scratched at all but one would have been more or less reduced to a hash as it is for living with you re a pure and perfect crystal i give you my idea i think you ought to have it just as it has come to me the prince had taken the idea in his way for he was well accustomed by this time to taking and nothing perhaps even could more have confirmed mr verver s account of his surface than the manner in which these golden drops evenly flowed over it they caught in no interstice they gathered in no concavity the uniform smoothness betrayed the dew but by showing for the moment a richer tone the young man in other words unconfusedly smiled though indeed as if assenting from principle and habit to more than he understood he liked all signs that things were well but he cared rather less why they were in regard to the people among whom he had since his marriage been living the reasons they so frequently gave so much oftener than he had ever heard reasons given before remained on the whole the element by which he most differed from them and his father in law and his wife were after all only first among the people among whom he had been living he was never even yet sure of how at this that or the other point he would strike them they felt remarkably so often things he hadn t meant and missed not less remarkably and not less often things he had he had fallen back on his general explanation we haven t the same values by which he understood the same measure of importance his curves apparently were important because they had been unexpected or still more unconceived whereas when one had always as in his relegated old world taken curves and in much greater quantities too for granted one was no more surprised at the resulting feasibility of intercourse than one was surprised at being upstairs in a house that had a staircase he had in fact on this occasion disposed alertly enough of the subject of mr verver s approbation the promptitude of his answer we may in fact well surmise had sprung not a little from a particular kindled remembrance this had given his acknowledgment its easiest turn oh if i m a crystal i m delighted that i m a perfect one for i believe that they sometimes have cracks and flaws in which case they re to be had very cheap he had stopped short of the emphasis it would have given his joke to add that there had been certainly no having him cheap and it was doubtless a mark of the good taste practically reigning between them that mr verver had not on his side either taken up the opportunity it is the latter s relation to such aspects however that now most concerns us and the bearing of his pleased view of this absence of friction upon amerigo s character as a representative precious object representative precious objects great ancient pictures and other works of art fine eminent pieces in gold in silver in enamel majolica ivory bronze had for a number of years so multiplied themselves round him and as a general challenge to acquisition and appreciation so engaged all the faculties of his mind that the instinct the particular sharpened appetite of the collector had fairly served as a basis for his acceptance of the prince s suit over and above the signal fact of the impression made on maggie herself the aspirant to his daughter s hand showed somehow the great marks and signs stood before him with the high authenticities he had learned to look for in pieces of the first order adam verver knew by this time knew thoroughly no man in europe or in america he privately believed was less capable in such estimates of vulgar mistakes he had never spoken of himself as infallible it was not his way but apart from the natural affections he had acquainted himself with no greater joy of the intimately personal type than the joy of his originally coming to feel and all so unexpectedly that he had in him the spirit of the connoisseur he had like many other persons in the course of his reading been struck with keats s sonnet about stout cortez in the presence of the pacific but few persons probably had so devoutly fitted the poet s grand image to a fact of experience it consorted so with mr verver s consciousness of the way in which at a given moment he had stared at his pacific that a couple of perusals of the immortal lines had sufficed to stamp them in his memory his peak in darien was the sudden hour that had transformed his life the hour of his perceiving with a mute inward gasp akin to the low moan of apprehensive passion that a world was left him to conquer and that he might conquer it if he tried it had been a turning of the page of the book of life as if a leaf long inert had moved at a touch and eagerly reversed had made such a stir of the air as sent up into his face the very breath of the golden isles to rifle the golden isles had on the spot become the business of his future and with the sweetness of it what was most wondrous of all still more even in the thought than in the act the thought was that of the affinity of genius or at least of taste with something in himself with the dormant intelligence of which he had thus almost violently become aware and that affected him as changing by a mere revolution of the screw his whole intellectual plane he was equal somehow with the great seers the invokers and encouragers of beauty and he didn t after all perhaps dangle so far below the great producers and creators he had been nothing of that kind before too decidedly too dreadfully not but now he saw why he had been what he had why he had failed and fallen short even in huge success now he read into his career in one single magnificent night the immense meaning it had waited for it was during his first visit to europe after the death of his wife when his daughter was ten years old that the light in his mind had so broken and he had even made out at that time why on an earlier occasion the journey of his honeymoon year it had still been closely covered he had bought then so far as he had been able but he had bought almost wholly for the frail fluttered creature at his side who had had her fancies decidedly but all for the art then wonderful to both of them of the rue de la paix the costly authenticities of dressmakers and jewellers her flutter pale disconcerted ghost as she actually was a broken white flower tied round almost grotesquely for his present sense with a huge satin bow of the boulevard her flutter had been mainly that of ribbons frills and fine fabrics all funny pathetic evidence for memory of the bewilderments overtaking them as a bridal pair confronted with opportunity he could wince fairly still as he remembered the sense in which the poor girl s pressure had under his fond encouragement indeed been exerted in favour of purchase and curiosity these were wandering images out of the earlier dusk that threw her back for his pity into a past more remote than he liked their common past their young affection to appear it would have had to be admitted to an insistent criticism that maggie s mother all too strangely had not so much failed of faith as of the right application of it since she had exercised it eagerly and restlessly made it a pretext for innocent perversities in respect to which philosophic time was at last to reduce all groans to gentleness and they had loved each other so that his own intelligence on the higher line had temporarily paid for it the futilities the enormities the depravities of decoration and ingenuity that before his sense was unsealed she had made him think lovely musing reconsidering little man that he was and addicted to silent pleasures as he was accessible to silent pains he even sometimes wondered what would have become of his intelligence in the sphere in which it was to learn more and more exclusively to play if his wife s influence upon it had not been in the strange scheme of things so promptly removed would she have led him altogether attached as he was to her into the wilderness of mere mistakes would she have prevented him from ever scaling his vertiginous peak or would she otherwise have been able to accompany him to that eminence where he might have pointed out to her as cortez to his companions the revelation vouchsafed no companion of cortez had presumably been a real lady mr verver allowed that historic fact to determine his inference viii what was at all events not permanently hidden from him was a truth much less invidious about his years of darkness it was the strange scheme of things again the years of darkness had been needed to render possible the years of light a wiser hand than he at first knew had kept him hard at acquisition of one sort as a perfect preliminary to acquisition of another and the preliminary would have been weak and wanting if the good faith of it had been less his comparative blindness had made the good faith which in its turn had made the soil propitious for the flower of the supreme idea he had had to like forging and sweating he had had to like polishing and piling up his arms they were things at least he had had to believe he liked just as he had believed he liked transcendent calculation and imaginative gambling all for themselves the creation of interests that were the extinction of other interests the livid vulgarity even of getting in or getting out first that had of course been so far from really the case with the supreme idea all the while growing and striking deep under everything in the warm rich earth he had stood unknowing he had walked and worked where it was buried and the fact itself the fact of his fortune would have been a barren fact enough if the first sharp tender shoot had never struggled into day there on one side was the ugliness his middle time had been spared there on the other from all the portents was the beauty with which his age might still be crowned he was happier doubtless than he deserved but that when one was happy at all it was easy to be he had wrought by devious ways but he had reached the place and what would ever have been straighter in any man s life than his way now of occupying it it hadn t merely his plan all the sanctions of civilization it was positively civilization condensed concrete consummate set down by his hands as a house on a rock a house from whose open doors and windows open to grateful to thirsty millions the higher the highest knowledge would shine out to bless the land in this house designed as a gift primarily to the people of his adoptive city and native state the urgency of whose release from the bondage of ugliness he was in a position to measure in this museum of museums a palace of art which was to show for compact as a greek temple was compact a receptacle of treasures sifted to positive sanctity his spirit to day almost altogether lived making up as he would have said for lost time and haunting the portico in anticipation of the final rites these would be the opening exercises the august dedication of the place his imagination he was well aware got over the ground faster than his judgment there was much still to do for the production of his first effect foundations were laid and walls were rising the structure of the shell all determined but raw haste was forbidden him in a connection so intimate with the highest effects of patience and piety he should belie himself by completing without a touch at least of the majesty of delay a monument to the religion he wished to propagate the exemplary passion the passion for perfection at any price he was far from knowing as yet where he would end but he was admirably definite as to where he wouldn t begin he wouldn t begin with a small show he would begin with a great and he could scarce have indicated even had he wished to try the line of division he had drawn he had taken no trouble to indicate it to his fellow citizens purveyors and consumers in his own and the circumjacent commonwealths of comic matter in large lettering diurnally set up printed published folded and delivered at the expense of his presumptuous emulation of the snail the snail had become for him under this ironic suggestion the loveliest beast in nature and his return to england of which we are present witnesses had not been unconnected with the appreciation so determined it marked what he liked to mark that he needed on the matter in question instruction from no one on earth a couple of years of europe again of renewed nearness to changes and chances refreshed sensibility to the currents of the market would fall in with the consistency of wisdom the particular shade of enlightened conviction that he wished to observe it didn t look like much for a whole family to hang about waiting they being now since the birth of his grandson a whole family and there was henceforth only one ground in all the world he felt on which the question of appearance would ever really again count for him he cared that a work of art of price should look like the master to whom it might perhaps be deceitfully attributed but he had ceased on the whole to know any matter of the rest of life by its looks he took life in general higher up the stream so far as he was not actually taking it as a collector he was taking it decidedly as a grandfather in the way of precious small pieces he had handled nothing so precious as the principino his daughter s first born whose italian designation endlessly amused him and whom he could manipulate and dandle already almost toss and catch again as he couldn t a correspondingly rare morsel of an earlier pate tendre he could take the small clutching child from his nurse s arms with an iteration grimly discountenanced in respect to their contents by the glass doors of high cabinets something clearly beatific in this new relation had moreover without doubt confirmed for him the sense that none of his silent answers to public detraction to local vulgarity had ever been so legitimately straight as the mere element of attitude reduce it he said to that in his easy weeks at fawns the element of attitude was all he wanted of these weeks and he was enjoying it on the spot even more than he had hoped enjoying it in spite of mrs rance and the miss lutches in spite of the small worry of his belief that fanny assingham had really something for him that she was keeping back in spite of his full consciousness overflowing the cup like a wine too generously poured that if he had consented to marry his daughter and thereby to make as it were the difference what surrounded him now was exactly consent vivified marriage demonstrated the difference in fine definitely made he could call back his prior his own wedded consciousness it was not yet out of range of vague reflection he had supposed himself above all he had supposed his wife as married as anyone could be and yet he wondered if their state had deserved the name or their union worn the beauty in the degree to which the couple now before him carried the matter in especial since the birth of their boy in new york the grand climax of their recent american period brought to so right an issue the happy pair struck him as having carried it higher deeper further to where it ceased to concern his imagination at any rate to follow them extraordinary beyond question was one branch of his characteristic mute wonderment it characterised above all with its subject before it his modesty the strange dim doubt waking up for him at the end of the years of whether maggie s mother had after all been capable of the maximum the maximum of tenderness he meant as the terms existed for him the maximum of immersion in the fact of being married maggie herself was capable maggie herself at this season was exquisitely divinely the maximum such was the impression that positively holding off a little for the practical the tactful consideration it inspired in him a respect for the beauty and sanctity of it almost amounting to awe such was the impression he daily received from her she was her mother oh yes but her mother and something more it becoming thus a new light for him and in such a curious way too that anything more than her mother should prove at this time of day possible he could live over again at almost any quiet moment the long process of his introduction to his present interests an introduction that had depended all on himself like the cheek of the young man who approaches a boss without credentials or picks up an acquaintance makes even a real friend by speaking to a passer in the street his real friend in all the business was to have been his own mind with which nobody had put him in relation he had knocked at the door of that essentially private house and his call in truth had not been immediately answered so that when after waiting and coming back he had at last got in it was twirling his hat as an embarrassed stranger or trying his keys as a thief at night he had gained confidence only with time but when he had taken real possession of the place it had been never again to come away all of which success represented it must be allowed his one principle of pride pride in the mere original spring pride in his money would have been pride in something that had come in comparison so easily the right ground for elation was difficulty mastered and his difficulty thanks to his modesty had been to believe in his facility this was the problem he had worked out to its solution the solution that was now doing more than all else to make his feet settle and his days flush and when he wished to feel good as they said at american city he had but to retrace his immense development that was what the whole thing came back to that the development had not been somebody s else passing falsely accepted too ignobly for his to think how servile he might have been was absolutely to respect himself was in fact as much as he liked to admire himself as free the very finest spring that ever responded to his touch was always there to press the memory of his freedom as dawning upon him like a sunrise all pink and silver during a winter divided between florence rome and naples some three years after his wife s death it was the hushed daybreak of the roman revelation in particular that he could usually best recover with the way that there above all where the princes and popes had been before him his divination of his faculty most went to his head he was a plain american citizen staying at an hotel where sometimes for days together there were twenty others like him but no pope no prince of them all had read a richer meaning he believed into the character of the patron of art he was ashamed of them really if he wasn t afraid and he had on the whole never so climbed to the tip top as in judging over a perusal of hermann grimm where julius ii and leo x were placed by their treatment of michael angelo far below the plain american citizen in the case at least in which this personage happened not to be too plain to be adam verver going to our friend s head moreover some of the results of such comparisons may doubtless be described as having stayed there his freedom to see of which the comparisons were part what could it do but steadily grow and grow it came perhaps even too much to stand to him for all freedom since for example it was as much there as ever at the very time of mrs rance s conspiring against him at fawns with the billiard room and the sunday morning on the occasion round which we have perhaps drawn our circle too wide mrs rance at least controlled practically each other license of the present and the near future the license to pass the hour as he would have found convenient the license to stop remembering for a little that though if proposed to and not only by this aspirant but by any other he wouldn t prove foolish the proof of wisdom was none the less in such a fashion rather cruelly conditioned the license in especial to proceed from his letters to his journals and insulate orientate himself afresh by the sound over his gained interval of the many mouthed monster the exercise of whose lungs he so constantly stimulated mrs rance remained with him till the others came back from church and it was by that time clearer than ever that his ordeal when it should arrive would be really most unpleasant his impression this was the point took somehow the form not so much of her wanting to press home her own advantage as of her building better than she knew that is of her symbolising with virtual unconsciousness his own special deficiency his unfortunate lack of a wife to whom applications could be referred the applications the contingencies with which mrs rance struck him as potentially bristling were not of a sort really to be met by one s self and the possibility of them when his visitor said or as good as said i m restrained you see because of mr rance and also because i m proud and refined but if it wasn t for mr rance and for my refinement and my pride the possibility of them i say turned to a great murmurous rustle of a volume to fill the future a rustle of petticoats of scented many paged letters of voices as to which distinguish themselves as they might from each other it mattered little in what part of the resounding country they had learned to make themselves prevail the assinghams and the miss lutches had taken the walk through the park to the little old church on the property that our friend had often found himself wishing he were able to transport as it stood for its simple sweetness in a glass case to one of his exhibitory halls while maggie had induced her husband not inveterate in such practices to make with her by carriage the somewhat longer pilgrimage to the nearest altar modest though it happened to be of the faith her own as it had been her mother s and as mr verver himself had been loosely willing always to let it be taken for his without the solid ease of which making the stage firm and smooth the drama of her marriage might not have been acted out what at last appeared to have happened however was that the divided parties coming back at the same moment had met outside and then drifted together from empty room to room yet not in mere aimless quest of the pair of companions they had left at home the quest had carried them to the door of the billiard room and their appearance as it opened to admit them determined for adam verver in the oddest way in the world a new and sharp perception it was really remarkable this perception expanded on the spot as a flower one of the strangest might at a breath have suddenly opened the breath for that matter was more than anything else the look in his daughter s eyes the look with which he saw her take in exactly what had occurred in her absence mrs rance s pursuit of him to this remote locality the spirit and the very form perfectly characteristic of his acceptance of the complication the seal set in short unmistakably on one of maggie s anxieties the anxiety it was true would have been even though not imparted separately shared for fanny assingham s face was by the same stroke not at all thickly veiled for him and a queer light of a colour quite to match fairly glittered in the four fine eyes of the miss lutches each of these persons counting out that is the prince and the colonel who didn t care and who didn t even see that the others did knew something or had at any rate had her idea the idea precisely that this was what mrs rance artfully biding her time would do the special shade of apprehension on the part of the miss lutches might indeed have suggested the vision of an energy supremely asserted it was droll in truth if one came to that the position of the miss lutches they had themselves brought they had guilelessly introduced mrs rance strong in the fact of mr rance s having been literally beheld of them and it was now for them positively as if their handful of flowers since mrs rance was a handful had been but the vehicle of a dangerous snake mr verver fairly felt in the air the miss lutches imputation in the intensity of which really his own propriety might have been involved that none the less was but a flicker what made the real difference as i have hinted was his mute passage with maggie his daughter s anxiety alone had depths and it opened out for him the wider that it was altogether new when in their common past when till this moment had she shown a fear however dumbly for his individual life they had had fears together just as they had had joys but all of hers at least had been for what equally concerned them here of a sudden was a question that concerned him alone and the soundless explosion of it somehow marked a date he was on her mind he was even in a manner on her hands as a distinct thing that is from being where he had always been merely deep in her heart and in her life too deep down as it were to be disengaged contrasted or opposed in short objectively presented but time finally had done it their relation was altered he saw again the difference lighted for her this marked it to himself and it wasn t a question simply of a mrs rance the more or the less for maggie too at a stroke almost beneficently their visitor had from being an inconvenience become a sign they had made vacant by their marriage his immediate foreground his personal precinct they being the princess and the prince they had made room in it for others so others had become aware he became aware himself for that matter during the minute maggie stood there before speaking and with the sense moreover of what he saw her see he had the sense of what she saw him this last it may be added would have been his intensest perception had there not the next instant been more for him in fanny assingham her face couldn t keep it from him she had seen on top of everything in her quick way what they both were seeing ix so much mute communication was doubtless all this time marvellous and we may confess to having perhaps read into the scene prematurely a critical character that took longer to develop yet the quiet hour of reunion enjoyed that afternoon by the father and the daughter did really little else than deal with the elements definitely presented to each in the vibration produced by the return of the church goers nothing allusive nothing at all insistent passed between them either before or immediately after luncheon except indeed so far as their failure soon again to meet might be itself an accident charged with reference the hour or two after luncheon and on sundays with especial rigour for one of the domestic reasons of which it belonged to maggie quite multitudinously to take account were habitually spent by the princess with her little boy in whose apartment she either frequently found her father already established or was sooner or later joined by him his visit to his grandson at some hour or other held its place in his day against all interventions and this without counting his grandson s visits to him scarcely less ordered and timed and the odd bits as he called them that they picked up together when they could communions snatched for the most part on the terrace in the gardens or the park while the principino with much pomp and circumstance of perambulator parasol fine lace over veiling and incorruptible female attendance took the air in the private apartments which occupying in the great house the larger part of a wing of their own were not much more easily accessible than if the place had been a royal palace and the small child an heir apparent in the nursery of nurseries the talk at these instituted times was always so prevailingly with or about the master of the scene that other interests and other topics had fairly learned to avoid the slighting and inadequate notice there taken of them they came in at the best but as involved in the little boy s future his past or his comprehensive present never getting so much as a chance to plead their own merits or to complain of being neglected nothing perhaps in truth had done more than this united participation to confirm in the elder parties that sense of a life not only uninterrupted but more deeply associated more largely combined of which on adam verver s behalf we have made some mention it was of course an old story and a familiar idea that a beautiful baby could take its place as a new link between a wife and a husband but maggie and her father had with every ingenuity converted the precious creature into a link between a mamma and a grandpapa the principino for a chance spectator of this process might have become by an untoward stroke a hapless half orphan with the place of immediate male parent swept bare and open to the next nearest sympathy they had no occasion thus the conjoined worshippers to talk of what the prince might be or might do for his son the sum of service in his absence so completely filled itself out it was not in the least moreover that there was doubt of him for he was conspicuously addicted to the manipulation of the child in the frank italian way at such moments as he judged discreet in respect to other claims conspicuously indeed that is for maggie who had more occasion on the whole to speak to her husband of the extravagance of her father than to speak to her father of the extravagance of her husband adam verver had all round in this connection his own serenity he was sure of his son in law s auxiliary admiration admiration he meant of his grand son since to begin with what else had been at work but the instinct or it might fairly have been the tradition of the latter s making the child so solidly beautiful as to have to be admired what contributed most to harmony in this play of relations however was the way the young man seemed to leave it to be gathered that tradition for tradition the grandpapa s own was not in any estimate to go for nothing a tradition or whatever it was that had flowered prelusively in the princess herself well amerigo s very discretions were his way of taking account of it his discriminations in respect to his heir were in fine not more angular than any others to be observed in him and mr verver received perhaps from no source so distinct an impression of being for him an odd and important phenomenon as he received from this impunity of appropriation these unchallenged nursery hours it was as if the grandpapa s special show of the character were but another side for the observer to study another item for him to note it came back this latter personage knew to his own previous perception that of the prince s inability in any matter in which he was concerned to conclude the idiosyncrasy for him at each stage had to be demonstrated on which however he admirably accepted it this last was after all the point he really worked poor young man for acceptance since he worked so constantly for comprehension and how when you came to that could you know that a horse wouldn t shy at a brass band in a country road because it didn t shy at a traction engine it might have been brought up to traction engines without having been brought up to brass bands little by little thus from month to month the prince was learning what his wife s father had been brought up to and now it could be checked off he had been brought up to the romantic view of principini who would have thought it and where would it all stop the only fear somewhat sharp for mr verver was a certain fear of disappointing him for strangeness he felt that the evidence he offered thus viewed was too much on the positive side he didn t know he was learning and it was funny for him to how many things he had been brought up if the prince could only strike something to which he hadn t this wouldn t it seemed to him ruffle the smoothness and yet might a little add to the interest what was now clear at all events for the father and the daughter was their simply knowing they wanted for the time to be together at any cost as it were and their necessity so worked in them as to bear them out of the house in a quarter hidden from that in which their friends were gathered and cause them to wander unseen unfollowed along a covered walk in the old garden as it was called old with an antiquity of formal things high box and shaped yew and expanses of brick wall that had turned at once to purple and to pink they went out of a door in the wall a door that had a slab with a date set above it but in the old multiplied lettering and then had before them a small white gate intensely white and clean amid all the greenness through which they gradually passed to where some of the grandest trees spaciously clustered and where they would find one of the quietest places a bench had been placed long ago beneath a great oak that helped to crown a mild eminence and the ground sank away below it to rise again opposite at a distance sufficient to enclose the solitude and figure a bosky horizon summer blissfully was with them yet and the low sun made a splash of light where it pierced the looser shade maggie coming down to go out had brought a parasol which as over her charming bare head she now handled it gave with the big straw hat that her father in these days always wore a good deal tipped back definite intention to their walk they knew the bench it was sequestered they had praised it for that together before and liked the word and after they had begun to linger there they could have smiled if they hadn t been really too serious and if the question hadn t so soon ceased to matter over the probable wonder of the others as to what would have become of them the extent to which they enjoyed their indifference to any judgment of their want of ceremony what did that of itself speak but for the way that as a rule they almost equally had others on their mind they each knew that both were full of the superstition of not hurting but might precisely have been asking themselves asking in fact each other at this moment whether that was to be after all the last word of their conscientious development certain it was at all events that in addition to the assinghams and the lutches and mrs rance the attendance at tea just in the right place on the west terrace might perfectly comprise the four or five persons among them the very pretty the typically irish miss maddock vaunted announced and now brought from the couple of other houses near enough one of these the minor residence of their proprietor established thriftily while he hired out his ancestral home within sight and sense of his profit it was not less certain either that for once in a way the group in question must all take the case as they found it fanny assingham at any time for that matter might perfectly be trusted to see mr verver and his daughter to see their reputation for a decent friendliness through any momentary danger might be trusted even to carry off their absence for amerigo for amerigo s possible funny italian anxiety amerigo always being as the princess was well aware conveniently amenable to this friend s explanations beguilements reassurances and perhaps in fact rather more than less dependent on them as his new life since that was his own name for it opened out it was no secret to maggie it was indeed positively a public joke for her that she couldn t explain as mrs assingham did and that the prince liking explanations liking them almost as if he collected them in the manner of book plates or postage stamps for themselves his requisition of this luxury had to be met he didn t seem to want them as yet for use rather for ornament and amusement innocent amusement of the kind he most fancied and that was so characteristic of his blessed beautiful general slightly indolent lack of more dissipated or even just of more sophisticated tastes however that might be the dear woman had come to be frankly and gaily recognised and not least by herself as filling in the intimate little circle an office that was not always a sinecure it was almost as if she had taken with her kind melancholy colonel at her heels a responsible engagement to be within call as it were for all those appeals that sprang out of talk that sprang not a little doubtless too out of leisure it naturally led her position in the household as she called it to considerable frequency of presence to visits from the good couple freely repeated and prolonged and not so much as under form of protest she was there to keep him quiet it was amerigo s own description of her influence and it would only have needed a more visible disposition to unrest in him to make the account perfectly fit fanny herself limited indeed she minimised her office you didn t need a jailor she contended for a domesticated lamb tied up with pink ribbon this was not an animal to be controlled it was an animal to be at the most educated she admitted accordingly that she was educative which maggie was so aware that she herself inevitably wasn t so it came round to being true that what she was most in charge of was his mere intelligence this left goodness knew plenty of different calls for maggie to meet in a case in which so much pink ribbon as it might be symbolically named was lavished on the creature what it all amounted to at any rate was that mrs assingham would be keeping him quiet now while his wife and his father in law carried out their own little frugal picnic quite moreover doubtless not much less neededly in respect to the members of the circle that were with them there than in respect to the pair they were missing almost for the first time it was present to maggie that the prince could bear when he was with his wife almost any queerness on the part of people strange english types who bored him beyond convenience by being so little as he himself was for this was one of the ways in which a wife was practically sustaining but she was as positively aware that she hadn t yet learned to see him as meeting such exposure in her absence how did he move and talk how above all did he or how would he look he who with his so nobly handsome face could look such wonderful things in case of being left alone with some of the subjects of his wonder there were subjects for wonder among these very neighbours only maggie herself had her own odd way which didn t moreover the least irritate him of really liking them in proportion as they could strike her as strange it came out in her by heredity he amused himself with declaring this love of chinoiseries but she actually this evening didn t mind he might deal with her chinese as he could maggie indeed would always have had for such moments had they oftener occurred the impression made on her by a word of mrs assingham s a word referring precisely to that appetite in amerigo for the explanatory which we have just found in our path it wasn t that the princess could be indebted to another person even to so clever a one as this friend for seeing anything in her husband that she mightn t see unaided but she had ever hitherto been of a nature to accept with modest gratitude any better description of a felt truth than her little limits terribly marked she knew in the direction of saying the right things enabled her to make thus it was at any rate that she was able to live more or less in the light of the fact expressed so lucidly by their common comforter the fact that the prince was saving up for some very mysterious but very fine eventual purpose all the wisdom all the answers to his questions all the impressions and generalisations he gathered putting them away and packing them down because he wanted his great gun to be loaded to the brim on the day he should decide to let it off he wanted first to make sure of the whole of the subject that was unrolling itself before him after which the innumerable facts he had collected would find their use he knew what he was about trust him at last therefore to make and to some effect his big noise and mrs assingham had repeated that he knew what he was about it was the happy form of this assurance that had remained with maggie it could always come in for her that amerigo knew what he was about he might at moments seem vague seem absent seem even bored this when away from her father with whom it was impossible for him to appear anything but respectfully occupied he let his native gaiety go in outbreaks of song or even of quite whimsical senseless sound either expressive of intimate relaxation or else fantastically plaintive he might at times reflect with the frankest lucidity on the circumstance that the case was for a good while yet absolutely settled in regard to what he still had left at home of his very own in regard to the main seat of his affection the house in rome the big black palace the palazzo nero as he was fond of naming it and also on the question of the villa in the sabine hills which she had at the time of their engagement seen and yearned over and the castello proper described by him always as the perched place that had as she knew formerly stood up on the pedestal of its mountain slope showing beautifully blue from afar as the head and front of the princedom he might rejoice in certain moods over the so long estranged state of these properties not indeed all irreclaimably alienated but encumbered with unending leases and charges with obstinate occupants with impossibilities of use all without counting the cloud of mortgages that had from far back buried them beneath the ashes of rage and remorse a shroud as thick as the layer once resting on the towns at the foot of vesuvius and actually making of any present restorative effort a process much akin to slow excavation just so he might with another turn of his humour almost wail for these brightest spots of his lost paradise declaring that he was an idiot not to be able to bring himself to face the sacrifices sacrifices resting if definitely anywhere with mr verver necessary for winning them back one of the most comfortable things between the husband and the wife meanwhile one of those easy certitudes they could be merely gay about was that she never admired him so much or so found him heartbreakingly handsome clever irresistible in the very degree in which he had originally and fatally dawned upon her as when she saw other women reduced to the same passive pulp that had then begun once for all to constitute her substance there was really nothing they had talked of together with more intimate and familiar pleasantry than of the license and privilege the boundless happy margin thus established for each she going so far as to put it that even should he some day get drunk and beat her the spectacle of him with hated rivals would after no matter what extremity always for the sovereign charm of it charm of it in itself and as the exhibition of him that most deeply moved her suffice to bring her round what would therefore be more open to him than to keep her in love with him he agreed with all his heart at these light moments that his course wouldn t then be difficult inasmuch as so simply constituted as he was on all the precious question and why should he be ashamed of it he knew but one way with the fair they had to be fair and he was fastidious and particular his standard was high but when once this was the case what relation with them was conceivable what relation was decent rudimentary properly human but that of a plain interest in the fairness his interest she always answered happened not to be plain and plainness all round had little to do with the matter which was marked on the contrary by the richest variety of colour but the working basis at all events had been settled the miss maddocks of life been assured of their importance for him how conveniently assured maggie to take him too into the joke had more than once gone so far as to mention to her father since it fell in easily with the tenderness of her disposition to remember she might occasionally make him happy by an intimate confidence this was one of her rules full as she was of little rules considerations provisions there were things she of course couldn t tell him in so many words about amerigo and herself and about their happiness and their union and their deepest depths and there were other things she needn t but there were also those that were both true and amusing both communicable and real and of these with her so conscious so delicately cultivated scheme of conduct as a daughter she could make her profit at will a pleasant hush for that matter had fallen on most of the elements while she lingered apart with her companion it involved this serenity innumerable complete assumptions since so ordered and so splendid a rest all the tokens spreading about them of confidence solidly supported might have suggested for persons of poorer pitch the very insolence of facility still they weren t insolent they weren t our pair could reflect they were only blissful and grateful and personally modest not ashamed of knowing with competence when great things were great when good things were good and when safe things were safe and not therefore placed below their fortune by timidity which would have been as bad as being below it by impudence worthy of it as they were and as each appears under our last possible analysis to have wished to make the other feel that they were what they most finally exhaled into the evening air as their eyes mildly met may well have been a kind of helplessness in their felicity their rightness the justification of everything something they so felt the pulse of sat there with them but they might have been asking themselves a little blankly to what further use they could put anything so perfect they had created and nursed and established it they had housed it here in dignity and crowned it with comfort but mightn t the moment possibly count for them or count at least for us while we watch them with their fate all before them as the dawn of the discovery that it doesn t always meet all contingencies to be right otherwise why should maggie have found a word of definite doubt the expression of the fine pang determined in her a few hours before rise after a time to her lips she took so for granted moreover her companion s intelligence of her doubt that the mere vagueness of her question could say it all what is it after all that they want to do to you they were for the princess too the hovering forces of which mrs rance was the symbol and her father only smiling back now at his ease took no trouble to appear not to know what she meant what she meant when once she had spoken could come out well enough though indeed it was nothing after they had come to the point that could serve as ground for a great defensive campaign the waters of talk spread a little and maggie presently contributed an idea in saying what has really happened is that the proportions for us are altered he accepted equally for the time this somewhat cryptic remark he still failed to challenge her even when she added that it wouldn t so much matter if he hadn t been so terribly young he uttered a sound of protest only when she went to declare that she ought as a daughter in common decency to have waited yet by that time she was already herself admitting that she should have had to wait long if she waited that is till he was old but there was a way since you are an irresistible youth we ve got to face it that somehow is what that woman has made me feel there ll be others x to talk of it thus appeared at last a positive relief to him yes there ll be others but you ll see me through she hesitated do you mean if you give in oh no through my holding out maggie waited again but when she spoke it had an effect of abruptness why should you hold out forever he gave none the less no start and this as from the habit of taking anything taking everything from her as harmonious but it was quite written upon him too for that matter that holding out wouldn t be so very completely his natural or at any rate his acquired form his appearance would have testified that he might have to do so a long time for a man so greatly beset this appearance that is spoke but little as yet of short remainders and simplified senses and all in spite of his being a small spare slightly stale person deprived of the general prerogative of presence it was not by mass or weight or vulgar immediate quantity that he would in the future any more than he had done in the past insist or resist or prevail there was even something in him that made his position on any occasion made his relation to any scene or to any group a matter of the back of the stage of an almost visibly conscious want of affinity with the footlights he would have figured less than anything the stage manager or the author of the play who most occupy the foreground he might be at the best the financial backer watching his interests from the wing but in rather confessed ignorance of the mysteries of mimicry barely taller than his daughter he pressed at no point on the presumed propriety of his greater stoutness he had lost early in life much of his crisp closely curling hair the fineness of which was repeated in a small neat beard too compact to be called full though worn equally as for a mark where other marks were wanting on lip and cheek and chin his neat colourless face provided with the merely indispensable features suggested immediately for a description that it was clear and in this manner somewhat resembled a small decent room clean swept and unencumbered with furniture but drawing a particular advantage as might presently be noted from the outlook of a pair of ample and uncurtained windows there was something in adam verver s eyes that both admitted the morning and the evening in unusual quantities and gave the modest area the outward extension of a view that was big even when restricted to stars deeply and changeably blue though not romantically large they were yet youthfully almost strangely beautiful with their ambiguity of your scarce knowing if they most carried their possessor s vision out or most opened themselves to your own whatever you might feel they stamped the place with their importance as the house agents say so that on one side or the other you were never out of their range were moving about for possible community opportunity the sight of you scarce knew what either before them or behind them if other importances not to extend the question kept themselves down they were in no direction less obtruded than in that of our friend s dress adopted once for all as with a sort of sumptuary scruple he wore every day of the year whatever the occasion the same little black cut away coat of the fashion of his younger time he wore the same cool looking trousers chequered in black and white the proper harmony with which he inveterately considered was a sprigged blue satin necktie and over his concave little stomach quaintly indifferent to climates and seasons a white duck waistcoat should you really he now asked like me to marry he spoke as if coming from his daughter herself it might be an idea which for that matter he would be ready to carry out should she definitely say so definite however just yet she was not prepared to be though it seemed to come to her with force as she thought that there was a truth in the connection to utter what i feel is that there is somehow something that used to be right and that i ve made wrong it used to be right that you hadn t married and that you didn t seem to want to it used also she continued to make out to seem easy for the question not to come up that s what i ve made different it does come up it will come up you don t think i can keep it down mr verver s tone was cheerfully pensive well i ve given you by my move all the trouble of having to he liked the tenderness of her idea and it made him as she sat near him pass his arm about her i guess i don t feel as if you had moved very far you ve only moved next door well she continued i don t feel as if it were fair for me just to have given you a push and left you so if i ve made the difference for you i must think of the difference then what darling he indulgently asked do you think that s just what i don t yet know but i must find out we must think together as we ve always thought what i mean she went on after a moment is that it strikes me that i ought to at least offer you some alternative i ought to have worked one out for you an alternative to what well to your simply missing what you ve lost without anything being done about it but what have i lost she thought a minute as if it were difficult to say yet as if she more and more saw it well whatever it was that before kept us from thinking and kept you really as you might say in the market it was as if you couldn t be in the market when you were married to me or rather as if i kept people off innocently by being married to you now that i m married to some one else you re as in consequence married to nobody therefore you may be married to anybody to everybody people don t see why you shouldn t be married to them isn t it enough of a reason he mildly inquired that i don t want to be it s enough of a reason yes but to be enough of a reason it has to be too much of a trouble i mean for you it has to be too much of a fight you ask me what you ve lost maggie continued to explain the not having to take the trouble and to make the fight that s what you ve lost the advantage the happiness of being just as you were because i was just as i was that s what you miss so that you think her father presently said that i had better get married just in order to be as i was before the detached tone of it detached as if innocently to amuse her by showing his desire to accommodate was so far successful as to draw from her gravity a short light laugh well what i don t want you to feel is that if you were to i shouldn t understand i should understand that s all said the princess gently her companion turned it pleasantly over you don t go so far as to wish me to take somebody i don t like ah father she sighed you know how far i go how far i could go but i only wish that if you ever should like anybody you may never doubt of my feeling how i ve brought you to it you ll always know that i know that it s my fault you mean he went on in his contemplative way that it will be you who ll take the consequences maggie just considered i ll leave you all the good ones but i ll take the bad well that s handsome he emphasised his sense of it by drawing her closer and holding her more tenderly it s about all i could expect of you so far as you ve wronged me therefore we ll call it square i ll let you know in time if i see a prospect of your having to take it up but am i to understand meanwhile he soon went on that ready as you are to see me through my collapse you re not ready or not as ready to see me through my resistance i ve got to be a regular martyr before you ll be inspired she demurred at his way of putting it why if you like it you know it won t be a collapse then why talk about seeing me through at all i shall only collapse if i do like it but what i seem to feel is that i don t want to like it that is he amended unless i feel surer i do than appears very probable i don t want to have to think i like it in a case when i really shan t i ve had to do that in some cases he confessed when it has been a question of other things i don t want he wound up to be made to make a mistake ah but it s too dreadful she returned that you should even have to fear or just nervously to dream that you may be what does that show after all she asked but that you do really well within feel a want what does it show but that you re truly susceptible well it may show that he defended himself against nothing but it shows also i think that charming women are in the kind of life we re leading now numerous and formidable maggie entertained for a moment the proposition under cover of which however she passed quickly from the general to the particular do you feel mrs rance to be charming well i feel her to be formidable when they cast a spell it comes to the same thing i think she d do anything oh well i d help you the princess said with decision as against her if that s all you require it s too funny she went on before he again spoke that mrs rance should be here at all but if you talk of the life we lead much of it is altogether i m bound to say too funny the thing is maggie developed under this impression that i don t think we lead as regards other people any life at all we don t at any rate it seems to me lead half the life we might and so it seems i think to amerigo so it seems also i m sure to fanny assingham mr verver as if from due regard for these persons considered a little what life would they like us to lead oh it s not a question i think on which they quite feel together she thinks dear fanny that we ought to be greater greater he echoed it vaguely and amerigo too you say ah yes her reply was prompt but amerigo doesn t mind he doesn t care i mean what we do it s for us he considers to see things exactly as we wish fanny herself maggie pursued thinks he s magnificent magnificent i mean for taking everything as it is for accepting the social limitations of our life for not missing what we don t give him mr verver attended then if he doesn t miss it his magnificence is easy it is easy that s exactly what i think if there were things he did miss and if in spite of them he were always sweet then no doubt he would be a more or less unappreciated hero he could be a hero he will be one if it s ever necessary but it will be about something better than our dreariness i know the princess declared where he s magnificent and she rested a minute on that she ended however as she had begun we re not all the same committed to anything stupid if we ought to be grander as fanny thinks we can be grander there s nothing to prevent is it a strict moral obligation adam verver inquired no it s for the amusement for whose for fanny s own for everyone s though i dare say fanny s would be a large part she hesitated she had now it might have appeared something more to bring out which she finally produced for yours in particular say if you go into the question she even bravely followed it up i haven t really after all had to think much to see that much more can be done for you than is done mr verver uttered an odd vague sound don t you think a good deal is done when you come out and talk to me this way ah said his daughter smiling at him we make too much of that and then to explain that s good and it s natural but it isn t great we forget that we re as free as air well that s great mr verver pleaded great if we act on it not if we don t she continued to smile and he took her smile wondering again a little by this time however struck more and more by an intensity in it that belied a light tone what do you want he demanded to do to me and he added as she didn t say you ve got something in your mind it had come to him within the minute that from the beginning of their session there she had been keeping something back and that an impression of this had more than once in spite of his general theoretic respect for her present right to personal reserves and mysteries almost ceased to be vague in him there had been from the first something in her anxious eyes in the way she occasionally lost herself that it would perfectly explain he was therefore now quite sure you ve got something up your sleeve she had a silence that made him right well when i tell you you ll understand it s only up my sleeve in the sense of being in a letter i got this morning all day yes it has been in my mind i ve been asking myself if it were quite the right moment or in any way fair to ask you if you could stand just now another woman it relieved him a little yet the beautiful consideration of her manner made it in a degree portentous stand one well mind her coming he stared then he laughed it depends on who she is there you see i ve at all events been thinking whether you d take this particular person but as a worry the more whether that is you d go so far with her in your notion of having to be kind he gave at this the quickest shake to his foot how far would she go in her notion of it well his daughter returned you know how far in a general way charlotte stant goes charlotte is she coming she writes me practically that she d like to if we re so good as to ask her mr verver continued to gaze but rather as if waiting for more then as everything appeared to have come his expression had a drop if this was all it was simple then why in the world not maggie s face lighted anew but it was now another light it isn t a want of tact to ask her to propose it to you that i should ask her he put the question as an effect of his remnant of vagueness but this had also its own effect maggie wondered an instant after which as with a flush of recognition she took it up it would be too beautiful if you would this clearly had not been her first idea the chance of his words had prompted it do you mean write to her myself yes it would be kind it would be quite beautiful of you that is of course said maggie if you sincerely can he appeared to wonder an instant why he sincerely shouldn t and indeed for that matter where the question of sincerity came in this virtue between him and his daughter s friend had surely been taken for granted my dear child he returned i don t think i m afraid of charlotte well that s just what it s lovely to have from you from the moment you re not the least little bit i ll immediately invite her but where in the world is she he spoke as if he had not thought of charlotte nor so much as heard her name pronounced for a very long time he quite in fact amicably almost amusedly woke up to her she s in brittany at a little bathing place with some people i don t know she s always with people poor dear she rather has to be even when as is sometimes the case they re people she doesn t immensely like well i guess she likes us said adam verver yes fortunately she likes us and if i wasn t afraid of spoiling it for you maggie added i d even mention that you re not the one of our number she likes least why should that spoil it for me oh my dear you know what else have we been talking about it costs you so much to be liked that s why i hesitated to tell you of my letter he stared a moment as if the subject had suddenly grown out of recognition but charlotte on other visits never used to cost me anything no only her keep maggie smiled then i don t think i mind her keep if that s all the princess however it was clear wished to be thoroughly conscientious well it may not be quite all if i think of its being pleasant to have her it s because she will make a difference well what s the harm in that if it s but a difference for the better ah then there you are and the princess showed in her smile her small triumphant wisdom if you acknowledge a possible difference for the better we re not after all so tremendously right as we are i mean we re not as satisfied and amused we do see there are ways of being grander but will charlotte stant her father asked with surprise make us grander maggie on this looking at him well had a remarkable reply yes i think really grander he thought for if this was a sudden opening he wished but the more to meet it because she s so handsome no father and the princess was almost solemn because she s so great great great in nature in character in spirit great in life so mr verver echoed what has she done in life well she has been brave and bright said maggie that mayn t sound like much but she has been so in the face of things that might well have made it too difficult for many other girls she hasn t a creature in the world really that is nearly belonging to her only acquaintances who in all sorts of ways make use of her and distant relations who are so afraid she ll make use of them that they seldom let her look at them mr verver was struck and as usual to some purpose if we get her here to improve us don t we too then make use of her it pulled the princess up however but an instant we re old old friends we do her good too i should always even at the worst speaking for myself admire her still more than i used her i see that always does good maggie hesitated certainly she knows it she knows i mean how great i think her courage and her cleverness she s not afraid not of anything and yet she no more ever takes a liberty with you than if she trembled for her life and then she s interesting which plenty of other people with plenty of other merits never are a bit in which fine flicker of vision the truth widened to the princess s view i myself of course don t take liberties but then i do always by nature tremble for my life that s the way i live oh i say love her father vaguely murmured yes i live in terror she insisted i m a small creeping thing you ll not persuade me that you re not as good as charlotte stant he still placidly enough remarked i may be as good but i m not so great and that s what we re talking about she has a great imagination she has in every way a great attitude she has above all a great conscience more perhaps than ever in her life before maggie addressed her father at this moment with a shade of the absolute in her tone she had never come so near telling him what he should take it from her to believe she has only twopence in the world but that has nothing to do with it or rather indeed she quickly corrected herself it has everything for she doesn t care i never saw her do anything but laugh at her poverty her life has been harder than anyone knows it was moreover as if thus unprecedentedly positive his child had an effect upon him that mr verver really felt as a new thing why then haven t you told me about her before well haven t we always known i should have thought he submitted that we had already pretty well sized her up certainly we long ago quite took her for granted but things change with time and i seem to know that after this interval i m going to like her better than ever i ve lived more myself i m older and one judges better yes i m going to see in charlotte said the princess and speaking now as with high and free expectation more than i ve ever seen then i ll try to do so too she was it came back to mr verver more the one of your friends i thought the best for you his companion however was so launched in her permitted liberty of appreciation that she for the moment scarce heard him she was lost in the case she made out the vision of the different ways in which charlotte had distinguished herself she would have liked for instance i m sure she would have liked extremely to marry and nothing in general is more ridiculous even when it has been pathetic than a woman who has tried and has not been able it had all mr verver s attention she has tried she has seen cases where she would have liked to but she has not been able well there are more cases in europe in which it doesn t come to girls who are poor than in which it does come to them especially said maggie with her continued competence when they re americans well her father now met her and met her cheerfully on all sides unless you mean he suggested that when the girls are american there are more cases in which it comes to the rich than to the poor she looked at him good humouredly that may be but i m not going to be smothered in my case it ought to make me if i were in danger of being a fool all the nicer to people like charlotte it s not hard for me she practically explained not to be ridiculous unless in a very different way i might easily be ridiculous i suppose by behaving as if i thought i had done a great thing charlotte at any rate has done nothing and anyone can see it and see also that it s rather strange and yet no one no one not awfully presumptuous or offensive would like or would dare to treat her just as she is as anything but quite right that s what it is to have something about you that carries things off mr verver s silence on this could only be a sign that she had caused her story to interest him though the sign when he spoke was perhaps even sharper and is it also what you mean by charlotte s being great well said maggie it s one of her ways but she has many again for a little her father considered and who is it she has tried to marry maggie on her side as well waited as if to bring it out with effect but she after a minute either renounced or encountered an obstacle i m afraid i m not sure then how do you know well i don t know and qualifying again she was earnestly emphatic i only make it out for myself but you must make it out about someone in particular she had another pause i don t think i want even for myself to put names and times to pull away any veil i ve an idea there has been more than once somebody i m not acquainted with and needn t be or want to be in any case it s all over and beyond giving her credit for everything it s none of my business mr verver deferred yet he discriminated i don t see how you can give credit without knowing the facts can t i give it generally for dignity dignity i mean in misfortune you ve got to postulate the misfortune first well said maggie i can do that isn t it always a misfortune to be when you re so fine so wasted and yet she went on not to wail about it not to look even as if you knew it mr verver seemed at first to face this as a large question and then after a little solicited by another view to let the appeal drop well she mustn t be wasted we won t at least have waste it produced in maggie s face another gratitude then dear sir that s all i want and it would apparently have settled their question and ended their talk if her father had not after a little shown the disposition to revert how many times are you supposing that she has tried once more at this and as if she hadn t been couldn t be hated to be in such delicate matters literal she was moved to attenuate oh i don t say she absolutely ever tried he looked perplexed but if she has so absolutely failed what then had she done she has suffered she has done that and the princess added she has loved and she has lost mr verver however still wondered but how many times maggie hesitated but it cleared up once is enough enough that is for one to be kind to her her father listened yet not challenging only as with a need of some basis on which under these new lights his bounty could be firm but has she told you nothing ah thank goodness no he stared then don t young women tell because you mean it s just what they re supposed to do she looked at him flushed again now with which after another hesitation do young men tell she asked he gave a short laugh how do i know my dear what young men do then how do i know father what vulgar girls do i see i see he quickly returned but she spoke the next moment as if she might odiously have been sharp what happens at least is that where there s a great deal of pride there s a great deal of silence i don t know i admit what i should do if i were lonely and sore for what sorrow to speak of have i ever had in my life i don t know even if i m proud it seems to me the question has never come up for me oh i guess you re proud mag her father cheerfully interposed i mean i guess you re proud enough well then i hope i m humble enough too i might at all events for all i know be abject under a blow how can i tell do you realise father that i ve never had the least blow he gave her a long quiet look who should realise if i don t well you ll realise when i have one she exclaimed with a short laugh that resembled as for good reasons his own of a minute before i wouldn t in any case have let her tell me what would have been dreadful to me for such wounds and shames are dreadful at least she added catching herself up i suppose they are for what as i say do i know of them i don t want to know she spoke quite with vehemence there are things that are sacred whether they re joys or pains but one can always for safety be kind she kept on one feels when that s right she had got up with these last words she stood there before him with that particular suggestion in her aspect to which even the long habit of their life together had not closed his sense kept sharp year after year by the collation of types and signs the comparison of fine object with fine object of one degree of finish of one form of the exquisite with another the appearance of some slight slim draped antique of vatican or capitoline halls late and refined rare as a note and immortal as a link set in motion by the miraculous infusion of a modern impulse and yet for all the sudden freedom of folds and footsteps forsaken after centuries by their pedestal keeping still the quality the perfect felicity of the statue the blurred absent eyes the smoothed elegant nameless head the impersonal flit of a creature lost in an alien age and passing as an image in worn relief round and round a precious vase she had always had odd moments of striking him daughter of his very own though she was as a figure thus simplified generalised in its grace a figure with which his human connection was fairly interrupted by some vague analogy of turn and attitude something shyly mythological and nymphlike the trick he was not uncomplacently aware was mainly of his own mind it came from his caring for precious vases only less than for precious daughters and what was more to the point still it often operated while he was quite at the same time conscious that maggie had been described even in her prettiness as prim mrs rance herself had enthusiastically used the word of her while he remembered that when once she had been told before him familiarly that she resembled a nun she had replied that she was delighted to hear it and would certainly try to while also finally it was present to him that discreetly heedless thanks to her long association with nobleness in art to the leaps and bounds of fashion she brought her hair down very straight and flat over her temples in the constant manner of her mother who had not been a bit mythological nymphs and nuns were certainly separate types but mr verver when he really amused himself let consistency go the play of vision was at all events so rooted in him that he could receive impressions of sense even while positively thinking he was positively thinking while maggie stood there and it led for him to yet another question which in its turn led to others still do you regard the condition as hers then that you spoke of a minute ago the condition why that of having loved so intensely that she s as you say beyond everything maggie had scarcely to reflect her answer was so prompt oh no she s beyond nothing for she has had nothing i see you must have had things to be them it s a kind of law of perspective maggie didn t know about the law but she continued definite she s not for example beyond help oh well then she shall have all we can give her i ll write to her he said with pleasure angel she answered as she gaily and tenderly looked at him true as this might be however there was one thing more he was an angel with a human curiosity has she told you she likes me much certainly she has told me but i won t pamper you let it be enough for you it has always been one of my reasons for liking her then she s indeed not beyond everything mr verver more or less humorously observed oh it isn t thank goodness that she s in love with you it s not as i told you at first the sort of thing for you to fear he had spoken with cheer but it appeared to drop before this reassurance as if the latter overdid his alarm and that should be corrected oh my dear i ve always thought of her as a little girl ah she s not a little girl said the princess then i ll write to her as a brilliant woman it s exactly what she is mr verver had got up as he spoke and for a little before retracing their steps they stood looking at each other as if they had really arranged something they had come out together for themselves but it had produced something more what it had produced was in fact expressed by the words with which he met his companion s last emphasis well she has a famous friend in you princess maggie took this in it was too plain for a protest do you know what i m really thinking of she asked he wondered with her eyes on him eyes of contentment at her freedom now to talk and he wasn t such a fool he presently showed as not suddenly to arrive at it why of your finding her at last yourself a husband good for you maggie smiled but it will take she added some looking then let me look right here with you her father said as they walked on xi mrs assingham and the colonel quitting fawns before the end of september had come back later on and now a couple of weeks after they were again interrupting their stay but this time with the question of their return left to depend on matters that were rather hinted at than importunately named the lutches and mrs rance had also by the action of charlotte stant s arrival ceased to linger though with hopes and theories as to some promptitude of renewal of which the lively expression awakening the echoes of the great stone paved oak panelled galleried hall that was not the least interesting feature of the place seemed still a property of the air it was on this admirable spot that before her october afternoon had waned fanny assingham spent with her easy host a few moments which led to her announcing her own and her husband s final secession at the same time as they tempted her to point the moral of all vain reverberations the double door of the house stood open to an effect of hazy autumn sunshine a wonderful windless waiting golden hour under the influence of which adam verver met his genial friend as she came to drop into the post box with her own hand a thick sheaf of letters they presently thereafter left the house together and drew out half an hour on the terrace in a manner they were to revert to in thought later on as that of persons who really had been taking leave of each other at a parting of the ways he traced his impression on coming to consider back to a mere three words she had begun by using about charlotte stant she simply cleared them out those had been the three words thrown off in reference to the general golden peace that the kentish october had gradually ushered in the halcyon days the full beauty of which had appeared to shine out for them after charlotte s arrival for it was during these days that mrs rance and the miss lutches had been observed to be gathering themselves for departure and it was with that difference made that the sense of the whole situation showed most fair the sense of how right they had been to engage for so ample a residence and of all the pleasure so fruity an autumn there could hold in its lap this was what had occurred that their lesson had been learned and what mrs assingham had dwelt upon was that without charlotte it would have been learned but half it would certainly not have been taught by mrs rance and the miss lutches if these ladies had remained with them as long as at one time seemed probable charlotte s light intervention had thus become a cause operating covertly but none the less actively and fanny assingham s speech which she had followed up a little echoed within him fairly to startle him as the indication of something irresistible he could see now how this superior force had worked and he fairly liked to recover the sight little harm as he dreamed of doing little ill as he dreamed of wishing the three ladies whom he had after all entertained for a stiffish series of days she had been so vague and quiet about it wonderful charlotte that he hadn t known what was happening happening that is as a result of her influence their fires as they felt her turned to smoke mrs assingham remarked which he was to reflect on indeed even while they strolled he had retained since his long talk with maggie the talk that had settled the matter of his own direct invitation to her friend an odd little taste as he would have described it for hearing things said about this young woman hearing so to speak what could be said about her almost as it her portrait by some eminent hand were going on so that he watched it grow under the multiplication of touches mrs assingham it struck him applied two or three of the finest in their discussion of their young friend so different a figure now from that early playmate of maggie s as to whom he could almost recall from of old the definite occasions of his having paternally lumped the two children together in the recommendation that they shouldn t make too much noise nor eat too much jam his companion professed that in the light of charlotte s prompt influence she had not been a stranger to a pang of pity for their recent visitors i felt in fact privately so sorry for them that i kept my impression to myself while they were here wishing not to put the rest of you on the scent neither maggie nor the prince nor yourself nor even charlotte herself if you didn t happen to notice since you didn t apparently i perhaps now strike you as extravagant but i m not i followed it all one saw the consciousness i speak of come over the poor things very much as i suppose people at the court of the borgias may have watched each other begin to look queer after having had the honour of taking wine with the heads of the family my comparison s only a little awkward for i don t in the least mean that charlotte was consciously dropping poison into their cup she was just herself their poison in the sense of mortally disagreeing with them but she didn t know it ah she didn t know it mr verver had asked with interest well i think she didn t mrs assingham had to admit that she hadn t pressingly sounded her i don t pretend to be sure in every connection of what charlotte knows she doesn t certainly like to make people suffer not in general as is the case with so many of us even other women she likes much rather to put them at their ease with her she likes that is as all pleasant people do to be liked ah she likes to be liked her companion had gone on she did at the same time no doubt want to help us to put us at our ease that is she wanted to put you and to put maggie about you so far as that went she had a plan but it was only after it was not before i really believe that she saw how effectively she could work again as mr verver felt he must have taken it up ah she wanted to help us wanted to help me why mrs assingham asked after an instant should it surprise you he just thought oh it doesn t she saw of course as soon as she came with her quickness where we all were she didn t need each of us to go by appointment to her room at night or take her out into the fields for our palpitating tale no doubt even she was rather impatient of the poor things mr verver had here inquired while he waited well of your not yourselves being so and of your not in particular i haven t the least doubt in the world par exemple that she thinks you too meek oh she thinks me too meek and she had been sent for on the very face of it to work right in all she had to do after all was to be nice to you to a me said adam verver he could remember now that his friend had positively had a laugh for his tone to you and to every one she had only to be what she is and to be it all round if she s charming how can she help it so it was and so only that she acted as the borgia wine used to act one saw it come over them the extent to which in her particular way a woman a woman other and so other than themselves could be charming one saw them understand and exchange looks then one saw them lose heart and decide to move for what they had to take home was that it s she who s the real thing ah it s she who s the real thing as he had not hitherto taken it home as completely as the miss lutches and mrs rance so doubtless he had now a little appeared to offer submission in his appeal i see i see he could at least simply take it home now yet as not without wanting at the same time to be sure of what the real thing was and what would it be a definitely that you understand by that she had only for an instant not found it easy to say why exactly what those women themselves want to be and what her effect on them is to make them recognise that they never will oh of course never it not only remained and abode with them it positively developed and deepened after this talk that the luxurious side of his personal existence was now again furnished socially speaking with the thing classed and stamped as real just as he had been able to think of it as not otherwise enriched in consequence of his daughter s marriage the note of reality in so much projected light continued to have for him the charm and the importance of which the maximum had occasionally been reached in his great finds continued beyond any other to keep him attentive and gratified nothing perhaps might affect us as queerer had we time to look into it than this application of the same measure of value to such different pieces of property as old persian carpets say and new human acquisitions all the more indeed that the amiable man was not without an inkling on his own side that he was as a taster of life economically constructed he put into his one little glass everything he raised to his lips and it was as if he had always carried in his pocket like a tool of his trade this receptacle a little glass cut with a fineness of which the art had long since been lost and kept in an old morocco case stamped in uneffaceable gilt with the arms of a deposed dynasty as it had served him to satisfy himself so to speak both about amerigo and about the bernadino luini he had happened to come to knowledge of at the time he was consenting to the announcement of his daughter s betrothal so it served him at present to satisfy himself about charlotte stant and an extraordinary set of oriental tiles of which he had lately got wind to which a provoking legend was attached and as to which he had made out contentedly that further news was to be obtained from a certain mr gutermann seuss of brighton it was all at bottom in him the aesthetic principle planted where it could burn with a cold still flame where it fed almost wholly on the material directly involved on the idea followed by appropriation of plastic beauty of the thing visibly perfect in its kind where in short in spite of the general tendency of the devouring element to spread the rest of his spiritual furniture modest scattered and tended with unconscious care escaped the consumption that in so many cases proceeds from the undue keeping up of profane altar fires adam verver had in other words learnt the lesson of the senses to the end of his own little book without having for a day raised the smallest scandal in his economy at large being in this particular not unlike those fortunate bachelors or other gentlemen of pleasure who so manage their entertainment of compromising company that even the austerest housekeeper occupied and competent below stairs never feels obliged to give warning that figure has however a freedom that the occasion doubtless scarce demands though we may retain it for its rough negative value it was to come to pass by a pressure applied to the situation wholly from within that before the first ten days of november had elapsed he found himself practically alone at fawns with his young friend amerigo and maggie having with a certain abruptness invited his assent to their going abroad for a month since his amusement was now scarce less happily assured than his security an impulse eminently natural had stirred within the prince his life as for some time established was deliciously dull and thereby on the whole what he best liked but a small gust of yearning had swept over him and maggie repeated to her father with infinite admiration the pretty terms in which after it had lasted a little he had described to her this experience he called it a serenade a low music that outside one of the windows of the sleeping house disturbed his rest at night timid as it was and plaintive he yet couldn t close his eyes for it and when finally rising on tiptoe he had looked out he had recognised in the figure below with a mandolin all duskily draped in her grace the raised appealing eyes and the one irresistible voice of the ever to be loved italy sooner or later that way one had to listen it was a hovering haunting ghost as of a creature to whom one had done a wrong a dim pathetic shade crying out to be comforted for this there was obviously but one way as there were doubtless also many words for the simple fact that so prime a roman had a fancy for again seeing rome they would accordingly hadn t they better go for a little maggie meanwhile making the too absurdly artful point with her father so that he repeated it in his amusement to charlotte stant to whom he was by this time conscious of addressing many remarks that it was absolutely when she came to think the first thing amerigo had ever asked of her she doesn t count of course his having asked of her to marry him this was mr verver s indulgent criticism but he found charlotte equally touched by the ingenuous maggie in easy agreement with him over the question if the prince had asked something of his wife every day in the year this would be still no reason why the poor dear man should not in a beautiful fit of homesickness revisit without reproach his native country what his father in law frankly counselled was that the reasonable the really too reasonable pair should while they were about it take three or four weeks of paris as well paris being always for mr verver in any stress of sympathy a suggestion that rose of itself to the lips if they would only do that on their way back or however they preferred it charlotte and he would go over to join them there for a small look though even then assuredly as he had it at heart to add not in the least because they should have found themselves bored at being left together the fate of this last proposal indeed was that it reeled for the moment under an assault of destructive analysis from maggie who having as she granted to choose between being an unnatural daughter or an unnatural mother and electing for the former wanted to know what would become of the principino if the house were cleared of everyone but the servants her question had fairly resounded but it had afterwards like many of her questions dropped still more effectively than it had risen the highest moral of the matter being before the couple took their departure that mrs noble and dr brady must mount unchallenged guard over the august little crib if she hadn t supremely believed in the majestic value of the nurse whose experience was in itself the amplest of pillows just as her attention was a spreading canopy from which precedent and reminiscence dropped as thickly as parted curtains if she hadn t been able to rest in this confidence she would fairly have sent her husband on his journey without her in the same manner if the sweetest for it was so she qualified him of little country doctors hadn t proved to her his wisdom by rendering irresistible especially on rainy days and in direct proportion to the frequency of his calls adapted to all weathers that she should converse with him for hours over causes and consequences over what he had found to answer with his little five at home she would have drawn scant support from the presence of a mere grandfather and a mere brilliant friend these persons accordingly her own predominance having thus for the time given way could carry with a certain ease and above all with mutual aid their consciousness of a charge so far as their office weighed they could help each other with it which was in fact to become as mrs noble herself loomed larger for them not a little of a relief and a diversion mr verver met his young friend at certain hours in the day nursery very much as he had regularly met the child s fond mother charlotte having as she clearly considered given maggie equal pledges and desiring never to fail of the last word for the daily letter she had promised to write she wrote with high fidelity she let her companion know and the effect of it was remarkably enough that he himself didn t write the reason of this was partly that charlotte told all about him which she also let him know she did and partly that he enjoyed feeling as a consequence that he was generally quite systematically eased and as they said done for committed as it were to this charming and clever young woman who by becoming for him a domestic resource had become for him practically a new person and committed especially in his own house which somehow made his sense of it a deeper thing he took an interest in seeing how far the connection could carry him could perhaps even lead him and in thus putting to the test for pleasant verification what fanny assingham had said at the last about the difference such a girl could make she was really making one now in their simplified existence and a very considerable one though there was no one to compare her with as there had been so usefully for fanny no mrs rance no kitty no dotty lutch to help her to be felt according to fanny s diagnosis as real she was real decidedly from other causes and mr verver grew in time even a little amused at the amount of machinery mrs assingham had seemed to see needed for pointing it she was directly and immediately real real on a pleasantly reduced and intimate scale and at no moments more so than during those at which we have just glanced when mrs noble made them both together feel that she she alone in the absence of the queen mother was regent of the realm and governess of the heir treated on such occasions as at best a pair of dangling and merely nominal court functionaries picturesque hereditary triflers entitled to the petites entrees but quite external to the state which began and ended with the nursery they could only retire in quickened sociability to what was left them of the palace there to digest their gilded insignificance and cultivate in regard to the true executive such snuff taking ironies as might belong to rococo chamberlains moving among china lap dogs every evening after dinner charlotte stant played to him seated at the piano and requiring no music she went through his favourite things and he had many favourites with a facility that never failed or that failed but just enough to pick itself up at a touch from his fitful voice she could play anything she could play everything always shockingly she of course insisted but always by his own vague measure very much as if she might slim sinuous and strong and with practised passion have been playing lawn tennis or endlessly and rhythmically waltzing his love of music unlike his other loves owned to vaguenesses but while on his comparatively shaded sofa and smoking smoking always smoking in the great fawns drawing room as everywhere the cigars of his youth rank with associations while i say he so listened to charlotte s piano where the score was ever absent but between the lighted candles the picture distinct the vagueness spread itself about him like some boundless carpet a surface delightfully soft to the pressure of his interest it was a manner of passing the time that rather replaced conversation but the air at the end none the less before they separated had a way of seeming full of the echoes of talk they separated in the hushed house not quite easily yet not quite awkwardly either with tapers that twinkled in the large dark spaces and for the most part so late that the last solemn servant had been dismissed for the night late as it was on a particular evening toward the end of october there had been a full word or two dropped into the still stirring sea of other voices a word or two that affected our friend even at the moment and rather oddly as louder and rounder than any previous sound and then he had lingered under pretext of an opened window to be made secure after taking leave of his companion in the hall and watching her glimmer away up the staircase he had for himself another impulse than to go to bed picking up a hat in the hall slipping his arms into a sleeveless cape and lighting still another cigar he turned out upon the terrace through one of the long drawing room windows and moved to and fro there for an hour beneath the sharp autumn stars it was where he had walked in the afternoon sun with fanny assingham and the sense of that other hour the sense of the suggestive woman herself was before him again as in spite of all the previous degustation we have hinted at it had not yet been he thought in a loose an almost agitated order of many things the power that was in them to agitate having been part of his conviction that he should not soon sleep he truly felt for a while that he should never sleep again till something had come to him some light some idea some mere happy word perhaps that he had begun to want but had been till now and especially the last day or two vainly groping for can you really then come if we start early that was practically all he had said to the girl as she took up her bedroom light and why in the world not when i ve nothing else to do and should besides so immensely like it this had as definitely been on her side the limit of the little scene there had in fact been nothing to call a scene even of the littlest at all though he perhaps didn t quite know why something like the menace of one hadn t proceeded from her stopping half way upstairs to turn and say as she looked down on him that she promised to content herself for their journey with a toothbrush and a sponge there hovered about him at all events while he walked appearances already familiar as well as two or three that were new and not the least vivid of the former connected itself with that sense of being treated with consideration which had become for him as we have noted one of the minor yet so far as there were any such quite one of the compensatory incidents of being a father in law it had struck him up to now that this particular balm was a mixture of which amerigo as through some hereditary privilege alone possessed the secret so that he found himself wondering if it had come to charlotte who had unmistakably acquired it through the young man s having amiably passed it on she made use for her so quietly grateful host however this might be of quite the same shades of attention and recognition was mistress in an equal degree of the regulated the developed art of placing him high in the scale of importance that was even for his own thought a clumsy way of expressing the element of similarity in the agreeable effect they each produced on him and it held him for a little only because this coincidence in their felicity caused him vaguely to connect or associate them in the matter of tradition training tact or whatever else one might call it it might almost have been if such a link between them was to be imagined that amerigo had a little coached or incited their young friend or perhaps rather that she had simply as one of the signs of the general perfection fanny assingham commended in her profited by observing during her short opportunity before the start of the travellers the pleasant application by the prince of his personal system he might wonder what exactly it was that they so resembled each other in treating him like from what noble and propagated convention in cases in which the exquisite importance was to be neither too grossly attributed nor too grossly denied they had taken their specific lesson but the difficulty was here of course that one could really never know couldn t know without having been one s self a personage whether a pope a king a president a peer a general or just a beautiful author before such a question as before several others when they recurred he would come to a pause leaning his arms on the old parapet and losing himself in a far excursion he had as to so many of the matters in hand a divided view and this was exactly what made him reach out in his unrest for some idea lurking in the vast freshness of the night at the breath of which disparities would submit to fusion and so spreading beneath him make him feel that he floated what he kept finding himself return to disturbingly enough was the reflection deeper than anything else that in forming a new and intimate tie he should in a manner abandon or at the best signally relegate his daughter he should reduce to definite form the idea that he had lost her as was indeed inevitable by her own marriage he should reduce to definite form the idea of his having incurred an injury or at the best an inconvenience that required some makeweight and deserved some amends and he should do this the more which was the great point that he should appear to adopt in doing it the sentiment in fact the very conviction entertained and quite sufficiently expressed by maggie herself in her beautiful generosity as to what he had suffered putting it with extravagance at her hands if she put it with extravagance the extravagance was yet sincere for it came which she put with extravagance too from her persistence always in thinking feeling talking about him as young he had had glimpses of moments when to hear her thus in her absolutely unforced compunction one would have supposed the special edge of the wrong she had done him to consist in his having still before him years and years to groan under it she had sacrificed a parent the pearl of parents no older than herself it wouldn t so much have mattered if he had been of common parental age that he wasn t that he was just her extraordinary equal and contemporary this was what added to her act the long train of its effect light broke for him at last indeed quite as a consequence of the fear of breathing a chill upon this luxuriance of her spiritual garden as at a turn of his labyrinth he saw his issue which opened out so wide for the minute that he held his breath with wonder he was afterwards to recall how just then the autumn night seemed to clear to a view in which the whole place everything round him the wide terrace where he stood the others with their steps below the gardens the park the lake the circling woods lay there as under some strange midnight sun it all met him during these instants as a vast expanse of discovery a world that looked so lighted extraordinarily new and in which familiar objects had taken on a distinctness that as if it had been a loud a spoken pretension to beauty interest importance to he scarce knew what gave them an inordinate quantity of character and verily an inordinate size this hallucination or whatever he might have called it was brief but it lasted long enough to leave him gasping the gasp of admiration had by this time however lost itself in an intensity that quickly followed the way the wonder of it since wonder was in question truly had been the strange delay of his vision he had these several days groped and groped for an object that lay at his feet and as to which his blindness came from his stupidly looking beyond it had sat all the while at his hearth stone whence it now gazed up in his face once he had recognised it there everything became coherent the sharp point to which all his light converged was that the whole call of his future to him as a father would be in his so managing that maggie would less and less appear to herself to have forsaken him and it not only wouldn t be decently humane decently possible not to make this relief easy to her the idea shone upon him more than that as exciting inspiring uplifting it fell in so beautifully with what might be otherwise possible it stood there absolutely confronted with the material way in which it might be met the way in which it might be met was by his putting his child at peace and the way to put her at peace was to provide for his future that is for hers by marriage by a marriage as good speaking proportionately as hers had been as he fairly inhaled this measure of refreshment he tasted the meaning of recent agitations he had seen that charlotte could contribute what he hadn t seen was what she could contribute to when it had all supremely cleared up and he had simply settled this service to his daughter well before him as the proper direction of his young friend s leisure the cool darkness had again closed round him but his moral lucidity was constituted it wasn t only moreover that the word with a click so fitted the riddle but that the riddle in such perfection fitted the word he might have been equally in want and yet not have had his remedy oh if charlotte didn t accept him of course the remedy would fail but as everything had fallen together it was at least there to be tried and success would be great that was his last throb if the measure of relief effected for maggie should at all prove to have been given by his own actual sense of felicity he really didn t know when in his life he had thought of anything happier to think of it merely for himself would have been even as he had just lately felt even doing all justice to that condition yes impossible but there was a grand difference in thinking of it for his child xii it was at brighton above all that this difference came out it was during the three wonderful days he spent there with charlotte that he had acquainted himself further though doubtless not even now quite completely with the merits of his majestic scheme and while moreover to begin with he still but held his vision in place steadying it fairly with his hands as he had often steadied for inspection a precarious old pot or kept a glazed picture in its right relation to the light the other the outer presumptions in his favour those independent of what he might himself contribute and that therefore till he should speak remained necessarily vague that quantity i say struck him as positively multiplying as putting on in the fresh brighton air and on the sunny brighton front a kind of tempting palpability he liked in this preliminary stage to feel that he should be able to speak and that he would the word itself being romantic pressing for him the spring of association with stories and plays where handsome and ardent young men in uniforms tights cloaks high boots had it in soliloquies ever on their lips and the sense on the first day that he should probably have taken the great step before the second was over conduced already to make him say to his companion that they must spend more than their mere night or two at his ease on the ground of what was before him he at all events definitely desired to be and it was strongly his impression that he was proceeding step by step he was acting it kept coming back to that not in the dark but in the high golden morning not in precipitation flurry fever dangers these of the path of passion properly so called but with the deliberation of a plan a plan that might be a thing of less joy than a passion but that probably would in compensation for that loss be found to have the essential property to wear even the decent dignity of reaching further and of providing for more contingencies the season was in local parlance on the elements were assembled the big windy hotel the draughty social hall swarmed with types in charlotte s constant phrase and resounded with a din in which the wild music of gilded and befrogged bands croatian dalmatian carpathian violently exotic and nostalgic was distinguished as struggling against the perpetual popping of corks much of this would decidedly have disconcerted our friends if it hadn t all happened more preponderantly to give them the brighter surprise the noble privacy of fawns had left them had left mr verver at least with a little accumulated sum of tolerance to spend on the high pitch and high colour of the public sphere fawns as it had been for him and as maggie and fanny assingham had both attested was out of the world whereas the scene actually about him with the very sea a mere big booming medium for excursions and aquariums affected him as so plump in the conscious centre that nothing could have been more complete for representing that pulse of life which they had come to unanimity at home on the subject of their advisedly not hereafter forgetting the pulse of life was what charlotte in her way at home had lately reproduced and there were positively current hours when it might have been open to her companion to feel himself again indebted to her for introductions he had brought her to put it crudely but it was almost as if she were herself in her greater gaiety her livelier curiosity and intensity her readier happier irony taking him about and showing him the place no one really when he came to think had ever taken him about before it had always been he of old who took others and who in particular took maggie this quickly fell into its relation with him as part of an experience marking for him no doubt what people call considerately a time of life a new and pleasant order a flattered passive state that might become why shouldn t it one of the comforts of the future mr gutermann seuss proved on the second day our friend had waited till then a remarkably genial a positively lustrous young man occupying a small neat house in a quarter of the place remote from the front and living as immediate and striking signs testified in the bosom of his family our visitors found themselves introduced by the operation of close contiguity to a numerous group of ladies and gentlemen older and younger and of children larger and smaller who mostly affected them as scarce less anointed for hospitality and who produced at first the impression of a birthday party of some anniversary gregariously and religiously kept though they subsequently fell into their places as members of one quiet domestic circle preponderantly and directly indebted for their being in fact to mr gutermann seuss to the casual eye a mere smart and shining youth of less than thirty summers faultlessly appointed in every particular he yet stood among his progeny eleven in all as he confessed without a sigh eleven little brown clear faces yet with such impersonal old eyes astride of such impersonal old noses while he entertained the great american collector whom he had so long hoped he might meet and whose charming companion the handsome frank familiar young lady presumably mrs verver noticed the graduated offspring noticed the fat ear ringed aunts and the glossy cockneyfied familiar uncles inimitable of accent and assumption and of an attitude of cruder intention than that of the head of the firm noticed the place in short noticed the treasure produced noticed everything as from the habit of a person finding her account at any time according to a wisdom well learned of life in almost any funny impression it really came home to her friend on the spot that this free range of observation in her picking out the frequent funny with extraordinary promptness would verily henceforth make a different thing for him of such experiences of the customary hunt for the possible prize the inquisitive play of his accepted monomania which different thing could probably be a lighter and perhaps thereby a somewhat more boisterously refreshing form of sport such omens struck him as vivid in any case when mr gutermann seuss with a sharpness of discrimination he had at first scarce seemed to promise invited his eminent couple into another room before the threshold of which the rest of the tribe unanimously faltering dropped out of the scene the treasure itself here the objects on behalf of which mr verver s interest had been booked established quickly enough their claim to engage the latter s attention yet at what point of his past did our friend s memory looking back and back catch him in any such place thinking so much less of wares artfully paraded than of some other and quite irrelevant presence such places were not strange to him when they took the form of bourgeois back parlours a trifle ominously grey and grim from their north light at watering places prevailingly homes of humbug or even when they wore some aspect still less if not perhaps still more insidious he had been everywhere pried and prowled everywhere going on occasion so far as to risk he believed life health and the very bloom of honour but where while precious things extracted one by one from thrice locked yet often vulgar drawers and soft satchels of old oriental ilk were impressively ranged before him had he till now let himself in consciousness wander like one of the vague he didn t betray it ah that he knew but two recognitions took place for him at once and one of them suffered a little in sweetness by the confusion mr gutermann seuss had truly for the crisis the putting down of his cards a rare manner he was perfect master of what not to say to such a personage as mr verver while the particular importance that dispenses with chatter was diffused by his movements themselves his repeated act of passage between a featureless mahogany meuble and a table so virtuously disinterested as to look fairly smug under a cotton cloth of faded maroon and indigo all redolent of patriarchal teas the damascene tiles successively and oh so tenderly unmuffled and revealed lay there at last in their full harmony and their venerable splendour but the tribute of appreciation and decision was while the spectator considered simplified to a point that but just failed of representing levity on the part of a man who had always acknowledged without shame in such affairs the intrinsic charm of what was called discussion the infinitely ancient the immemorial amethystine blue of the glaze scarcely more meant to be breathed upon it would seem than the cheek of royalty this property of the ordered and matched array had inevitably all its determination for him but his submission was perhaps for the first time in his life of the quick mind alone the process really itself in its way as fine as the perfection perceived and admired every inch of the rest of him being given to the foreknowledge that an hour or two later he should have spoken the burning of his ships therefore waited too near to let him handle his opportunity with his usual firm and sentient fingers waited somehow in the predominance of charlotte s very person in her being there exactly as she was capable as mr gutermann seuss himself was capable of the right felicity of silence but with an embracing ease through it all that made deferred criticism as fragrant as some joy promised a lover by his mistress or as a big bridal bouquet held patiently behind her he couldn t otherwise have explained surely why he found himself thinking to his enjoyment of so many other matters than the felicity of his acquisition and the figure of his cheque quite equally high any more than why later on with their return to the room in which they had been received and the renewed encompassment of the tribe he felt quite merged in the elated circle formed by the girl s free response to the collective caress of all the shining eyes and by her genial acceptance of the heavy cake and port wine that as she was afterwards to note added to their transaction for a finish the touch of some mystic rite of old jewry this characterisation came from her as they walked away walked together in the waning afternoon back to the breezy sea and the bustling front back to the nimble and the flutter and the shining shops that sharpened the grin of solicitation on the mask of night they were walking thus as he felt nearer and nearer to where he should see his ships burn and it was meanwhile for him quite as if this red glow would impart at the harmonious hour a lurid grandeur to his good faith it was meanwhile too a sign of the kind of sensibility often playing up in him that fabulous as this truth may sound he found a sentimental link an obligation of delicacy or perhaps even one of the penalties of its opposite in his having exposed her to the north light the quite properly hard business light of the room in which they had been alone with the treasure and its master she had listened to the name of the sum he was capable of looking in the face given the relation of intimacy with him she had already beyond all retractation accepted the stir of the air produced at the other place by that high figure struck him as a thing that from the moment she had exclaimed or protested as little as he himself had apologised left him but one thing more to do a man of decent feeling didn t thrust his money a huge lump of it in such a way under a poor girl s nose a girl whose poverty was after a fashion the very basis of her enjoyment of his hospitality without seeing logically a responsibility attached and this was to remain none the less true for the fact that twenty minutes later after he had applied his torch applied it with a sign or two of insistence what might definitely result failed to be immediately clear he had spoken spoken as they sat together on the out of the way bench observed during one of their walks and kept for the previous quarter of the present hour well in his memory s eye the particular spot to which between intense pauses and intenser advances he had all the while consistently led her below the great consolidated cliff well on to where the city of stucco sat most architecturally perched with the rumbling beach and the rising tide and the freshening stars in front and above the safe sense of the whole place yet prevailed in lamps and seats and flagged walks hovering also overhead in the close neighbourhood of a great replete community about to assist anew at the removal of dish covers we ve had as it seems to me such quite beautiful days together that i hope it won t come to you too much as a shock when i ask if you think you could regard me with any satisfaction as a husband as if he had known she wouldn t she of course couldn t at all gracefully and whether or no reply with a rush he had said a little more quite as he had felt he must in thinking it out in advance he had put the question on which there was no going back and which represented thereby the sacrifice of his vessels and what he further said was to stand for the redoubled thrust of flame that would make combustion sure this isn t sudden to me and i ve wondered at moments if you haven t felt me coming to it i ve been coming ever since we left fawns i really started while we were there he spoke slowly giving her as he desired time to think all the more that it was making her look at him steadily and making her also in a remarkable degree look well while she did so a large and so far a happy consequence she wasn t at all events shocked which he had glanced at but for a handsome humility and he would give her as many minutes as she liked you mustn t think i m forgetting that i m not young oh that isn t so it s i that am old you are young this was what she had at first answered and quite in the tone too of having taken her minutes it had not been wholly to the point but it had been kind which was what he most wanted and she kept for her next words to kindness kept to her clear lowered voice and unshrinking face to me too it thoroughly seems that these days have been beautiful i shouldn t be grateful to them if i couldn t more or less have imagined their bringing us to this she affected him somehow as if she had advanced a step to meet him and yet were at the same time standing still it only meant however doubtless that she was gravely and reasonably thinking as he exactly desired to make her if she would but think enough she would probably think to suit him it seems to me she went on that it s for you to be sure ah but i am sure said adam verver on matters of importance i never speak when i m not so if you can yourself face such a union you needn t in the least trouble she had another pause and she might have been felt as facing it while through lamplight and dusk through the breath of the mild slightly damp southwest she met his eyes without evasion yet she had at the end of another minute debated only to the extent of saying i won t pretend i don t think it would be good for me to marry good for me i mean she pursued because i m so awfully unattached i should like to be a little less adrift i should like to have a home i should like to have an existence i should like to have a motive for one thing more than another a motive outside of myself in fact she said so sincerely that it almost showed pain yet so lucidly that it almost showed humour in fact you know i want to be married it s well it s the condition the condition he was just vague it s the state i mean i don t like my own miss among us all is too dreadful except for a shopgirl i don t want to be a horrible english old maid oh you want to be taken care of very well then i ll do it i dare say it s very much that only i don t see why for what i speak of she smiled for a mere escape from my state i need do quite so much so much as marry me in particular her smile was as for true directness i might get what i want for less you think it so much for you to do yes she presently said i think it s a great deal then it was that though she was so gentle so quite perfect with him and he felt he had come on far then it was that of a sudden something seemed to fail and he didn t quite know where they were there rose for him with this the fact to be sure of their disparity deny it as mercifully and perversely as she would he might have been her father of course yes that s my disadvantage i m not the natural i m so far from being the ideal match to your youth and your beauty i ve the drawback that you ve seen me always so inevitably in such another light but she gave a slow headshake that made contradiction soft made it almost sad in fact as from having to be so complete and he had already before she spoke the dim vision of some objection in her mind beside which the one he had named was light and which therefore must be strangely deep you don t understand me it s of all that it is for you to do it s of that i m thinking oh with this for him the thing was clearer then you needn t think i know enough what it is for me to do but she shook her head again i doubt if you know i doubt if you can and why not please when i ve had you so before me that i m old has at least that fact about it to the good that i ve known you long and from far back do you think you ve known me asked charlotte stant he hesitated for the tone of it and her look with it might have made him doubt just these things in themselves however with all the rest with his fixed purpose now his committed deed the fine pink glow projected forward of his ships behind him definitely blazing and crackling this quantity was to push him harder than any word of her own could warn him all that she was herself moreover was so lighted to its advantage by the pink glow he wasn t rabid but he wasn t either as a man of a proper spirit to be frightened what is that then if i accept it but as strong a reason as i can want for just learning to know you she faced him always kept it up as for honesty and yet at the same time in her odd way as for mercy how can you tell whether if you did you would it was ambiguous for an instant as she showed she felt i mean when it s a question of learning one learns sometimes too late i think it s a question he promptly enough made answer of liking you the more just for your saying these things you should make something he added of my liking you i make everything but are you sure of having exhausted all other ways this of a truth enlarged his gaze but what other ways why you ve more ways of being kind than anyone i ever knew take it then he answered that i m simply putting them all together for you she looked at him on this long again still as if it shouldn t be said she hadn t given him time or had withdrawn from his view so to speak a single inch of her surface this at least she was fully to have exposed it represented her as oddly conscientious and he scarce knew in what sense it affected him on the whole however with admiration you re very very honourable it s just what i want to be i don t see she added why you re not right i don t see why you re not happy as you are i can not ask myself i can not ask you she went on if you re really as much at liberty as your universal generosity leads you to assume oughtn t we she asked to think a little of others oughtn t i at least in loyalty at any rate in delicacy to think of maggie with which intensely gentle so as not to appear too much to teach him his duty she explained she s everything to you she has always been are you so certain that there s room in your life for another daughter is that what you mean she had not hung upon it long but he had quickly taken her up he had not however disconcerted her for another young woman very much of her age and whose relation to her has always been so different from what our marrying would make it for another companion said charlotte stant can t a man be all his life then he almost fiercely asked anything but a father but he went on before she could answer you talk about differences but they ve been already made as no one knows better than maggie she feels the one she made herself by her own marriage made i mean for me she constantly thinks of it it allows her no rest to put her at peace is therefore he explained what i m trying with you to do i can t do it alone but i can do it with your help you can make her he said positively happy about me about you she thoughtfully echoed but what can i make her about herself oh if she s at ease about me the rest will take care of itself the case he declared is in your hands you ll effectually put out of her mind that i feel she has abandoned me interest certainly now was what he had kindled in her face but it was all the more honourable to her as he had just called it that she should want to see each of the steps of his conviction if you ve been driven to the likes of me mayn t it show that you ve felt truly forsaken well i m willing to suggest that if i can show at the same time that i feel consoled but have you she demanded really felt so he hesitated consoled forsaken no i haven t but if it s her idea if it was her idea in short that was enough this enunciation of motive the next moment however sounded to him perhaps slightly thin so that he gave it another touch that is if it s my idea i happen you see to like my idea well it s beautiful and wonderful but isn t it possibly charlotte asked not quite enough to marry me for why so my dear child isn t a man s idea usually what he does marry for charlotte considering looked as if this might perhaps be a large question or at all events something of an extension of one they were immediately concerned with doesn t that a good deal depend on the sort of thing it may be she suggested that about marriage ideas as he called them might differ with which however giving no more time to it she sounded another question don t you appear rather to put it to me that i may accept your offer for maggie s sake somehow she turned it over i don t so clearly see her quite so much finding reassurance or even quite so much needing it do you then make nothing at all of her having been so ready to leave us ah charlotte on the contrary made much she was ready to leave us because she had to be from the moment the prince wanted it she could only go with him perfectly so that if you see your way she will be able to go with him in future as much as she likes charlotte appeared to examine for a minute in maggie s interest this privilege the result of which was a limited concession you ve certainly worked it out of course i ve worked it out that s exactly what i have done she hadn t for a long time been so happy about anything as at your being there with me i was to be with you said charlotte for her security well adam verver rang out this is her security you ve only if you can t see it to ask her ask her the girl echoed it in wonder certainly in so many words telling her you don t believe me still she debated do you mean write it to her quite so immediately to morrow oh i don t think i can write it said charlotte stant when i write to her and she looked amused for so different a shade it s about the principino s appetite and dr brady s visits very good then put it to her face to face we ll go straight to paris to meet them charlotte at this rose with a movement that was like a small cry but her unspoken sense lost itself while she stood with her eyes on him he keeping his seat as for the help it gave him a little to make his appeal go up presently however a new sense had come to her and she covered him kindly with the expression of it i do think you know you must rather like me thank you said adam verver you will put it to her yourself then she had another hesitation we go over you say to meet them as soon as we can get back to fawns and wait there for them if necessary till they come wait a at fawns wait in paris that will be charming in itself you take me to pleasant places she turned it over you propose to me beautiful things it rests but with you to make them beautiful and pleasant you ve made brighton ah she almost tenderly protested with what i m doing now you re promising me now what i want aren t you promising me he pressed getting up aren t you promising me to abide by what maggie says oh she wanted to be sure she was do you mean she ll ask it of me it gave him indeed as by communication a sense of the propriety of being himself certain yet what was he but certain she ll speak to you she ll speak to you for me this at last then seemed to satisfy her very good may we wait again to talk of it till she has done so he showed with his hands down in his pockets and his shoulders expressively up a certain disappointment soon enough none the less his gentleness was all back and his patience once more exemplary of course i give you time especially he smiled as it s time that i shall be spending with you our keeping on together will help you perhaps to see to see i mean how i need you i already see said charlotte how you ve persuaded yourself you do but she had to repeat it that isn t unfortunately all well then how you ll make maggie right right she echoed it as if the word went far and o oh she still critically murmured as they moved together away xiii he had talked to her of their waiting in paris a week later but on the spot there this period of patience suffered no great strain he had written to his daughter not indeed from brighton but directly after their return to fawns where they spent only forty eight hours before resuming their journey and maggie s reply to his news was a telegram from rome delivered to him at noon of their fourth day and which he brought out to charlotte who was seated at that moment in the court of the hotel where they had agreed that he should join her for their proceeding together to the noontide meal his letter at fawns a letter of several pages and intended lucidly unreservedly in fact all but triumphantly to inform had proved on his sitting down to it and a little to his surprise not quite so simple a document to frame as even his due consciousness of its weight of meaning had allowed him to assume this doubtless however only for reasons naturally latent in the very wealth of that consciousness which contributed to his message something of their own quality of impatience the main result of their talk for the time had been a difference in his relation to his young friend as well as a difference equally sensible in her relation to himself and this in spite of his not having again renewed his undertaking to speak to her so far even as to tell her of the communication despatched to rome delicacy a delicacy more beautiful still all the delicacy she should want reigned between them it being rudimentary in their actual order that she mustn t be further worried until maggie should have put her at her ease it was just the delicacy however that in paris which suggestively was brighton at a hundredfold higher pitch made between him and his companion the tension made the suspense made what he would have consented perhaps to call the provisional peculiarity of present conditions these elements acted in a manner of their own imposing and involving under one head many abstentions and precautions twenty anxieties and reminders things verily he would scarce have known how to express and yet creating for them at every step an acceptance of their reality he was hanging back with charlotte till another person should intervene for their assistance and yet they had by what had already occurred been carried on to something it was out of the power of other persons to make either less or greater common conventions that was what was odd had to be on this basis more thought of those common conventions that previous to the passage by the brighton strand he had so enjoyed the sense of their overlooking the explanation would have been he supposed or would have figured it with less of unrest that paris had in its way deeper voices and warnings so that if you went at all far there it laid bristling traps as they might have been viewed all smothered in flowers for your going further still there were strange appearances in the air and before you knew it you might be unmistakably matching them since he wished therefore to match no appearance but that of a gentleman playing with perfect fairness any game in life he might be called to he found himself on the receipt of maggie s missive rejoicing with a certain inconsistency the announcement made her from home had in the act cost some biting of his pen to sundry parts of him his personal modesty his imagination of her prepared state for so quick a jump it didn t much matter which and yet he was more eager than not for the drop of delay and for the quicker transitions promised by the arrival of the imminent pair there was after all a hint of offence to a man of his age in being taken as they said at the shops on approval maggie certainly would have been as far as charlotte herself from positively desiring this and charlotte on her side as far as maggie from holding him light as a real value she made him fidget thus poor girl but from generous rigour of conscience these allowances of his spirit were all the same consistent with a great gladness at the sight of the term of his ordeal for it was the end of his seeming to agree that questions and doubts had a place the more he had inwardly turned the matter over the more it had struck him that they had in truth only an ugliness what he could have best borne as he now believed would have been charlotte s simply saying to him that she didn t like him enough this he wouldn t have enjoyed but he would quite have understood it and been able ruefully to submit she did like him enough nothing to contradict that had come out for him so that he was restless for her as well as for himself she looked at him hard a moment when he handed her his telegram and the look for what he fancied a dim shy fear in it gave him perhaps his best moment of conviction that as a man so to speak he properly pleased her he said nothing the words sufficiently did it for him doing it again better still as charlotte who had left her chair at his approach murmured them out we start to night to bring you all our love and joy and sympathy there they were the words and what did she want more she didn t however as she gave him back the little unfolded leaf say they were enough though he saw the next moment that her silence was probably not disconnected from her having just visibly turned pale her extraordinarily fine eyes as it was his present theory that he had always thought them shone at him the more darkly out of this change of colour and she had again with it her apparent way of subjecting herself for explicit honesty and through her willingness to face him to any view he might take all at his ease and even to wantonness of the condition he produced in her as soon as he perceived that emotion kept her soundless he knew himself deeply touched since it proved that little as she professed she had been beautifully hoping they stood there a minute while he took in from this sign that yes then certainly she liked him enough liked him enough to make him old as he was ready to brand himself flush for the pleasure of it the pleasure of it accordingly made him speak first do you begin a little to be satisfied still however she had to think we ve hurried them you see why so breathless a start because they want to congratulate us they want said adam verver to see our happiness she wondered again and this time also for him as publicly as possible so much as that do you think it s too much she continued to think plainly they weren t to have started for another week well what then isn t our situation worth the little sacrifice we ll go back to rome as soon as you like with them this seemed to hold her as he had previously seen her held just a trifle inscrutably by his allusions to what they would do together on a certain contingency worth it the little sacrifice for whom for us naturally yes she said we want to see them for our reasons that is she rather dimly smiled you do and you do my dear too he bravely declared yes then i do too she after an instant ungrudging enough acknowledged for us however something depends on it rather but does nothing depend on it for them what can from the moment that as appears they don t want to nip us in the bud i can imagine their rushing up to prevent us but an enthusiasm for us that can wait so very little such intense eagerness i confess she went on more than a little puzzles me you may think me she also added ungracious and suspicious but the prince can t at all want to come back so soon he wanted quite too intensely to get away mr verver considered well hasn t he been away yes just long enough to see how he likes it besides said charlotte he may not be able to join in the rosy view of our case that you impute to her it can t in the least have appeared to him hitherto a matter of course that you should give his wife a bouncing stepmother adam verver at this looked grave i m afraid then he ll just have to accept from us whatever his wife accepts and accept it if he can imagine no better reason just because she does that he declared will have to do for him his tone made her for a moment meet his face after which let me she abruptly said see it again taking from him the folded leaf that she had given back and he had kept in his hand isn t the whole thing she asked when she had read it over perhaps but a way like another for their gaining time he again stood staring but the next minute with that upward spring of his shoulders and that downward pressure of his pockets which she had already more than once at disconcerted moments determined in him he turned sharply away and wandered from her in silence he looked about in his small despair he crossed the hotel court which overarched and glazed muffled against loud sounds and guarded against crude sights heated gilded draped almost carpeted with exotic trees in tubs exotic ladies in chairs the general exotic accent and presence suspended as with wings folded or feebly fluttering in the superior the supreme the inexorably enveloping parisian medium resembled some critical apartment of large capacity some dental medical surgical waiting room a scene of mixed anxiety and desire preparatory for gathered barbarians to the due amputation or extraction of excrescences and redundancies of barbarism he went as far as the porte cochere took counsel afresh of his usual optimism sharpened even somehow just here by the very air he tasted and then came back smiling to charlotte it is incredible to you that when a man is still as much in love as amerigo his most natural impulse should be to feel what his wife feels to believe what she believes to want what she wants in the absence that is of special impediments to his so doing the manner of it operated she acknowledged with no great delay this natural possibility no nothing is incredible to me of people immensely in love well isn t amerigo immensely in love she hesitated but as for the right expression of her sense of the degree but she after all adopted mr verver s immensely then there you are she had another smile however she wasn t there quite yet that isn t all that s wanted but what more why that his wife shall have made him really believe that she really believes with which charlotte became still more lucidly logical the reality of his belief will depend in such a case on the reality of hers the prince may for instance now she went on have made out to his satisfaction that maggie may mainly desire to abound in your sense whatever it is you do he may remember that he has never seen her do anything else well said adam verver what kind of a warning will he have found in that to what catastrophe will he have observed such a disposition in her to lead just to this one with which she struck him as rising straighter and clearer before him than she had done even yet our little question itself her appearance had in fact at the moment such an effect on him that he could answer but in marvelling mildness hadn t we better wait a while till we call it a catastrophe her rejoinder to this was to wait though by no means as long as he meant when at the end of her minute she spoke however it was mildly too what would you like dear friend to wait for it lingered between them in the air this demand and they exchanged for the time a look which might have made each of them seem to have been watching in the other the signs of its overt irony these were indeed immediately so visible in mr verver s face that as if a little ashamed of having so markedly produced them and as if also to bring out at last under pressure something she had all the while been keeping back she took a jump to pure plain reason you haven t noticed for yourself but i can t quite help noticing that in spite of what you assume we assume if you like maggie wires her joy only to you she makes no sign of its overflow to me it was a point and staring a moment he took account of it but he had as before his presence of mind to say nothing of his kindly humour why you complain of the very thing that s most charmingly conclusive she treats us already as one clearly now for the girl in spite of lucidity and logic there was something in the way he said things she faced him in all her desire to please him and then her word quite simply and definitely showed it i do like you you know well what could this do but stimulate his humour i see what s the matter with you you won t be quiet till you ve heard from the prince himself i think the happy man added that i ll go and secretly wire to him that you d like reply paid a few words for yourself it could apparently but encourage her further to smile reply paid for him you mean or for me oh i ll pay with pleasure anything back for you as many words as you like and he went on to keep it up not requiring either to see your message she could take it visibly as he meant it should you require to see the prince s not a bit you can keep that also to yourself on his speaking however as if his transmitting the hint were a real question she appeared to consider and almost as if for good taste that the joke had gone far enough it doesn t matter unless he speaks of his own movement and why should it be she asked a thing that would occur to him i really think mr verver concurred that it naturally wouldn t he doesn t know you re morbid she just wondered but she agreed no he hasn t yet found it out perhaps he will but he hasn t yet and i m willing to give him meanwhile the benefit of the doubt so with this the situation to her view would appear to have cleared had she not too quickly had one of her restless relapses maggie however does know i m morbid she hasn t the benefit well said adam verver a little wearily at last i think i feel that you ll hear from her yet it had even fairly come over him under recurrent suggestion that his daughter s omission was surprising and maggie had never in her life been wrong for more than three minutes oh it isn t that i hold that i ve a right to it charlotte the next instant rather oddly qualified and the observation itself gave him a further push very well i shall like it myself at this then as if moved by his way of constantly and more or less against his own contention coming round to her she showed how she could also always and not less gently come half way i speak of it only as the missing grace the grace that s in everything that maggie does it isn t my due she kept it up but taking from you that we may still expect it it will have the touch it will be beautiful then come out to breakfast mr verver had looked at his watch it will be here when we get back if it isn t and charlotte smiled as she looked about for a feather boa that she had laid down on descending from her room if it isn t it will have had but that slight fault he saw her boa on the arm of the chair from which she had moved to meet him and after he had fetched it raising it to make its charming softness brush his face for it was a wondrous product of paris purchased under his direct auspices the day before he held it there a minute before giving it up will you promise me then to be at peace she looked while she debated at his admirable present i promise you quite for ever quite for ever remember he went on to justify his demand remember that in wiring you she ll naturally speak even more for her husband than she has done in wiring me it was only at a word that charlotte had a demur naturally why our marriage puts him for you you see or puts you for him into a new relation whereas it leaves his relation to me unchanged it therefore gives him more to say to you about it about its making me his stepmother in law or whatever i should become over which for a little she not undivertedly mused yes there may easily be enough for a gentleman to say to a young woman about that well amerigo can always be according to the case either as funny or as serious as you like and whichever he may be for you in sending you a message he ll be it all and then as the girl with one of her so deeply and oddly yet so tenderly critical looks at him failed to take up the remark he found himself moved as by a vague anxiety to add a question don t you think he s charming oh charming said charlotte stant if he weren t i shouldn t mind no more should i her friend harmoniously returned ah but you don t mind you don t have to you don t have to i mean as i have it s the last folly ever to care in an anxious way the least particle more than one is absolutely forced if i were you she went on if i had in my life for happiness and power and peace even a small fraction of what you have it would take a great deal to make me waste my worry i don t know she said what in the world that didn t touch my luck i should trouble my head about i quite understand you yet doesn t it just depend mr verver asked on what you call one s luck it s exactly my luck that i m talking about i shall be as sublime as you like when you ve made me all right it s only when one is right that one really has the things you speak of it isn t they he explained that make one so it s the something else i want that makes them right if you ll give me what i ask you ll see she had taken her boa and thrown it over her shoulders and her eyes while she still delayed had turned from him engaged by another interest though the court was by this time the hour of dispersal for luncheon so forsaken that they would have had it for free talk should they have been moved to loudness quite to themselves she was ready for their adjournment but she was also aware of a pedestrian youth in uniform a visible emissary of the postes et telegraphes who had approached from the street the small stronghold of the concierge and who presented there a missive taken from the little cartridge box slung over his shoulder the portress meeting him on the threshold met equally across the court charlotte s marked attention to his visit so that within the minute she had advanced to our friends with her cap streamers flying and her smile of announcement as ample as her broad white apron she raised aloft a telegraphic message and as she delivered it sociably discriminated cette fois ci pour madame with which she as genially retreated leaving charlotte in possession charlotte taking it held it at first unopened her eyes had come back to her companion who had immediately and triumphantly greeted it ah there you are she broke the envelope then in silence and for a minute as with the message he himself had put before her studied its contents without a sign he watched her without a question and at last she looked up i ll give you she simply said what you ask the expression of her face was strange but since when had a woman s at moments of supreme surrender not a right to be he took it in with his own long look and his grateful silence so that nothing more for some instants passed between them their understanding sealed itself he already felt that she had made him right but he was in presence too of the fact that maggie had made her so and always therefore without maggie where in fine would he be she united them brought them together as with the click of a silver spring and on the spot with the vision of it his eyes filled charlotte facing him meanwhile with her expression made still stranger by the blur of his gratitude through it all however he smiled what my child does for me through it all as well that is still through the blur he saw charlotte rather than heard her reply she held her paper wide open but her eyes were all for his it isn t maggie it s the prince i say he gaily rang out then it s best of all it s enough thank you for thinking so to which he added it s enough for our question but it isn t is it quite enough for our breakfast dejeunons she stood there however in spite of this appeal her document always before them don t you want to read it he thought not if it satisfies you i don t require it but she gave him as for her conscience another chance you can if you like he hesitated afresh but as for amiability not for curiosity is it funny thus finally she again dropped her eyes on it drawing in her lips a little no i call it grave ah then i don t want it very grave said charlotte stant well what did i tell you of him he asked rejoicing as they started a question for all answer to which before she took his arm the girl thrust her paper crumpled into the pocket of her coat part third xiv charlotte half way up the monumental staircase had begun by waiting alone waiting to be rejoined by her companion who had gone down all the way as in common kindness bound and who his duty performed would know where to find her she was meanwhile though extremely apparent not perhaps absolutely advertised but she would not have cared if she had been so little was it by this time her first occasion of facing society with a consciousness materially with a confidence quite splendidly enriched for a couple of years now she had known as never before what it was to look well to look that is as well as she had always felt from far back that in certain conditions she might on such an evening as this that of a great official party in the full flush of the london spring time the conditions affected her her nerves her senses her imagination as all profusely present so that perhaps at no moment yet had she been so justified of her faith as at the particular instant of our being again concerned with her that of her chancing to glance higher up from where she stood and meeting in consequence the quiet eyes of colonel assingham who had his elbows on the broad balustrade of the great gallery overhanging the staircase and who immediately exchanged with her one of his most artlessly familiar signals this simplicity of his visual attention struck her even with the other things she had to think about as the quietest note in the whole high pitch much in fact as if she had pressed a finger on a chord or a key and created for the number of seconds an arrest of vibration a more muffled thump the sight of him suggested indeed that fanny would be there though so far as opportunity went she had not seen her this was about the limit of what it could suggest the air however had suggestions enough it abounded in them many of them precisely helping to constitute those conditions with which for our young woman the hour was brilliantly crowned she was herself in truth crowned and it all hung together melted together in light and colour and sound the unsurpassed diamonds that her head so happily carried the other jewels the other perfections of aspect and arrangement that made her personal scheme a success the proved private theory that materials to work with had been all she required and that there were none too precious for her to understand and use to which might be added lastly as the strong scented flower of the total sweetness an easy command a high enjoyment of her crisis for a crisis she was ready to take it and this ease it was doubtless that helped her while she waited to the right assurance to the right indifference to the right expression and above all as she felt to the right view of her opportunity for happiness unless indeed the opportunity itself rather were in its mere strange amplitude the producing the precipitating cause the ordered revellers rustling and shining with sweep of train and glitter of star and clink of sword and yet for all this but so imperfectly articulate so vaguely vocal the double stream of the coming and the going flowing together where she stood passed her brushed her treated her to much crude contemplation and now and then to a spasm of speech an offered hand even in some cases to an unencouraged pause but she missed no countenance and invited no protection she fairly liked to be so long as she might just as she was exposed a little to the public no doubt in her unaccompanied state but even if it were a bit brazen careless of queer reflections on the dull polish of london faces and exposed since it was a question of exposure to much more competent recognitions of her own she hoped no one would stop she was positively keeping herself it was her idea to mark in a particular manner the importance of something that had just happened she knew how she should mark it and what she was doing there made already a beginning when presently therefore from her standpoint she saw the prince come back she had an impression of all the place as higher and wider and more appointed for great moments with its dome of lustres lifted its ascents and descents more majestic its marble tiers more vividly overhung its numerosity of royalties foreign and domestic more unprecedented its symbolism of state hospitality both emphasised and refined this was doubtless a large consequence of a fairly familiar cause a considerable inward stir to spring from the mere vision striking as that might be of amerigo in a crowd but she had her reasons she held them there she carried them in fact responsibly and overtly as she carried her head her high tiara her folded fan her indifferent unattended eminence and it was when he reached her and she could taking his arm show herself as placed in her relation that she felt supremely justified it was her notion of course that she gave a glimpse of but few of her grounds for this discrimination indeed of the most evident alone yet she would have been half willing it should be guessed how she drew inspiration drew support in quantity sufficient for almost anything from the individual value that through all the picture her husband s son in law kept for the eye deriving it from his fine unconscious way in the swarming social sum of outshining overlooking and overtopping it was as if in separation even the shortest she half forgot or disbelieved how he affected her sight so that reappearance had in him each time a virtue of its own a kind of disproportionate intensity suggesting his connection with occult sources of renewal what did he do when he was away from her that made him always come back only looking as she would have called it more so superior to any shade of cabotinage he yet almost resembled an actor who between his moments on the stage revisits his dressing room and before the glass pressed by his need of effect retouches his make up the prince was at present for instance though he had quitted her but ten minutes before still more than then the person it pleased her to be left with a truth that had all its force for her while he made her his care for their conspicuous return together to the upper rooms conspicuous beyond any wish they could entertain was what poor wonderful man he couldn t help making it and when she raised her eyes again on the ascent to bob assingham still aloft in his gallery and still looking down at her she was aware that in spite of hovering and warning inward voices she even enjoyed the testimony rendered by his lonely vigil to the lustre she reflected he was always lonely at great parties the dear colonel it wasn t in such places that the seed he sowed at home was ever reaped by him but nobody could have seemed to mind it less to brave it with more bronzed indifference so markedly that he moved about less like one of the guests than like some quite presentable person in charge of the police arrangements or the electric light to mrs verver as will be seen he represented with the perfect good faith of his apparent blankness something definite enough though her bravery was not thereby too blighted for her to feel herself calling him to witness that the only witchcraft her companion had used within the few minutes was that of attending maggie who had withdrawn from the scene to her carriage notified at all events of fanny s probable presence charlotte was for a while after this divided between the sense of it as a fact somehow to reckon with and deal with which was a perception that made in its degree for the prudence the pusillanimity of postponement of avoidance and a quite other feeling an impatience that presently ended by prevailing an eagerness really to be suspected sounded veritably arraigned if only that she might have the bad moment over if only that she might prove to herself let alone to mrs assingham also that she could convert it to good if only in short to be square as they said with her question for herself indeed particularly it wasn t a question but something in her bones told her that fanny would treat it as one and there was truly nothing that from this friend she was not bound in decency to take she might hand things back with every tender precaution with acknowledgments and assurances but she owed it to them in any case and it to all mrs assingham had done for her not to get rid of them without having well unwrapped and turned them over to night as happened and she recognised it more and more with the ebbing minutes as an influence of everything about her to night exactly she would no doubt since she knew why be as firm as she might at any near moment again hope to be for going through that process with the right temper and tone she said after a little to the prince stay with me let no one take you for i want her yes i do want her to see us together and the sooner the better said it to keep her hand on him through constant diversions and made him in fact by saying it profess a momentary vagueness she had to explain to him that it was fanny assingham she wanted to see who clearly would be there since the colonel never either stirred without her or once arrived concerned himself for her fate and she had further after amerigo had met her with see us together why in the world hasn t she often seen us together to inform him that what had elsewhere and otherwise happened didn t now matter and that she at any rate well knew for the occasion what she was about you re strange cara mia he consentingly enough dropped but for whatever strangeness he kept her as they circulated from being waylaid even remarking to her afresh as he had often done before on the help rendered in such situations by the intrinsic oddity of the london squash a thing of vague slow senseless eddies revolving as in fear of some menace of conversation suspended over it the drop of which with some consequent refreshing splash or spatter yet never took place of course she was strange this as they went charlotte knew for herself how could she be anything else when the situation holding her and holding him for that matter just as much had so the stamp of it she had already accepted her consciousness as we have already noted that a crisis for them all was in the air and when such hours were not depressing which was the form indeed in which she had mainly known them they were apparently in a high degree exhilarating later on in a corner to which at sight of an empty sofa mrs assingham had after a single attentive arrest led her with a certain earnestness this vision of the critical was much more sharpened than blurred fanny had taken it from her yes she was there with amerigo alone maggie having come with them and then within ten minutes changed her mind repented and departed so you re staying on together without her the elder woman had asked and it was charlotte s answer to this that had determined for them quite indeed according to the latter s expectation the need of some seclusion and her companion s pounce at the sofa they were staying on together alone and oh distinctly it was alone that maggie had driven away her father as usual not having managed to come as usual mrs assingham had seemed to wonder mr verver s reluctances not having she in fact quite intimated hitherto struck her charlotte responded at any rate that his indisposition to go out had lately much increased even though to night as she admitted he had pleaded his not feeling well maggie had wished to stay with him for the prince and she dining out had afterwards called in portland place whence in the event they had brought her charlotte on maggie had come but to oblige her father she had urged the two others to go without her then she had yielded for the time to mr verver s persuasion but here when they had after the long wait in the carriage fairly got in here once up the stairs with the rooms before them remorse had ended by seizing her she had listened to no other remonstrance and at present therefore as charlotte put it the two were doubtless making together a little party at home but it was all right so charlotte also put it there was nothing in the world they liked better than these snatched felicities little parties long talks with i ll come to you to morrow and no i ll come to you make believe renewals of their old life they were fairly at times the dear things like children playing at paying visits playing at mr thompson and mrs fane each hoping that the other would really stay to tea charlotte was sure she should find maggie there on getting home a remark in which mrs verver s immediate response to her friend s inquiry had culminated she had thus on the spot the sense of having given her plenty to think about and that moreover of liking to see it even better than she had expected she had plenty to think about herself and there was already something in fanny that made it seem still more you say your husband s ill he felt too ill to come no my dear i think not if he had been too ill i wouldn t have left him and yet maggie was worried mrs assingham asked she worries you know easily she s afraid of influenza of which he has had at different times though never with the least gravity several attacks but you re not afraid of it charlotte had for a moment a pause it had continued to come to her that really to have her case out as they said with the person in the world to whom her most intimate difficulties had oftenest referred themselves would help her on the whole more than hinder and under that feeling all her opportunity with nothing kept back with a thing or two perhaps even thrust forward seemed temptingly to open besides didn t fanny at bottom half expect absolutely at the bottom half want things so that she would be disappointed if after what must just have occurred for her she didn t get something to put between the teeth of her so restless rumination that cultivation of the fear of which our young woman had already had glimpses that she might have gone too far in her irrepressible interest in other lives what had just happened it pieced itself together for charlotte was that the assingham pair drifting like everyone else had had somewhere in the gallery in the rooms an accidental concussion had it after the colonel over his balustrade had observed in the favouring high light her public junction with the prince his very dryness in this encounter had as always struck a spark from his wife s curiosity and familiar on his side with all that she saw in things he had thrown her as a fine little bone to pick some report of the way one of her young friends was going on with another he knew perfectly such at least was charlotte s liberal assumption that she wasn t going on with anyone but she also knew that given the circumstances she was inevitably to be sacrificed in some form or another to the humorous intercourse of the inimitable couple the prince meanwhile had also under coercion sacrificed her the ambassador had come up to him with a message from royalty to whom he was led away after which she had talked for five minutes with sir john brinder who had been of the ambassador s company and who had rather artlessly remained with her fanny had then arrived in sight of them at the same moment as someone else she didn t know someone who knew mrs assingham and also knew sir john charlotte had left it to her friend s competence to throw the two others immediately together and to find a way for entertaining her in closer quarters this was the little history of the vision in her that was now rapidly helping her to recognise a precious chance the chance that mightn t again soon be so good for the vivid making of a point her point was before her it was sharp bright true above all it was her own she had reached it quite by herself no one not even amerigo amerigo least of all who would have nothing to do with it had given her aid to make it now with force for fanny assingham s benefit would see her further in the direction in which the light had dawned than any other spring she should yet awhile doubtless be able to press the direction was that of her greater freedom which was all in the world she had in mind her opportunity had accordingly after a few minutes of mrs assingham s almost imprudently interested expression of face positively acquired such a price for her that she may for ourselves while the intensity lasted rather resemble a person holding out a small mirror at arm s length and consulting it with a special turn of the head it was in a word with this value of her chance that she was intelligently playing when she said in answer to fanny s last question don t you remember what you told me on the occasion of something or other the other day that you believe there s nothing i m afraid of so my dear don t ask me mayn t i ask you mrs assingham returned how the case stands with your poor husband certainly dear only when you ask me as if i mightn t perhaps know what to think it seems to me best to let you see that i know perfectly what to think mrs assingham hesitated then blinking a little she took her risk you didn t think that if it was a question of anyone s returning to him in his trouble it would be better you yourself should have gone well charlotte s answer to this inquiry visibly shaped itself in the interest of the highest considerations the highest considerations were good humour candour clearness and obviously the real truth if we couldn t be perfectly frank and dear with each other it would be ever so much better wouldn t it that we shouldn t talk about anything at all which however would be dreadful and we certainly at any rate haven t yet come to it you can ask me anything under the sun you like because don t you see you can t upset me i m sure my dear charlotte fanny assingham laughed i don t want to upset you indeed love you simply couldn t even if you thought it necessary that s all i mean nobody could for it belongs to my situation that i m by no merit of my own just fixed fixed as fast as a pin stuck up to its head in a cushion i m placed i can t imagine anyone more placed there i am fanny had indeed never listened to emphasis more firmly applied and it brought into her own eyes though she had reasons for striving to keep them from betrayals a sort of anxiety of intelligence i dare say but your statement of your position however you see it isn t an answer to my inquiry it seems to me at the same time i confess mrs assingham added to give but the more reason for it you speak of our being frank how can we possibly be anything else if maggie has gone off through finding herself too distressed to stay and if she s willing to leave you and her husband to show here without her aren t the grounds of her preoccupation more or less discussable if they re not charlotte replied it s only from their being in a way too evident they re not grounds for me they weren t when i accepted adam s preference that i should come to night without him just as i accept absolutely as a fixed rule all his preferences but that doesn t alter the fact of course that my husband s daughter rather than his wife should have felt she could after all be the one to stay with him the one to make the sacrifice of this hour seeing especially that the daughter has a husband of her own in the field with which she produced as it were her explanation i ve simply to see the truth of the matter see that maggie thinks more on the whole of fathers than of husbands and my situation is such she went on that this becomes immediately don t you understand a thing i have to count with mrs assingham vaguely heaving panting a little but trying not to show it turned about from some inward spring in her seat if you mean such a thing as that she doesn t adore the prince i don t say she doesn t adore him what i say is that she doesn t think of him one of those conditions doesn t always at all stages involve the other this is just how she adores him charlotte said and what reason is there in the world after all why he and i shouldn t as you say show together we ve shown together my dear she smiled before her friend for a little only looked at her speaking then with abruptness you ought to be absolutely happy you live with such good people the effect of it as well was an arrest for charlotte whose face however all of whose fine and slightly hard radiance it had caused the next instant further to brighten does one ever put into words anything so fatuously rash it s a thing that must be said in prudence for one by somebody who s so good as to take the responsibility the more that it gives one always a chance to show one s best manners by not contradicting it certainly you ll never have the distress or whatever of hearing me complain truly my dear i hope in all conscience not and the elder woman s spirit found relief in a laugh more resonant than was quite advised by their pursuit of privacy to this demonstration her friend gave no heed with all our absence after marriage and with the separation from her produced in particular by our so many months in america maggie has still arrears still losses to make up still the need of showing how for so long she simply kept missing him she missed his company a large allowance of which is in spite of everything else of the first necessity to her so she puts it in when she can a little here a little there and it ends by making up a considerable amount the fact of our distinct establishments which has all the same everything in its favour charlotte hastened to declare makes her really see more of him than when they had the same house to make sure she doesn t fail of it she s always arranging for it which she didn t have to do while they lived together but she likes to arrange charlotte steadily proceeded it peculiarly suits her and the result of our separate households is really for them more contact and more intimacy to night for instance has been practically an arrangement she likes him best alone and it s the way said our young woman in which he best likes her it s what i mean therefore by being placed and the great thing is as they say to know one s place doesn t it all strike you she wound up as rather placing the prince too fanny assingham had at this moment the sense as of a large heaped dish presented to her intelligence and inviting it to a feast so thick were the notes of intention in this remarkable speech but she also felt that to plunge at random to help herself too freely would apart from there not being at such a moment time for it tend to jostle the ministering hand confound the array and more vulgarly speaking make a mess so she picked out after consideration a solitary plum so placed that you have to arrange certainly i have to arrange and the prince also if the effect for him is the same really i think not less and does he arrange mrs assingham asked to make up his arrears the question had risen to her lips it was as if another morsel on the dish had tempted her the sound of it struck her own ear immediately as giving out more of her thought than she had as yet intended but she quickly saw that she must follow it up at any risk with simplicity and that what was simplest was the ease of boldness make them up i mean by coming to see you charlotte replied however without as her friend would have phrased it turning a hair she shook her head but it was beautifully gentle he never comes oh said fanny assingham with which she felt a little stupid there it is he might so well you know otherwise otherwise and fanny was still vague it passed this time over her companion whose eyes wandering to a distance found themselves held the prince was at hand again the ambassador was still at his side they were stopped a moment by a uniformed personage a little old man of apparently the highest military character bristling with medals and orders this gave charlotte time to go on he has not been for three months and then as with her friend s last word in her ear otherwise yes he arranges otherwise and in my position she added i might too it s too absurd we shouldn t meet you ve met i gather said fanny assingham to night yes as far as that goes but what i mean is that i might placed for it as we both are go to see him and do you fanny asked with almost mistaken solemnity the perception of this excess made charlotte whether for gravity or for irony hang fire a minute i have been but that s nothing she said in itself and i tell you of it only to show you how our situation works it essentially becomes one a situation for both of us the prince s however is his own affair i meant but to speak of mine your situation s perfect mrs assingham presently declared i don t say it isn t taken in fact all round i think it is and i don t as i tell you complain of it the only thing is that i have to act as it demands of me to act said mrs assingham with an irrepressible quaver isn t it acting my dear to accept it i do accept it what do you want me to do less i want you to believe that you re a very fortunate person do you call that less charlotte asked with a smile from the point of view of my freedom i call it more let it take my position any name you like don t let it at any rate and mrs assingham s impatience prevailed at last over her presence of mind don t let it make you think too much of your freedom i don t know what you call too much for how can i not see it as it is you d see your own quickly enough if the colonel gave you the same liberty and i haven t to tell you with your so much greater knowledge of everything what it is that gives such liberty most for yourself personally of course charlotte went on you only know the state of neither needing it nor missing it your husband doesn t treat you as of less importance to him than some other woman ah don t talk to me of other women fanny now overtly panted do you call mr verver s perfectly natural interest in his daughter the greatest affection of which he is capable charlotte took it up in all readiness i do distinctly and in spite of my having done all i could think of to make him capable of a greater i ve done earnestly everything i could i ve made it month after month my study but i haven t succeeded it has been vividly brought home to me to night however she pursued i ve hoped against hope for i recognise that as i told you at the time i was duly warned and then as she met in her friend s face the absence of any such remembrance he did tell me that he wanted me just because i could be useful about her with which charlotte broke into a wonderful smile so you see i am it was on fanny assingham s lips for the moment to reply that this was on the contrary exactly what she didn t see she came in fact within an ace of saying you strike me as having quite failed to help his idea to work since by your account maggie has him not less but so much more on her mind how in the world with so much of a remedy comes there to remain so much of what was to be obviated but she saved herself in time conscious above all that she was in presence of still deeper things than she had yet dared to fear that there was more in it than any admission she had made represented and she had held herself familiar with admissions so that not to seem to understand where she couldn t accept and not to seem to accept where she couldn t approve and could still less with precipitation advise she invoked the mere appearance of casting no weight whatever into the scales of her young friend s consistency the only thing was that as she was quickly enough to feel she invoked it rather to excess it brought her her invocation too abruptly to her feet she brushed away everything i can t conceive my dear what you re talking about charlotte promptly rose then as might be to meet it and her colour for the first time perceptibly heightened she looked for the minute as her companion had looked as if twenty protests blocking each other s way had surged up within her but when charlotte had to make a selection her selection was always the most effective possible it was happy now above all for being made not in anger but in sorrow you give me up then give you up you forsake me at the hour of my life when it seems to me i most deserve a friend s loyalty if you do you re not just fanny you re even i think she went on rather cruel and it s least of all worthy of you to seem to wish to quarrel with me in order to cover your desertion she spoke at the same time with the noblest moderation of tone and the image of high pale lighted disappointment she meanwhile presented as of a creature patient and lonely in her splendour was an impression so firmly imposed that she could fill her measure to the brim and yet enjoy the last word as it is called in such cases with a perfection void of any vulgarity of triumph she merely completed for truth s sake her demonstration what is a quarrel with me but a quarrel with my right to recognise the conditions of my bargain but i can carry them out alone she said as she turned away she turned to meet the ambassador and the prince who their colloquy with their field marshal ended were now at hand and had already between them she was aware addressed her a remark that failed to penetrate the golden glow in which her intelligence was temporarily bathed she had made her point the point she had foreseen she must make she had made it thoroughly and once for all so that no more making was required and her success was reflected in the faces of the two men of distinction before her unmistakably moved to admiration by her exceptional radiance she at first but watched this reflection taking no note of any less adequate form of it possibly presented by poor fanny poor fanny left to stare at her incurred score chalked up in so few strokes on the wall then she took in what the ambassador was saying in french what he was apparently repeating to her a desire for your presence madame has been expressed en tres haut lieu and i ve let myself in for the responsibility to say nothing of the honour of seeing as the most respectful of your friends that so august an impatience is not kept waiting the greatest possible personage had in short according to the odd formula of societies subject to the greatest personages possible sent for her and she asked in her surprise what in the world does he want to do to me only to know without looking that fanny s bewilderment was called to a still larger application and to hear the prince say with authority indeed with a certain prompt dryness you must go immediately it s a summons the ambassador using authority as well had already somehow possessed himself of her hand which he drew into his arm and she was further conscious as she went off with him that though still speaking for her benefit amerigo had turned to fanny assingham he would explain afterwards besides which she would understand for herself to fanny however he had laughed as a mark apparently that for this infallible friend no explanation at all would be necessary xv it may be recorded none the less that the prince was the next moment to see how little any such assumption was founded alone with him now mrs assingham was incorruptible they send for charlotte through you no my dear as you see through the ambassador ah but the ambassador and you for the last quarter of an hour have been for them as one he s your ambassador it may indeed be further mentioned that the more fanny looked at it the more she saw in it they ve connected her with you she s treated as your appendage oh my appendage the prince amusedly exclaimed cara mia what a name she s treated rather say as my ornament and my glory and it s so remarkable a case for a mother in law that you surely can t find fault with it you ve ornaments enough it seems to me as you ve certainly glories enough without her and she s not the least little bit mrs assingham observed your mother in law in such a matter a shade of difference is enormous she s no relation to you whatever and if she s known in high quarters but as going about with you then then she failed however as from positive intensity of vision then then what he asked with perfect good nature she had better in such a case not be known at all but i assure you i never just now so much as mentioned her do you suppose i asked them said the young man still amused if they didn t want to see her you surely don t need to be shown that charlotte speaks for herself that she does so above all on such an occasion as this and looking as she does to night how so looking can she pass unnoticed how can she not have success besides he added as she but watched his face letting him say what he would as if she wanted to see how he would say it besides there is always the fact that we re of the same connection of what is your word the same concern we re certainly not with the relation of our respective sposi simply formal acquaintances we re in the same boat and the prince smiled with a candour that added an accent to his emphasis fanny assingham was full of the special sense of his manner it caused her to turn for a moment s refuge to a corner of her general consciousness in which she could say to herself that she was glad she wasn t in love with such a man as with charlotte just before she was embarrassed by the difference between what she took in and what she could say what she felt and what she could show it only appears to me of great importance that now that you all seem more settled here charlotte should be known for any presentation any further circulation or introduction as in particular her husband s wife known in the least possible degree as anything else i don t know what you mean by the same boat charlotte is naturally in mr verver s boat and pray am i not in mr verver s boat too why but for mr verver s boat i should have been by this time and his quick italian gesture an expressive direction and motion of his forefinger pointed to deepest depths away down down down she knew of course what he meant how it had taken his father in law s great fortune and taken no small slice to surround him with an element in which all too fatally weighted as he had originally been he could pecuniarily float and with this reminder other things came to her how strange it was that with all allowance for their merit it should befall some people to be so inordinately valued quoted as they said in the stock market so high and how still stranger perhaps that there should be cases in which for some reason one didn t mind the so frequently marked absence in them of the purpose really to represent their price she was thinking feeling at any rate for herself she was thinking that the pleasure she could take in this specimen of the class didn t suffer from his consent to be merely made buoyant partly because it was one of those pleasures he inspired them that by their nature couldn t suffer to whatever proof they were put and partly because besides he after all visibly had on his conscience some sort of return for services rendered he was a huge expense assuredly but it had been up to now her conviction that his idea was to behave beautifully enough to make the beauty well nigh an equivalent and that he had carried out his idea carried it out by continuing to lead the life to breathe the air very nearly to think the thoughts that best suited his wife and her father this she had till lately enjoyed the comfort of so distinctly perceiving as to have even been moved more than once to express to him the happiness it gave her he had that in his favour as against other matters yet it discouraged her too and rather oddly that he should so keep moving and be able to show her that he moved on the firm ground of the truth his acknowledgment of obligation was far from unimportant but she could find in his grasp of the real itself a kind of ominous intimation the intimation appeared to peep at her even out of his next word lightly as he produced it isn t it rather as if we had charlotte and i for bringing us together a benefactor in common and the effect for his interlocutress was still further to be deepened i somehow feel half the time as if he were her father in law too it s as if he had saved us both which is a fact in our lives or at any rate in our hearts to make of itself a link don t you remember he kept it up how the day she suddenly turned up for you just before my wedding we so frankly and funnily talked in her presence of the advisability for her of some good marriage and then as his friend s face in her extremity quite again as with charlotte but continued to fly the black flag of general repudiation well we really began then as it seems to me the work of placing her where she is we were wholly right and so was she that it was exactly the thing is shown by its success we recommended a good marriage at almost any price so to speak and taking us at our word she has made the very best that was really what we meant wasn t it only what she has got something thoroughly good it would be difficult it seems to me for her to have anything better once you allow her the way it s to be taken of course if you don t allow her that the case is different her offset is a certain decent freedom which i judge she ll be quite contented with you may say that will be very good of her but she strikes me as perfectly humble about it she proposes neither to claim it nor to use it with any sort of retentissement she would enjoy it i think quite as quietly as it might be given the boat you see the prince explained it no less considerately and lucidly is a good deal tied up at the dock or anchored if you like out in the stream i have to jump out from time to time to stretch my legs and you ll probably perceive if you give it your attention that charlotte really can t help occasionally doing the same it isn t even a question sometimes of one s getting to the dock one has to take a header and splash about in the water call our having remained here together to night call the accident of my having put them put our illustrious friends there on my companion s track for i grant you this as a practical result of our combination call the whole thing one of the harmless little plunges off the deck inevitable for each of us why not take them when they occur as inevitable and above all as not endangering life or limb we shan t drown we shan t sink at least i can answer for myself mrs verver too moreover do her the justice visibly knows how to swim he could easily go on for she didn t interrupt him fanny felt now that she wouldn t have interrupted him for the world she found his eloquence precious there was not a drop of it that she didn t in a manner catch as it came for immediate bottling for future preservation the crystal flask of her innermost attention really received it on the spot and she had even already the vision of how in the snug laboratory of her afterthought she should be able chemically to analyse it there were moments positively still beyond this when with the meeting of their eyes something as yet unnamable came out for her in his look when something strange and subtle and at variance with his words something that gave them away glimmered deep down as an appeal almost an incredible one to her finer comprehension what inconceivably was it like wasn t it however gross such a rendering of anything so occult fairly like a quintessential wink a hint of the possibility of their really treating their subject of course on some better occasion and thereby as well finding it much more interesting if this far red spark which might have been figured by her mind as the head light of an approaching train seen through the length of a tunnel was not on her side an ignis fatuus a mere subjective phenomenon it twinkled there at the direct expense of what the prince was inviting her to understand meanwhile too however and unmistakably the real treatment of their subject did at a given moment sound this was when he proceeded with just the same perfect possession of his thought on the manner of which he couldn t have improved to complete his successful simile by another in fact by just the supreme touch the touch for which it had till now been waiting for mrs verver to be known to people so intensely and exclusively as her husband s wife something is wanted that you know they haven t exactly got he should manage to be known or at least to be seen a little more as his wife s husband you surely must by this time have seen for yourself that he has his own habits and his own ways and that he makes more and more as of course he has a perfect right to do his own discriminations he s so perfect so ideal a father and doubtless largely by that very fact a generous a comfortable an admirable father in law that i should really feel it base to avail myself of any standpoint whatever to criticise him to you nevertheless i may make just one remark for you re not stupid you always understand so blessedly what one means he paused an instant as if even this one remark might be difficult for him should she give no sign of encouraging him to produce it nothing would have induced her however to encourage him she was now conscious of having never in her life stood so still or sat inwardly as it were so tight she felt like the horse of the adage brought and brought by her own fault to the water but strong for the occasion in the one fact that she couldn t be forced to drink invited in other words to understand she held her breath for fear of showing she did and this for the excellent reason that she was at last fairly afraid to it was sharp for her at the same time that she was certain in advance of his remark that she heard it before it had sounded that she already tasted in fine the bitterness it would have for her special sensibility but her companion from an inward and different need of his own was presently not deterred by her silence what i really don t see is why from his own point of view given that is his conditions so fortunate as they stood he should have wished to marry at all there it was then exactly what she knew would come and exactly for reasons that seemed now to thump at her heart as distressing to her yet she was resolved meanwhile not to suffer as they used to say of the martyrs then and there not to suffer odiously helplessly in public which could be prevented but by her breaking off with whatever inconsequence by her treating their discussion as ended and getting away she suddenly wanted to go home much as she had wanted an hour or two before to come she wanted to leave well behind her both her question and the couple in whom it had abruptly taken such vivid form but it was dreadful to have the appearance of disconcerted flight discussion had of itself to her sense become danger such light as from open crevices it let in and the overt recognition of danger was worse than anything else the worst in fact came while she was thinking how she could retreat and still not overtly recognise her face had betrayed her trouble and with that she was lost i m afraid however the prince said that i for some reason distress you for which i beg your pardon we ve always talked so well together it has been from the beginning the greatest pull for me nothing so much as such a tone could have quickened her collapse she felt he had her now at his mercy and he showed as he went on that he knew it we shall talk again all the same better than ever i depend on it too much don t you remember what i told you so definitely one day before my marriage that moving as i did in so many ways among new things mysteries conditions expectations assumptions different from any i had known i looked to you as my original sponsor my fairy godmother to see me through i beg you to believe he added that i look to you yet his very insistence had fortunately the next moment affected her as bringing her help with which at least she could hold up her head to speak ah you are through you were through long ago or if you aren t you ought to be well then if i ought to be it s all the more reason why you should continue to help me because very distinctly i assure you i m not the new things or ever so many of them are still for me new things the mysteries and expectations and assumptions still contain an immense element that i ve failed to puzzle out as we ve happened so luckily to find ourselves again really taking hold together you must let me as soon as possible come to see you you must give me a good kind hour if you refuse it me and he addressed himself to her continued reserve i shall feel that you deny with a stony stare your responsibility at this as from a sudden shake her reserve proved an inadequate vessel she could bear her own her private reference to the weight on her mind but the touch of another hand made it too horribly press oh i deny responsibility to you so far as i ever had it i ve done with it he had been all the while beautifully smiling but she made his look now penetrate her again more as to whom then do you confess it ah mio caro that s if to anyone my own business he continued to look at her hard you give me up then it was what charlotte had asked her ten minutes before and its coming from him so much in the same way shook her in her place she was on the point of replying do you and she agree together for what you ll say to me but she was glad afterwards to have checked herself in time little as her actual answer had perhaps bettered it i think i don t know what to make of you you must receive me at least he said oh please not till i m ready for you and though she found a laugh for it she had to turn away she had never turned away from him before and it was quite positively for her as if she were altogether afraid of him xvi later on when their hired brougham had with the long vociferation that tormented her impatience been extricated from the endless rank she rolled into the london night beside her husband as into a sheltering darkness where she could muffle herself and draw breath she had stood for the previous half hour in a merciless glare beaten upon stared out of countenance it fairly seemed to her by intimations of her mistake for what she was most immediately feeling was that she had in the past been active for these people to ends that were now bearing fruit and that might yet bear a larger crop she but brooded at first in her corner of the carriage it was like burying her exposed face a face too helplessly exposed in the cool lap of the common indifference of the dispeopled streets of the closed shops and darkened houses seen through the window of the brougham a world mercifully unconscious and unreproachful it wouldn t like the world she had just left know sooner or later what she had done or would know it at least only if the final consequence should be some quite overwhelming publicity she fixed this possibility itself so hard however for a few moments that the misery of her fear produced the next minute a reaction and when the carriage happened while it grazed a turn to catch the straight shaft from the lamp of a policeman in the act of playing his inquisitive flash over an opposite house front she let herself wince at being thus incriminated only that she might protest not less quickly against mere blind terror it had become for the occasion preposterously terror of which she must shake herself free before she could properly measure her ground the perception of this necessity had in truth soon aided her since she found on trying that lurid as her prospect might hover there she could none the less give it no name the sense of seeing was strong in her but she clutched at the comfort of not being sure of what she saw not to know what it would represent on a longer view was a help in turn to not making out that her hands were embrued since if she had stood in the position of a producing cause she should surely be less vague about what she had produced this further in its way was a step toward reflecting that when one s connection with any matter was too indirect to be traced it might be described also as too slight to be deplored by the time they were nearing cadogan place she had in fact recognised that she couldn t be as curious as she desired without arriving at some conviction of her being as innocent but there had been a moment in the dim desert of eaton square when she broke into speech it s only their defending themselves so much more than they need it s only that that makes me wonder it s their having so remarkably much to say for themselves her husband had as usual lighted his cigar remaining apparently as busy with it as she with her agitation you mean it makes you feel that you have nothing to which as she made no answer the colonel added what in the world did you ever suppose was going to happen the man s in a position in which he has nothing in life to do her silence seemed to characterise this statement as superficial and her thoughts as always in her husband s company pursued an independent course he made her when they were together talk but as if for some other person who was in fact for the most part herself yet she addressed herself with him as she could never have done without him he has behaved beautifully he did from the first i ve thought it all along wonderful of him and i ve more than once when i ve had a chance told him so therefore therefore but it died away as she mused therefore he has a right for a change to kick up his heels it isn t a question of course however she undivertedly went on of their behaving beautifully apart it s a question of their doing as they should when together which is another matter and how do you think then the colonel asked with interest that when together they should do the less they do one would say the better if you see so much in it his wife at this appeared to hear him i don t see in it what you d see and don t my dear she further answered think it necessary to be horrid or low about them they re the last people really to make anything of that sort come in right i m surely never horrid or low he returned about anyone but my extravagant wife i can do with all our friends as i see them myself what i can t do with is the figures you make of them and when you take to adding your figures up but he exhaled it again in smoke my additions don t matter when you ve not to pay the bill with which her meditation again bore her through the air the great thing was that when it so suddenly came up for her he wasn t afraid if he had been afraid he could perfectly have prevented it and if i had seen he was if i hadn t seen he wasn t so said mrs assingham could i so she declared would i it s perfectly true she went on it was too good a thing for her such a chance in life not to be accepted and i liked his not keeping her out of it merely from a fear of his own nature it was so wonderful it should come to her the only thing would have been if charlotte herself couldn t have faced it then if she had not had confidence we might have talked but she had it to any amount did you ask her how much bob assingham patiently inquired he had put the question with no more than his usual modest hope of reward but he had pressed this time the sharpest spring of response never never it wasn t a time to ask asking is suggesting and it wasn t a time to suggest one had to make up one s mind as quietly as possible by what one could judge and i judge as i say that charlotte felt she could face it for which she struck me at the time as for so proud a creature almost touchingly grateful the thing i should never forgive her for would be her forgetting to whom it is her thanks have remained most due that is to mrs assingham she said nothing for a little there were after all alternatives maggie herself of course astonishing little maggie is maggie then astonishing too and he gloomed out of his window his wife on her side now as they rolled projected the same look i m not sure that i don t begin to see more in her than dear little person as i ve always thought i ever supposed there was i m not sure that putting a good many things together i m not beginning to make her out rather extraordinary you certainly will if you can the colonel resignedly remarked again his companion said nothing then again she broke out in fact i do begin to feel it maggie s the great comfort i m getting hold of it it will be she who ll see us through in fact she ll have to and she ll be able touch by touch her meditation had completed it but with a cumulative effect for her husband s general sense of her method that caused him to overflow whimsically enough in his corner into an ejaculation now frequent on his lips for the relief that especially in communion like the present it gave him and that fanny had critically traced to the quaint example the aboriginal homeliness still so delightful of mr verver oh lordy lordy if she is however mrs assingham continued she ll be extraordinary enough and that s what i m thinking of but i m not indeed so very sure she added of the person to whom charlotte ought in decency to be most grateful i mean i m not sure if that person is even almost the incredible little idealist who has made her his wife i shouldn t think you would be love the colonel with some promptness responded charlotte as the wife of an incredible little idealist his cigar in short once more could alone express it yet what is that when one thinks but just what she struck one as more or less persuaded that she herself was really going to be this memory for the full view fanny found herself also invoking it made her companion in truth slightly gape an incredible little idealist charlotte herself and she was sincere his wife simply proceeded she was unmistakably sincere the question is only how much is left of it and that i see happens to be another of the questions you can t ask her you have to do it all said bob assingham as if you were playing some game with its rules drawn up though who s to come down on you if you break them i don t quite see or must you do it in three guesses like forfeits on christmas eve to which as his ribaldry but dropped from her he further added how much of anything will have to be left for you to be able to go on with it i shall go on fanny assingham a trifle grimly declared while there s a scrap as big as your nail but we re not yet luckily reduced only to that she had another pause holding the while the thread of that larger perception into which her view of mrs verver s obligation to maggie had suddenly expanded even if her debt was not to the others even then it ought to be quite sufficiently to the prince himself to keep her straight for what really did the prince do she asked herself but generously trust her what did he do but take it from her that if she felt herself willing it was because she felt herself strong that creates for her upon my word mrs assingham pursued a duty of considering him of honourably repaying his trust which well which she ll be really a fiend if she doesn t make the law of her conduct i mean of course his trust that she wouldn t interfere with him expressed by his holding himself quiet at the critical time the brougham was nearing home and it was perhaps this sense of ebbing opportunity that caused the colonel s next meditation to flower in a fashion almost surprising to his wife they were united for the most part but by his exhausted patience so that indulgent despair was generally at the best his note he at present however actually compromised with his despair to the extent of practically admitting that he had followed her steps he literally asked in short an intelligent well nigh a sympathising question gratitude to the prince for not having put a spoke in her wheel that you mean should taking it in the right way be precisely the ballast of her boat taking it in the right way fanny catching at this gleam emphasised the proviso but doesn t it rather depend on what she may most feel to be the right way no it depends on nothing because there s only one way for duty or delicacy oh delicacy bob assingham rather crudely murmured i mean the highest kind moral charlotte s perfectly capable of appreciating that by every dictate of moral delicacy she must let him alone then you ve made up your mind it s all poor charlotte he asked with an effect of abruptness the effect whether intended or not reached her brought her face short round it was a touch at which she again lost her balance at which somehow the bottom dropped out of her recovered comfort then you ve made up yours differently it really struck you that there is something the movement itself apparently made him once more stand off he had felt on his nearer approach the high temperature of the question perhaps that s just what she s doing showing him how much she s letting him alone pointing it out to him from day to day did she point it out by waiting for him to night on the stair case in the manner you described to me i really my dear described to you a manner the colonel clearly from want of habit scarce recognised himself in the imputation yes for once in a way in those few words we had after you had watched them come up you told me something of what you had seen you didn t tell me very much that you couldn t for your life but i saw for myself that strange to say you had received your impression and i felt therefore that there must indeed have been something out of the way for you so to betray it she was fully upon him now and she confronted him with his proved sensibility to the occasion confronted him because of her own uneasy need to profit by it it came over her still more than at the time it came over her that he had been struck with something even he poor dear man and that for this to have occurred there must have been much to be struck with she tried in fact to corner him to pack him insistently down in the truth of his plain vision the very plainness of which was its value for so recorded she felt none of it would escape she should have it at hand for reference come my dear you thought what you thought in the presence of what you saw you couldn t resist thinking i don t ask more of it than that and your idea is worth this time quite as much as any of mine so that you can t pretend as usual that mine has run away with me i haven t caught up with you i stay where i am but i see she concluded where you are and i m much obliged to you for letting me you give me a point de repere outside myself which is where i like it now i can work round you their conveyance as she spoke stopped at their door and it was on the spot another fact of value for her that her husband though seated on the side by which they must alight made no movement they were in a high degree votaries of the latch key so that their household had gone to bed and as they were unaccompanied by a footman the coachman waited in peace it was so indeed that for a minute bob assingham waited conscious of a reason for replying to this address otherwise than by the so obvious method of turning his back he didn t turn his face but he stared straight before him and his wife had already perceived in the fact of his not moving all the proof she could desire proof that is of her own contention she knew he never cared what she said and his neglect of his chance to show it was thereby the more eloquent leave it he at last remarked to them leave it she wondered let them alone they ll manage they ll manage you mean to do everything they want ah there then you are they ll manage in their own way the colonel almost cryptically repeated it had its effect for her quite apart from its light on the familiar phenomenon of her husband s indurated conscience it gave her full in her face the particular evocation of which she had made him guilty it was wonderful truly then the evocation so cleverly that s your idea that no one will be the wiser it s your idea that we shall have done all that s required of us if we simply protect them the colonel still in his place declined however to be drawn into a statement of his idea statements were too much like theories in which one lost one s way he only knew what he said and what he said represented the limited vibration of which his confirmed old toughness had been capable still none the less he had his point to make for which he took another instant but he made it for the third time in the same fashion they ll manage in their own way with which he got out oh yes at this for his companion it had indeed its effect and while he mounted their steps she but stared without following him at his opening of their door their hall was lighted and as he stood in the aperture looking back at her his tall lean figure outlined in darkness and with his crush hat according to his wont worn cavalierly rather diabolically askew he seemed to prolong the sinister emphasis of his meaning in general on these returns he came back for her when he had prepared their entrance so that it was now as if he were ashamed to face her in closer quarters he looked at her across the interval and still in her seat weighing his charge she felt her whole view of everything flare up wasn t it simply what had been written in the prince s own face beneath what he was saying didn t it correspond with the mocking presence there that she had had her troubled glimpse of wasn t in fine the pledge that they would manage in their own way the thing he had been feeling for his chance to invite her to take from him her husband s tone somehow fitted amerigo s look the one that had for her so strangely peeped from behind over the shoulder of the one in front she had not then read it but wasn t she reading it when she now saw in it his surmise that she was perhaps to be squared she wasn t to be squared and while she heard her companion call across to her well what s the matter she also took time to remind herself that she had decided she couldn t be frightened the matter why it was sufficiently the matter with all this that she felt a little sick for it was not the prince that she had been prepared to regard as primarily the shaky one shakiness in charlotte she had at the most perhaps postulated it would be she somehow felt more easy to deal with therefore if he had come so far it was a different pair of sleeves there was nothing to choose between them it made her so helpless that as the time passed without her alighting the colonel came back and fairly drew her forth after which on the pavement under the street lamp their very silence might have been the mark of something grave their silence eked out for her by his giving her his arm and their then crawling up their steps quite mildly and unitedly together like some old darby and joan who have had a disappointment it almost resembled a return from a funeral unless indeed it resembled more the hushed approach to a house of mourning what indeed had she come home for but to bury as decently as possible her mistake xvii it appeared thus that they might enjoy together extraordinary freedom the two friends from the moment they should understand their position aright with the prince himself from an early stage not unnaturally charlotte had made a great point of their so understanding it she had found frequent occasion to describe to him this necessity and her resignation tempered or her intelligence at least quickened by irrepressible irony she applied at different times different names to the propriety of their case the wonderful thing was that her sense of propriety had been from the first especially alive about it there were hours when she spoke of their taking refuge in what she called the commonest tact as if this principle alone would suffice to light their way there were others when it might have seemed to listen to her that their course would demand of them the most anxious study and the most independent not to say original interpretation of signs she talked now as if it were indicated at every turn by finger posts of almost ridiculous prominence she talked again as if it lurked in devious ways and were to be tracked through bush and briar and she even on occasion delivered herself in the sense that as their situation was unprecedented so their heaven was without stars do she once had echoed to him as the upshot of passages covertly though briefly occurring between them on her return from the visit to america that had immediately succeeded her marriage determined for her by this event as promptly as an excursion of the like strange order had been prescribed in his own case isn t the immense the really quite matchless beauty of our position that we have to do nothing in life at all nothing except the usual necessary everyday thing which consists in one s not being more of a fool than one can help that s all but that s as true for one time as for another there has been plenty of doing and there will doubtless be plenty still but it s all theirs every inch of it it s all a matter of what they ve done to us and she showed how the question had therefore been only of their taking everything as everything came and all as quietly as might be nothing stranger surely had ever happened to a conscientious a well meaning a perfectly passive pair no more extraordinary decree had ever been launched against such victims than this of forcing them against their will into a relation of mutual close contact that they had done everything to avoid she was to remember not a little meanwhile the particular prolonged silent look with which the prince had met her allusion to these primary efforts at escape she was inwardly to dwell on the element of the unuttered that her tone had caused to play up into his irresistible eyes and this because she considered with pride and joy that she had on the spot disposed of the doubt the question the challenge or whatever else might have been that such a look could convey he had been sufficiently off his guard to show some little wonder as to their having plotted so very hard against their destiny and she knew well enough of course what in this connection was at the bottom of his thought and what would have sounded out more or less if he had not happily saved himself from words all men were brutes enough to catch when they might at such chances for dissent for all the good it really did them but the prince s distinction was in being one of the few who could check himself before acting on the impulse this obviously was what counted in a man as delicacy if her friend had blurted or bungled he would have said in his simplicity did we do everything to avoid it when we faced your remarkable marriage quite handsomely of course using the plural taking his share of the case by way of a tribute of memory to the telegram she had received from him in paris after mr verver had despatched to rome the news of their engagement that telegram that acceptance of the prospect proposed to them an acceptance quite other than perfunctory she had never destroyed though reserved for no eyes but her own it was still carefully reserved she kept it in a safe place from which very privately she sometimes took it out to read it over a la guerre comme a la guerre then it had been couched in the french tongue we must lead our lives as we see them but i am charmed with your courage and almost surprised at my own the message had remained ambiguous she had read it in more lights than one it might mean that even without her his career was up hill work for him a daily fighting matter on behalf of a good appearance and that thus if they were to become neighbours again the event would compel him to live still more under arms it might mean on the other hand that he found he was happy enough and that accordingly so far as she might imagine herself a danger she was to think of him as prepared in advance as really seasoned and secure on his arrival in paris with his wife none the less she had asked for no explanation just as he himself had not asked if the document were still in her possession such an inquiry everything implied was beneath him just as it was beneath herself to mention to him uninvited that she had instantly offered and in perfect honesty to show the telegram to mr verver and that if this companion had but said the word she would immediately have put it before him she had thereby forborne to call his attention to her consciousness that such an exposure would in all probability straightway have dished her marriage that all her future had in fact for the moment hung by the single hair of mr verver s delicacy as she supposed they must call it and that her position in the matter of responsibility was therefore inattackably straight for the prince himself meanwhile time in its measured allowance had originally much helped him helped him in the sense of there not being enough of it to trip him up in spite of which it was just this accessory element that seemed at present with wonders of patience to lie in wait time had begotten at first more than anything else separations delays and intervals but it was troublesomely less of an aid from the moment it began so to abound that he had to meet the question of what to do with it less of it was required for the state of being married than he had on the whole expected less strangely for the state of being married even as he was married and there was a logic in the matter he knew a logic that but gave this truth a sort of solidity of evidence mr verver decidedly helped him with it with his wedded condition helped him really so much that it made all the difference in the degree in which he rendered it the service on mr verver s part was remarkable as indeed what service from the first of their meeting had not been he was living he had been living these four or five years on mr verver s services a truth scarcely less plain if he dealt with them for appreciation one by one than if he poured them all together into the general pot of his gratitude and let the thing simmer to a nourishing broth to the latter way with them he was undoubtedly most disposed yet he would even thus on occasion pick out a piece to taste on its own merits wondrous at such hours could seem the savour of the particular treat at his father in law s expense that he more and more struck himself as enjoying he had needed months and months to arrive at a full appreciation he couldn t originally have given offhand a name to his deepest obligation but by the time the name had flowered in his mind he was practically living at the ease guaranteed him mr verver then in a word took care of his relation to maggie as he took care and apparently always would of everything else he relieved him of all anxiety about his married life in the same manner in which he relieved him on the score of his bank account and as he performed the latter office by communicating with the bankers so the former sprang as directly from his good understanding with his daughter this understanding had wonderfully that was in high evidence the same deep intimacy as the commercial the financial association founded far down on a community of interest and the correspondence for the prince carried itself out in identities of character the vision of which fortunately rather tended to amuse than to as might have happened irritate him those people and his free synthesis lumped together capitalists and bankers retired men of business illustrious collectors american fathers in law american fathers little american daughters little american wives those people were of the same large lucky group as one might say they were all at least of the same general species and had the same general instincts they hung together they passed each other the word they spoke each other s language they did each other turns in this last connection it of course came up for our young man at a given moment that maggie s relation with him was also on the perceived basis taken care of which was in fact the real upshot of the matter it was a funny situation that is it was funny just as it stood their married life was in question but the solution was not less strikingly before them it was all right for himself because mr verver worked it so for maggie s comfort and it was all right for maggie because he worked it so for her husband s the fact that time however was not as we have said wholly on the prince s side might have shown for particularly true one dark day on which by an odd but not unprecedented chance the reflections just noted offered themselves as his main recreation they alone it appeared had been appointed to fill the hours for him and even to fill the great square house in portland place where the scale of one of the smaller saloons fitted them but loosely he had looked into this room on the chance that he might find the princess at tea but though the fireside service of the repast was shiningly present the mistress of the table was not and he had waited for her if waiting it could be called while he measured again and again the stretch of polished floor he could have named to himself no pressing reason for seeing her at this moment and her not coming in as the half hour elapsed became in fact quite positively however perversely the circumstance that kept him on the spot just there he might have been feeling just there he could best take his note this observation was certainly by itself meagre amusement for a dreary little crisis but his walk to and fro and in particular his repeated pause at one of the high front windows gave each of the ebbing minutes none the less after a time a little more of the quality of a quickened throb of the spirit these throbs scarce expressed however the impatience of desire any more than they stood for sharp disappointment the series together resembled perhaps more than anything else those fine waves of clearness through which for a watcher of the east dawn at last trembles into rosy day the illumination indeed was all for the mind the prospect revealed by it a mere immensity of the world of thought the material outlook was all the while a different matter the march afternoon judged at the window had blundered back into autumn it had been raining for hours and the colour of the rain the colour of the air of the mud of the opposite houses of life altogether in so grim a joke so idiotic a masquerade was an unutterable dirty brown there was at first even for the young man no faint flush in the fact of the direction taken while he happened to look out by a slow jogging four wheeled cab which awkwardly deflecting from the middle course at the apparent instance of a person within began to make for the left hand pavement and so at last under further instructions floundered to a full stop before the prince s windows the person within alighting with an easier motion proved to be a lady who left the vehicle to wait and putting up no umbrella quickly crossed the wet interval that separated her from the house she but flitted and disappeared yet the prince from his standpoint had had time to recognise her and the recognition kept him for some minutes motionless charlotte stant at such an hour in a shabby four wheeler and a waterproof charlotte stant turning up for him at the very climax of his special inner vision was an apparition charged with a congruity at which he stared almost as if it had been a violence the effect of her coming to see him him only had while he stood waiting a singular intensity though after some minutes had passed the certainty of this began to drop perhaps she had not come or had come only for maggie perhaps on learning below that the princess had not returned she was merely leaving a message writing a word on a card he should see at any rate and meanwhile controlling himself would do nothing this thought of not interfering took on a sudden force for him she would doubtless hear he was at home but he would let her visit to him be all of her own choosing and his view of a reason for leaving her free was the more remarkable that though taking no step he yet intensely hoped the harmony of her breaking into sight while the superficial conditions were so against her was a harmony with conditions that were far from superficial and that gave for his imagination an extraordinary value to her presence the value deepened strangely moreover with the rigour of his own attitude with the fact too that listening hard he neither heard the house door close again nor saw her go back to her cab and it had risen to a climax by the time he had become aware with his quickened sense that she had followed the butler up to the landing from which his room opened if anything could further then have added to it the renewed pause outside as if she had said to the man wait a moment would have constituted this touch yet when the man had shown her in had advanced to the tea table to light the lamp under the kettle and had then busied himself all deliberately with the fire she made it easy for her host to drop straight from any height of tension and to meet her provisionally on the question of maggie while the butler remained it was maggie that she had come to see and maggie that in spite of this attendant s high blankness on the subject of all possibilities on that lady s part she would cheerfully by the fire wait for as soon as they were alone together however she mounted as with the whizz and the red light of a rocket from the form to the fact saying straight out as she stood and looked at him what else my dear what in the world else can we do it was as if he then knew on the spot why he had been feeling for hours as he had felt as if he in fact knew within the minute things he had not known even while she was panting as from the effect of the staircase at the door of the room he knew at the same time none the less that she knew still more than he in the sense that is of all the signs and portents that might count for them and his vision of alternative she could scarce say what to call them solutions satisfactions opened out altogether with this tangible truth of her attitude by the chimney place the way she looked at him as through the gained advantage of it her right hand resting on the marble and her left keeping her skirt from the fire while she held out a foot to dry he couldn t have told what particular links and gaps had at the end of a few minutes found themselves renewed and bridged for he remembered no occasion in rome from which the picture could have been so exactly copied he remembered that is none of her coming to see him in the rain while a muddy four wheeler waited and while though having left her waterproof downstairs she was yet invested with the odd eloquence the positive picturesqueness yes given all the rest of the matter of a dull dress and a black bowdlerised hat that seemed to make a point of insisting on their time of life and their moral intention the hat s and the frock s own as well as on the irony of indifference to them practically playing in her so handsome rain freshened face the sense of the past revived for him nevertheless as it had not yet done it made that other time somehow meet the future close interlocking with it before his watching eyes as in a long embrace of arms and lips and so handling and hustling the present that this poor quantity scarce retained substance enough scarce remained sufficiently there to be wounded or shocked what had happened in short was that charlotte and he had by a single turn of the wrist of fate led up to indeed no doubt by steps and stages that conscious computation had missed been placed face to face in a freedom that partook extraordinarily of ideal perfection since the magic web had spun itself without their toil almost without their touch above all on this occasion once more there sounded through their safety as an undertone the very voice he had listened to on the eve of his marriage with such another sort of unrest dimly again and again from that period on he had seemed to hear it tell him why it kept recurring but it phrased the large music now in a way that filled the room the reason was into which he had lived quite intimately by the end of a quarter of an hour that just this truth of their safety offered it now a kind of unexampled receptacle letting it spread and spread but at the same time elastically enclosing it banking it in for softness as with billows of eiderdown on that morning in the park there had been however dissimulated doubt and danger whereas the tale this afternoon was taken up with a highly emphasised confidence the emphasis for their general comfort was what charlotte had come to apply inasmuch as though it was not what she definitely began with it had soon irrepressibly shaped itself it was the meaning of the question she had put to him as soon as they were alone even though indeed as from not quite understanding he had not then directly replied it was the meaning of everything else down to the conscious quaintness of her ricketty growler and the conscious humility of her dress it had helped him a little the question of these eccentricities to let her immediate appeal pass without an answer he could ask her instead what had become of her carriage and why above all she was not using it in such weather it s just because of the weather she explained it s my little idea it makes me feel as i used to when i could do as i liked xviii this came out so straight that he saw at once how much truth it expressed yet it was truth that still a little puzzled him but did you ever like knocking about in such discomfort it seems to me now that i then liked everything it s the charm at any rate she said from her place at the fire of trying again the old feelings they come back they come back everything she went on comes back besides she wound up you know for yourself he stood near her his hands in his pockets but not looking at her looking hard at the tea table ah i haven t your courage moreover he laughed it seems to me that so far as that goes i do live in hansoms but you must awfully want your tea he quickly added so let me give you a good stiff cup he busied himself with this care and she sat down on his pushing up a low seat where she had been standing so that while she talked he could bring her what she further desired he moved to and fro before her he helped himself and her visit as the moments passed had more and more the effect of a signal communication that she had come all responsibly and deliberately as on the clear show of the clock face of their situation to make the whole demonstration none the less presented itself as taking place at a very high level of debate in the cool upper air of the finer discrimination the deeper sincerity the larger philosophy no matter what were the facts invoked and arrayed it was only a question as yet of their seeing their way together to which indeed exactly the present occasion appeared to have so much to contribute it s not that you haven t my courage charlotte said but that you haven t i rather think my imagination unless indeed it should turn out after all she added that you haven t even my intelligence however i shall not be afraid of that till you ve given me more proof and she made again but more clearly her point of a moment before you knew besides you knew to day i would come and if you knew that you know everything so she pursued and if he didn t meanwhile if he didn t even at this take her up it might be that she was so positively fitting him again with the fair face of temporising kindness that he had given her to keep her eyes on at the other important juncture and the sense of which she might ever since have been carrying about with her like a precious medal not exactly blessed by the pope suspended round her neck she had come back however this might be to her immediate account of herself and no mention of their great previous passage was to rise to the lips of either above all she said there has been the personal romance of it of tea with me over the fire ah so far as that goes i don t think even my intelligence fails me oh it s further than that goes and if i ve had a better day than you it s perhaps when i come to think of it that i am braver you bore yourself you see but i don t i don t i don t she repeated it s precisely boring one s self without relief he protested that takes courage passive then not active my romance is that if you want to know i ve been all day on the town literally on the town isn t that what they call it i know how it feels after which as if breaking off and you have you never been out she asked he still stood there with his hands in his pockets what should i have gone out for oh what should people in our case do anything for but you re wonderful all of you you know how to live we re clumsy brutes we other s beside you we must always be doing something however charlotte pursued if you had gone out you might have missed the chance of me which i m sure though you won t confess it was what you didn t want and might have missed above all the satisfaction that look blank about it as you will i ve come to congratulate you on that s really what i can at last do you can t not know at least on such a day as this you can t not know she said where you are she waited as for him either to grant that he knew or to pretend that he didn t but he only drew a long deep breath which came out like a moan of impatience it brushed aside the question of where he was or what he knew it seemed to keep the ground clear for the question of his visitor herself that of charlotte verver exactly as she sat there so for some moments with their long look they but treated the matter in silence with the effect indeed by the end of the time of having considerably brought it on this was sufficiently marked in what charlotte next said there it all is extraordinary beyond words it makes such a relation for us as i verily believe was never before in the world thrust upon two well meaning creatures haven t we therefore to take things as we find them she put the question still more directly than that of a moment before but to this one as well he returned no immediate answer noticing only that she had finished her tea he relieved her of her cup carried it back to the table asked her what more she would have and then on her nothing thanks returned to the fire and restored a displaced log to position by a small but almost too effectual kick she had meanwhile got up again and it was on her feet that she repeated the words she had first frankly spoken what else can we do what in all the world else he took them up however no more than at first where then have you been he asked as from mere interest in her adventure everywhere i could think of except to see people i didn t want people i wanted too much to think but i ve been back at intervals three times and then come away again my cabman must think me crazy it s very amusing i shall owe him when we come to settle more money than he has ever seen i ve been my dear she went on to the british museum which you know i always adore and i ve been to the national gallery and to a dozen old booksellers coming across treasures and i ve lunched on some strange nastiness at a cookshop in holborn i wanted to go to the tower but it was too far my old man urged that and i would have gone to the zoo if it hadn t been too wet which he also begged me to observe but you wouldn t believe i did put in st paul s such days she wound up are expensive for besides the cab i ve bought quantities of books she immediately passed at any rate to another point i can t help wondering when you must last have laid eyes on them and then as it had apparently for her companion an effect of abruptness maggie i mean and the child for i suppose you know he s with her oh yes i know he s with her i saw them this morning and did they then announce their programme she told me she was taking him as usual da nonno and for the whole day he hesitated but it was as if his attitude had slowly shifted she didn t say and i didn t ask well she went on it can t have been later than half past ten i mean when you saw them they had got to eaton square before eleven you know we don t formally breakfast adam and i we have tea in our rooms at least i have but luncheon is early and i saw my husband this morning by twelve he was showing the child a picture book maggie had been there with them had left them settled together then she had gone out taking the carriage for something he had been intending but that she offered to do instead the prince appeared to confess at this to his interest taking you mean your carriage i don t know which and it doesn t matter it s not a question she smiled of a carriage the more or the less it s not a question even if you come to that of a cab it s so beautiful she said that it s not a question of anything vulgar or horrid which she gave him time to agree about and though he was silent it was rather remarkably as if he fell in i went out i wanted to i had my idea it seemed to me important it has been it is important i know as i haven t known before the way they feel i couldn t in any other way have made so sure of it they feel a confidence the prince observed he had indeed said it for her they feel a confidence and she proceeded with lucidity to the fuller illustration of it speaking again of the three different moments that in the course of her wild ramble had witnessed her return for curiosity and even really a little from anxiety to eaton square she was possessed of a latch key rarely used it had always irritated adam one of the few things that did to find servants standing up so inhumanly straight when they came home in the small hours after parties so i had but to slip in each time with my cab at the door and make out for myself without their knowing it that maggie was still there i came i went without their so much as dreaming what do they really suppose she asked becomes of one not so much sentimentally or morally so to call it and since that doesn t matter but even just physically materially as a mere wandering woman as a decent harmless wife after all as the best stepmother after all that really ever was or at the least simply as a maitresse de maison not quite without a conscience they must even in their odd way she declared have some idea oh they ve a great deal of idea said the prince and nothing was easier than to mention the quantity they think so much of us they think in particular so much of you ah don t put it all on me she smiled but he was putting it now where she had admirably prepared the place it s a matter of your known character ah thank you for known she still smiled it s a matter of your wonderful cleverness and wonderful charm it s a matter of what those things have done for you in the world i mean in this world and this place you re a personage for them and personages do go and come oh no my dear there you re quite wrong and she laughed now in the happier light they had diffused that s exactly what personages don t do they live in state and under constant consideration they haven t latch keys but drums and trumpets announce them and when they go out in growlers it makes a greater noise still it s you caro mio she said who so far as that goes are the personage ah he in turn protested don t put it all on me what at any rate when you get home he added shall you say that you ve been doing i shall say beautifully that i ve been here all day yes all day keeping you company in your solitude how can we understand anything she went on without really seeing that this is what they must like to think i do for you just as quite as comfortably you do it for me the thing is for us to learn to take them as they are he considered this a while in his restless way but with his eyes not turning from her after which rather disconnectedly though very vehemently he brought out how can i not feel more than anything else how they adore together my boy and then further as if slightly disconcerted she had nothing to meet this and he quickly perceived the effect they would have done the same for one of yours ah if i could have had one i hoped and i believed said charlotte that that would happen it would have been better it would have made perhaps some difference he thought so too poor duck that it might have been i m sure he hoped and intended so it s not at any rate she went on my fault there it is she had uttered these statements one by one gravely sadly and responsibly owing it to her friend to be clear she paused briefly but as if once for all she made her clearness complete and now i m too sure it will never be he waited for a moment never never they treated the matter not exactly with solemnity but with a certain decency even perhaps urgency of distinctness it would probably have been better charlotte added but things turn out and it leaves us she made the point more alone he seemed to wonder it leaves you more alone oh she again returned don t put it all on me maggie would have given herself to his child i m sure scarcely less than he gives himself to yours it would have taken more than any child of mine she explained it would have taken more than ten children of mine could i have had them to keep our sposi apart she smiled as for the breadth of the image but as he seemed to take it in spite of this for important she then spoke gravely enough it s as strange as you like but we re immensely alone he kept vaguely moving but there were moments when again with an awkward ease and his hands in his pockets he was more directly before her he stood there at these last words which had the effect of making him for a little throw back his head and as thinking something out stare up at the ceiling what will you say she meanwhile asked that you ve been doing this brought his consciousness and his eyes back to her and she pointed her question i mean when she comes in for i suppose she will some time come in it seems to me we must say the same thing well he thought again yet i can scarce pretend to have had what i haven t ah what haven t you had what aren t you having her question rang out as they lingered face to face and he still took it before he answered from her eyes we must at least then not to be absurd together do the same thing we must act it would really seem in concert it would really seem her eyebrows her shoulders went up quite in gaiety as for the relief this brought her it s all in the world i pretend we must act in concert heaven knows she said they do so it was that he evidently saw and that by his admission the case could fairly be put but what he evidently saw appeared to come over him at the same time as too much for him so that he fell back suddenly to ground where she was not awaiting him the difficulty is and will always be that i don t understand them i didn t at first but i thought i should learn to that was what i hoped and it appeared then that fanny assingham might help me oh fanny assingham said charlotte verver he stared a moment at her tone she would do anything for us to which charlotte at first said nothing as if from the sense of too much then indulgently enough she shook her head we re beyond her he thought a moment as of where this placed them she d do anything then for them well so would we so that doesn t help us she has broken down she doesn t understand us and really my dear charlotte added fanny assingham doesn t matter he wondered again unless as taking care of them ah charlotte instantly said isn t it for us only to do that she spoke as with a flare of pride for their privilege and their duty i think we want no one s aid she spoke indeed with a nobleness not the less effective for coming in so oddly with a sincerity visible even through the complicated twist by which any effort to protect the father and the daughter seemed necessarily conditioned for them it moved him in any case as if some spring of his own a weaker one had suddenly been broken by it these things all the while the privilege the duty the opportunity had been the substance of his own vision they formed the note he had been keeping back to show her that he was not in their so special situation without a responsible view a conception that he could name and could act on was something that now at last not to be too eminent a fool he was required by all the graces to produce and the luminous idea she had herself uttered would have been his expression of it she had anticipated him but as her expression left for positive beauty nothing to be desired he felt rather righted than wronged a large response as he looked at her came into his face a light of excited perception all his own in the glory of which as it almost might be called what he gave her back had the value of what she had given him they re extraordinarily happy oh charlotte s measure of it was only too full beatifically that s the great thing he went on so that it doesn t matter really that one doesn t understand besides you do enough i understand my husband perhaps she after an instant conceded i don t understand your wife you re of the same race at any rate more or less of the same general tradition and education of the same moral paste there are things you have in common with them but i on my side as i ve gone on trying to see if i haven t some of these things too i on my side have more and more failed there seem at last to be none worth mentioning i can t help seeing it i m decidedly too different yet you re not charlotte made the important point too different from me i don t know as we re not married that brings things out perhaps if we were he said you would find some abyss of divergence since it depends on that then she smiled i m safe as you are anyhow moreover as one has so often had occasion to feel and even to remark they re very very simple that makes she added a difficulty for belief but when once one has taken it in it makes less difficulty for action i have at last for myself i think taken it in i m not afraid he wondered a moment not afraid of what well generally of some beastly mistake especially of any mistake founded on one s idea of their difference for that idea charlotte developed positively makes one so tender ah but rather well then there it is i can t put myself into maggie s skin i can t as i say it s not my fit i shouldn t be able as i see it to breathe in it but i can feel that i d do anything to shield it from a bruise tender as i am for her too she went on i think i m still more so for my husband he s in truth of a sweet simplicity the prince turned over a while the sweet simplicity of mr verver well i don t know that i can choose at night all cats are grey i only see how for so many reasons we ought to stand toward them and how to do ourselves justice we do it represents for us a conscious care of every hour literally said charlotte she could rise to the highest measure of the facts and for which we must trust each other oh as we trust the saints in glory fortunately the prince hastened to add we can with which as for the full assurance and the pledge it involved their hands instinctively found their hands it s all too wonderful firmly and gravely she kept his hand it s too beautiful and so for a minute they stood together as strongly held and as closely confronted as any hour of their easier past even had seen them they were silent at first only facing and faced only grasping and grasped only meeting and met it s sacred he said at last it s sacred she breathed back to him they vowed it gave it out and took it in drawn by their intensity more closely together then of a sudden through this tightened circle as at the issue of a narrow strait into the sea beyond everything broke up broke down gave way melted and mingled their lips sought their lips their pressure their response and their response their pressure with a violence that had sighed itself the next moment to the longest and deepest of stillnesses they passionately sealed their pledge xix he had taken it from her as we have seen moreover that fanny assingham didn t now matter the now he had even himself supplied as no more than fair to his sense of various earlier stages and though his assent remained scarce more than tacit his behaviour for the hour so fell into line that for many days he kept postponing the visit he had promised his old friend on the occasion of their talk at the foreign office with regret none the less would he have seen it quite extinguished that theory of their relation as attached pupil and kind instructress in which they had from the first almost equally found a convenience it had been he no doubt who had most put it forward since his need of knowledge fairly exceeded her mild pretension but he had again and again repeated to her that he should never without her have been where he was and she had not successfully concealed the pleasure it might give her to believe it even after the question of where he was had begun to show itself as rather more closed than open to interpretation it had never indeed before that evening come up as during the passage at the official party and he had for the first time at those moments a little disappointedly got the impression of a certain failure on the dear woman s part of something he was aware of having always rather freely taken for granted in her of what exactly the failure consisted he would still perhaps have felt it a little harsh to try to say and if she had in fact as by charlotte s observation broken down the details of the collapse would be comparatively unimportant they came to the same thing all such collapses the failure of courage the failure of friendship or the failure just simply of tact for didn t any one of them by itself amount really to the failure of wit which was the last thing he had expected of her and which would be but another name for the triumph of stupidity it had been charlotte s remark that they were at last beyond her whereas he had ever enjoyed believing that a certain easy imagination in her would keep up with him to the end he shrank from affixing a label to mrs assingham s want of faith but when he thought at his ease of the way persons who were capable really entertained or at least with any refinement the passion of personal loyalty he figured for them a play of fancy neither timorous nor scrupulous so would his personal loyalty if need be have accepted the adventure for the good creature herself to that definite degree that he had positively almost missed the luxury of some such call from her that was what it all came back to again with these people among whom he was married that one found one used one s imagination mainly for wondering how they contrived so little to appeal to it he felt at moments as if there were never anything to do for them that was worthy to call worthy of the personal relation never any charming charge to take of any confidence deeply reposed he might vulgarly have put it that one had never to plot or to lie for them he might humourously have put it that one had never as by the higher conformity to lie in wait with the dagger or to prepare insidiously the cup these were the services that by all romantic tradition were consecrated to affection quite as much as to hate but he could amuse himself with saying so far as the amusement went that they were what he had once for all turned his back on fanny was meanwhile frequent it appeared in eaton square so much he gathered from the visitor who was not infrequent least of all at tea time during the same period in portland place though they had little need to talk of her after practically agreeing that they had outlived her to the scene of these conversations and suppressions mrs assingham herself made actually no approach her latest view of her utility seeming to be that it had found in eaton square its most urgent field it was finding there in fact everything and everyone but the prince who mostly just now kept away or who at all events on the interspaced occasions of his calling happened not to encounter the only person from whom he was a little estranged it would have been all prodigious if he had not already with charlotte s aid so very considerably lived into it it would have been all indescribably remarkable this fact that with wonderful causes for it so operating on the surface nobody else as yet in the combination seemed estranged from anybody if mrs assingham delighted in maggie she knew by this time how most easily to reach her and if she was unhappy about charlotte she knew by the same reasoning how most probably to miss that vision of her on which affliction would feed it might feed of course on finding her so absent from her home just as this particular phenomenon of her domestic detachment could be by the anxious mind best studied there fanny was however for her reasons shy of portland place itself this was appreciable so that she might well after all have no great light on the question of whether charlotte s appearances there were frequent or not any more than on that of the account they might be keeping of the usual solitude since it came to this of the head of that house there was always to cover all ambiguities to constitute a fund of explanation for the divisions of mrs verver s day the circumstance that at the point they had all reached together mrs verver was definitely and by general acclamation in charge of the social relations of the family literally of those of the two households as to her genius for representing which in the great world and in the grand style vivid evidence had more and more accumulated it had been established in the two households at an early stage and with the highest good humour that charlotte was a was the social success whereas the princess though kind though punctilious though charming though in fact the dearest little creature in the world and the princess into the bargain was distinctly not would distinctly never be and might as well practically give it up whether through being above it or below it too much outside of it or too much lost in it too unequipped or too indisposed didn t especially matter what sufficed was that the whole thing call it appetite or call it patience the act of representation at large and the daily business of intercourse fell in with charlotte s tested facility and not much less visibly with her accommodating her generous view of her domestic use she had come frankly into the connection to do and to be what she could no questions asked and she had taken over accordingly as it stood and in the finest practical spirit the burden of a visiting list that maggie originally left to herself and left even more to the principino had suffered to get inordinately out of hand she had in a word not only mounted cheerfully the london treadmill she had handsomely professed herself for the further comfort of the three others sustained in the effort by a frivolous side if that were not too harsh a name for a pleasant constitutional curiosity there were possibilities of dulness ponderosities of practice arid social sands the bad quarters of an hour that turned up like false pieces in a debased currency of which she made on principle very nearly as light as if she had not been clever enough to distinguish the prince had on this score paid her his compliment soon after her return from her wedding tour in america where by all accounts she had wondrously borne the brunt facing brightly at her husband s side everything that came up and what had come often was beyond words just as precisely with her own interest only at stake she had thrown up the game during the visit paid before her marriage the discussion of the american world the comparison of notes impressions and adventures had been all at hand as a ground of meeting for mrs verver and her husband s son in law from the hour of the reunion of the two couples thus it had been in short that charlotte could for her friend s appreciation so promptly make her point even using expressions from which he let her see at the hour that he drew amusement of his own what could be more simple than one s going through with everything she had asked when it s so plain a part of one s contract i ve got so much by my marriage for she had never for a moment concealed from him how much she had felt it and was finding it that i should deserve no charity if i stinted my return not to do that to give back on the contrary all one can are just one s decency and one s honour and one s virtue these things henceforth if you re interested to know are my rule of life the absolute little gods of my worship the holy images set up on the wall oh yes since i m not a brute she had wound up you shall see me as i am which was therefore as he had seen her dealing always from month to month from day to day and from one occasion to the other with the duties of a remunerated office her perfect her brilliant efficiency had doubtless all the while contributed immensely to the pleasant ease in which her husband and her husband s daughter were lapped it had in fact probably done something more than this it had given them a finer and sweeter view of the possible scope of that ease they had brought her in on the crudest expression of it to do the worldly for them and she had done it with such genius that they had themselves in consequence renounced it even more than they had originally intended in proportion as she did it moreover was she to be relieved of other and humbler doings which minor matters by the properest logic devolved therefore upon maggie in whose chords and whose province they more naturally lay not less naturally by the same token they included the repair at the hands of the latter young woman of every stitch conceivably dropped by charlotte in eaton square this was homely work but that was just what made it maggie s bearing in mind dear amerigo who was so much of her own great mundane feather and whom the homeliness in question didn t no doubt quite equally provide for that would be to balance just in a manner charlotte s very most charming function from the moment charlotte could be got adequately to recognise it well that charlotte might be appraised as at last not ineffectually recognising it was a reflection that during the days with which we are actually engaged completed in the prince s breast these others these images and ruminations of his leisure these gropings and fittings of his conscience and his experience that we have attempted to set in order there they bore him company not insufficiently considering in especial his fuller resources in that line while he worked out to the last lucidity the principle on which he forbore either to seek fanny out in cadogan place or to perpetrate the error of too marked an assiduity in eaton square this error would be his not availing himself to the utmost of the convenience of any artless theory of his constitution or of charlotte s that might prevail there that artless theories could and did prevail was a fact he had ended by accepting under copious evidence as definite and ultimate and it consorted with common prudence with the simplest economy of life not to be wasteful of any odd gleaning to haunt eaton square in fine would be to show that he had not like his brilliant associate a sufficiency of work in the world it was just his having that sufficiency it was just their having it together that so strangely and so blessedly made as they put it to each other everything possible what further propped up the case moreover was that the world by still another beautiful perversity of their chance included portland place without including to anything like the same extent eaton square the latter residence at the same time it must promptly be added did on occasion wake up to opportunity and as giving itself a frolic shake send out a score of invitations one of which fitful flights precisely had before easter the effect of disturbing a little our young man s measure of his margin maggie with a proper spirit held that her father ought from time to time to give a really considered dinner and mr verver who had as little idea as ever of not meeting expectation was of the harmonious opinion that his wife ought charlotte s own judgment was always that they were ideally free the proof of which would always be she maintained that everyone they feared they might most have alienated by neglect would arrive wreathed with smiles on the merest hint of a belated signal wreathed in smiles all round truly enough these apologetic banquets struck amerigo as being they were frankly touching occasions to him marked in the great london bousculade with a small still grace of their own an investing amenity and humanity everybody came everybody rushed but all succumbed to the soft influence and the brutality of mere multitude of curiosity without tenderness was put off at the foot of the fine staircase with the overcoats and shawls the entertainment offered a few evenings before easter and at which maggie and he were inevitably present as guests was a discharge of obligations not insistently incurred and had thereby possibly all the more the note of this almost arcadian optimism a large bright dull murmurous mild eyed middle aged dinner involving for the most part very bland though very exalted immensely announceable and hierarchically placeable couples and followed without the oppression of a later contingent by a brief instrumental concert over the preparation of which the prince knew maggie s anxiety had conferred with charlotte s ingenuity and both had supremely revelled as it were in mr verver s solvency the assinghams were there by prescription though quite at the foot of the social ladder and with the colonel s wife in spite of her humility of position the prince was more inwardly occupied than with any other person except charlotte he was occupied with charlotte because in the first place she looked so inordinately handsome and held so high where so much else was mature and sedate the torch of responsive youth and the standard of passive grace and because of the fact that in the second the occasion so far as it referred itself with any confidence of emphasis to a hostess seemed to refer itself preferentially well meaningly and perversely to maggie it was not indistinguishable to him when once they were all stationed that his wife too had in perfection her own little character but he wondered how it managed so visibly to simplify itself and this he knew in spite of any desire she entertained to the essential air of having overmuch on her mind the felicity and indeed the very conduct and credit of the feast he knew as well the other things of which her appearance was at any time and in eaton square especially made up her resemblance to her father at times so vivid and coming out in the delicate warmth of occasions like the quickened fragrance of a flower her resemblance as he had hit it off for her once in rome in the first flushed days after their engagement to a little dancing girl at rest ever so light of movement but most often panting gently even a shade compunctiously on a bench her approximation finally for it was analogy somehow more than identity to the transmitted images of rather neutral and negative propriety that made up in his long line the average of wifehood and motherhood if the roman matron had been in sufficiency first and last the honour of that line maggie would no doubt at fifty have expanded have solidified to some such dignity even should she suggest a little but a cornelia in miniature a light however broke for him in season and when once it had done so it made him more than ever aware of mrs verver s vaguely yet quite exquisitely contingent participation a mere hinted or tendered discretion in short of mrs verver s indescribable unfathomable relation to the scene her placed condition her natural seat and neighbourhood her intenser presence her quieter smile her fewer jewels were inevitably all as nothing compared with the preoccupation that burned in maggie like a small flame and that had in fact kindled in each of her cheeks a little attesting but fortunately by no means unbecoming spot the party was her father s party and its greater or smaller success was a question having for her all the importance of his importance so that sympathy created for her a sort of visible suspense under pressure of which she bristled with filial reference with little filial recalls of expression movement tone it was all unmistakable and as pretty as possible if one would and even as funny but it put the pair so together as undivided by the marriage of each that the princess il n y avait pas a dire might sit where she liked she would still always in that house be irremediably maggie verver the prince found himself on this occasion so beset with that perception that its natural complement for him would really have been to wonder if mr verver had produced on people something of the same impression in the recorded cases of his having dined with his daughter this backward speculation had it begun to play however would have been easily arrested for it was at present to come over amerigo as never before that his remarkable father in law was the man in the world least equipped with different appearances for different hours he was simple he was a revelation of simplicity and that was the end of him so far as he consisted of an appearance at all a question that might verily for a weakness in it have been argued it amused our young man who was taking his pleasure to night it will be seen in sundry occult ways it amused him to feel how everything else the master of the house consisted of resources possessions facilities and amiabilities amplified by the social legend depended for conveying the effect of quantity on no personal equation no mere measurable medium quantity was in the air for these good people and mr verver s estimable quality was almost wholly in that pervasion he was meagre and modest and clearbrowed and his eyes if they wandered without fear yet stayed without defiance his shoulders were not broad his chest was not high his complexion was not fresh and the crown of his head was not covered in spite of all of which he looked at the top of his table so nearly like a little boy shyly entertaining in virtue of some imposed rank that he could only be one of the powers the representative of a force quite as an infant king is the representative of a dynasty in this generalised view of his father in law intensified to night but always operative amerigo had now for some time taken refuge the refuge after the reunion of the two households in england had more and more offered itself as the substitute for communities from man to man that by his original calculation might have become possible but that had not really ripened and flowered he met the decent family eyes across the table met them afterwards in the music room but only to read in them still what he had learned to read during his first months the time of over anxious initiation a kind of apprehension in which the terms and conditions were finally fixed and absolute this directed regard rested at its ease but it neither lingered nor penetrated and was to the prince s fancy much of the same order as any glance directed for due attention from the same quarter to the figure of a cheque received in the course of business and about to be enclosed to a banker it made sure of the amount and just so from time to time the amount of the prince was made sure he was being thus in renewed instalments perpetually paid in he already reposed in the bank as a value but subject in this comfortable way to repeated to infinite endorsement the net result of all of which moreover was that the young man had no wish to see his value diminish he himself after all had not fixed it the figure was a conception all of mr verver s own certainly however everything must be kept up to it never so much as to night had the prince felt this he would have been uncomfortable as these quiet expressions passed had the case not been guaranteed for him by the intensity of his accord with charlotte it was impossible that he should not now and again meet charlotte s eyes as it was also visible that she too now and again met her husband s for her as well in all his pulses he felt the conveyed impression it put them it kept them together through the vain show of their separation made the two other faces made the whole lapse of the evening the people the lights the flowers the pretended talk the exquisite music a mystic golden bridge between them strongly swaying and sometimes almost vertiginous for that intimacy of which the sovereign law would be the vigilance of care would be never rashly to forget and never consciously to wound xx the main interest of these hours for us however will have been in the way the prince continued to know during a particular succession of others separated from the evening in eaton square by a short interval a certain persistent aftertaste this was the lingering savour of a cup presented to him by fanny assingham s hand after dinner while the clustered quartette kept their ranged companions in the music room moved if one would but conveniently motionless mrs assingham contrived after a couple of pieces to convey to her friend that for her part she was moved by the genius of brahms beyond what she could bear so that without apparent deliberation she had presently floated away at the young man s side to such a distance as permitted them to converse without the effect of disdain it was the twenty minutes enjoyed with her during the rest of the concert in the less associated electric glare of one of the empty rooms it was their achieved and as he would have said successful most pleasantly successful talk on one of the sequestered sofas it was this that was substantially to underlie his consciousness of the later occasion the later occasion then mere matter of discussion had formed her ground for desiring in a light undertone into which his quick ear read indeed some nervousness these independent words with him she had sounded covertly but distinctly by the time they were seated together the great question of what it might involve it had come out for him before anything else and so abruptly that this almost needed an explanation then the abruptness itself had appeared to explain which had introduced in turn a slight awkwardness do you know that they re not after all going to matcham so that if they don t if at least maggie doesn t you won t i suppose go by yourself it was as i say at matcham where the event had placed him it was at matcham during the easter days that it most befell him oddly enough to live over inwardly for its wealth of special significance this passage by which the event had been really a good deal determined he had paid first and last many an english country visit he had learned even from of old to do the english things and to do them all sufficiently in the english way if he didn t always enjoy them madly he enjoyed them at any rate as much to an appearance as the good people who had in the night of time unanimously invented them and who still in the prolonged afternoon of their good faith unanimously even if a trifle automatically practised them yet with it all he had never so much as during such sojourns the trick of a certain detached the amusement of a certain inward critical life the determined need which apparently all participant of returning upon itself of backing noiselessly in far in again and rejoining there as it were that part of his mind that was not engaged at the front his body very constantly was engaged at the front in shooting in riding in golfing in walking over the fine diagonals of meadow paths or round the pocketed corners of billiard tables it sufficiently on the whole in fact bore the brunt of bridge playing of breakfasting lunching tea drinking dining and of the nightly climax over the bottigliera as he called it of the bristling tray it met finally to the extent of the limited tax on lip on gesture on wit most of the current demands of conversation and expression therefore something of him he often felt at these times was left out it was much more when he was alone or when he was with his own people or when he was say with mrs verver and nobody else that he moved that he talked that he listened that he felt as a congruous whole english society as he would have said cut him accordingly in two and he reminded himself often in his relations with it of a man possessed of a shining star a decoration an order of some sort something so ornamental as to make his identity not complete ideally without it yet who finding no other such object generally worn should be perpetually and the least bit ruefully unpinning it from his breast to transfer it to his pocket the prince s shining star may no doubt having been nothing more precious than his private subtlety but whatever the object was he just now fingered it a good deal out of sight amounting as it mainly did for him to a restless play of memory and a fine embroidery of thought something had rather momentously occurred in eaton square during his enjoyed minutes with his old friend his present perspective made definitely clear to him that she had plumped out for him her first little lie that took on and he could scarce have said why a sharpness of importance she had never lied to him before if only because it had never come up for her properly intelligibly morally that she must as soon as she had put to him the question of what he would do by which she meant of what charlotte would also do in that event of maggie s and mr verver s not embracing the proposal they had appeared for a day or two resignedly to entertain as soon as she had betrayed her curiosity as to the line the other pair so left to themselves might take a desire to avoid the appearance of at all too directly prying had become marked in her betrayed by the solicitude of which she had already three weeks before given him a view she had been obliged on a second thought to name intelligibly a reason for her appeal while the prince on his side had had not without mercy his glimpse of her momentarily groping for one and yet remaining unprovided not without mercy because absolutely he had on the spot in his friendliness invented one for her use presenting it to her with a look no more significant than if he had picked up to hand back to her a dropped flower you ask if i m likely also to back out then because it may make a difference in what you and the colonel decide he had gone as far as that for her fairly inviting her to assent though not having had his impression from any indication offered him by charlotte that the assinghams were really in question for the large matcham party the wonderful thing after this was that the active couple had in the interval managed to inscribe themselves on the golden roll an exertion of a sort that to do her justice he had never before observed fanny to make this last passage of the chapter but proved after all with what success she could work when she would once launched himself at any rate as he had been directed by all the terms of the intercourse between portland place and eaton square once steeped at matcham in the enjoyment of a splendid hospitality he found everything for his interpretation for his convenience fall easily enough into place and all the more that mrs verver was at hand to exchange ideas and impressions with the great house was full of people of possible new combinations of the quickened play of possible propinquity and no appearance of course was less to be cultivated than that of his having sought an opportunity to foregather with his friend at a safe distance from their respective sposi there was a happy boldness at the best in their mingling thus each unaccompanied in the same sustained sociability just exactly a touch of that eccentricity of associated freedom which sat so lightly on the imagination of the relatives left behind they were exposed as much as one would to its being pronounced funny that they should at such a rate go about together though on the other hand this consideration drew relief from the fact that in their high conditions and with the easy tradition the almost inspiring allowances of the house in question no individual line however freely marked was pronounced anything more than funny both our friends felt afresh as they had felt before the convenience of a society so placed that it had only its own sensibility to consider looking as it did well over the heads of all lower growths and that moreover treated its own sensibility quite as the easiest friendliest most informal and domesticated party to the general alliance what anyone thought of anyone else above all of anyone else with anyone else was a matter incurring in these lulls so little awkward formulation that hovering judgment the spirit with the scales might perfectly have been imaged there as some rather snubbed and subdued but quite trained and tactful poor relation of equal of the properest lineage only of aspect a little dingy doubtless from too limited a change of dress for whose tacit and abstemious presence never betrayed by a rattle of her rusty machine a room in the attic and a plate at the side table were decently usual it was amusing in such lightness of air that the prince should again present himself only to speak for the princess so unfortunately unable again to leave home and that mrs verver should as regularly figure as an embodied a beautifully deprecating apology for her husband who was all geniality and humility among his own treasures but as to whom the legend had grown up that he couldn t bear with the height of his standards and the tone of the company in the way of sofas and cabinets habitually kept by him the irritation and depression to which promiscuous visiting even at pompous houses had been found to expose him that was all right the noted working harmony of the clever son in law and the charming stepmother so long as the relation was for the effect in question maintained at the proper point between sufficiency and excess what with the noble fairness of the place meanwhile the generous mood of the sunny gusty lusty english april all panting and heaving with impatience or kicking and crying even at moments like some infant hercules who wouldn t be dressed what with these things and the bravery of youth and beauty the insolence of fortune and appetite so diffused among his fellow guests that the poor assinghams in their comparatively marked maturity and their comparatively small splendour were the only approach to a false note in the concert the stir of the air was such for going in a degree to one s head that as a mere matter of exposure almost grotesque in its flagrancy his situation resembled some elaborate practical joke carried out at his expense every voice in the great bright house was a call to the ingenuities and impunities of pleasure every echo was a defiance of difficulty doubt or danger every aspect of the picture a glowing plea for the immediate and as with plenty more to come was another phase of the spell for a world so constituted was governed by a spell that of the smile of the gods and the favour of the powers the only handsome the only gallant in fact the only intelligent acceptance of which was a faith in its guarantees and a high spirit for its chances its demand to that the thing came back was above all for courage and good humour and the value of this as a general assurance that is for seeing one through at the worst had not even in the easiest hours of his old roman life struck the prince so convincingly his old roman life had had more poetry no doubt but as he looked back upon it now it seemed to hang in the air of mere iridescent horizons to have been loose and vague and thin with large languorous unaccountable blanks the present order as it spread about him had somehow the ground under its feet and a trumpet in its ears and a bottomless bag of solid shining british sovereigns which was much to the point in its hand courage and good humour therefore were the breath of the day though for ourselves at least it would have been also much to the point that with amerigo really the innermost effect of all this perceptive ease was perhaps a strange final irritation he compared the lucid result with the extraordinary substitute for perception that presided in the bosom of his wife at so contented a view of his conduct and course a state of mind that was positively like a vicarious good conscience cultivated ingeniously on his behalf a perversity of pressure innocently persisted in and this wonder of irony became on occasion too intense to be kept wholly to himself it wasn t that at matcham anything particular anything monstrous anything that had to be noticed permitted itself as they said to happen there were only odd moments when the breath of the day as it has been called struck him so full in the face that he broke out with all the hilarity of what indeed would they have made of it they were of course maggie and her father moping so far as they ever consented to mope in monotonous eaton square but placid too in the belief that they knew beautifully what their expert companions were in for they knew it might have appeared in these lights absolutely nothing on earth worth speaking of whether beautifully or cynically and they would perhaps sometimes be a little less trying if they would only once for all peacefully admit that knowledge wasn t one of their needs and that they were in fact constitutionally inaccessible to it they were good children bless their hearts and the children of good children so that verily the principino himself as less consistently of that descent might figure to the fancy as the ripest genius of the trio the difficulty was for the nerves of daily intercourse with maggie in particular that her imagination was clearly never ruffled by the sense of any anomaly the great anomaly would have been that her husband or even that her father s wife should prove to have been made for the long run after the pattern set from so far back to the ververs if one was so made one had certainly no business on any terms at matcham whereas if one wasn t one had no business there on the particular terms terms of conformity with the principles of eaton square under which one had been so absurdly dedicated deep at the heart of that resurgent unrest in our young man which we have had to content ourselves with calling his irritation deep in the bosom of this falsity of position glowed the red spark of his inextinguishable sense of a higher and braver propriety there were situations that were ridiculous but that one couldn t yet help as for instance when one s wife chose in the most usual way to make one so precisely here however was the difference it had taken poor maggie to invent a way so extremely unusual yet to which none the less it would be too absurd that he should merely lend himself being thrust systematically with another woman and a woman one happened by the same token exceedingly to like and being so thrust that the theory of it seemed to publish one as idiotic or incapable this was a predicament of which the dignity depended all on one s own handling what was supremely grotesque in fact was the essential opposition of theories as if a galantuomo as he at least constitutionally conceived galantuomini could do anything but blush to go about at such a rate with such a person as mrs verver in a state of childlike innocence the state of our primitive parents before the fall the grotesque theory as he would have called it was perhaps an odd one to resent with violence and he did it also as a man of the world all merciful justice but assuredly none the less there was but one way really to mark and for his companion as much as for himself the commiseration in which they held it adequate comment on it could only be private but it could also at least be active and of rich and effectual comment charlotte and he were fortunately alike capable wasn t this consensus literally their only way not to be ungracious it was positively as if the measure of their escape from that danger were given by the growth between them during their auspicious visit of an exquisite sense of complicity xxi he found himself therefore saying with gaiety even to fanny assingham for their common concerned glance at eaton square the glance that was so markedly never as it might have been a glance at portland place what would our cari sposi have made of it here what would they you know really which overflow would have been reckless if already and surprisingly perhaps even to himself he had not got used to thinking of this friend as a person in whom the element of protest had of late been unmistakably allayed he exposed himself of course to her replying ah if it would have been so bad for them how can it be so good for you but quite apart from the small sense the question would have had at the best she appeared already to unite with him in confidence and cheer he had his view as well or at least a partial one of the inner spring of this present comparative humility which was all consistent with the retraction he had practically seen her make after mr verver s last dinner without diplomatising to do so with no effort to square her none to bribe her to an attitude for which he would have had no use in her if it were not sincere he yet felt how he both held her and moved her by the felicity of his taking pity all instinctively on her just discernible depression by just so much as he guessed that she felt herself as the slang was out of it out of the crystal current and the expensive picture by just so much had his friendship charmingly made up to her from hour to hour for the penalties as they might have been grossly called of her mistake her mistake had only been after all in her wanting to seem to him straight she had let herself in for being as she had made haste for that matter during the very first half hour at tea to proclaim herself the sole and single frump of the party the scale of everything was so different that all her minor values her quainter graces her little local authority her humour and her wardrobe alike for which it was enough elsewhere among her bons amis that they were hers dear fanny assingham s these matters and others would be all now as nought five minutes had sufficed to give her the fatal pitch in cadogan place she could always at the worst be picturesque for she habitually spoke of herself as local to sloane street whereas at matcham she should never be anything but horrible and it all would have come the disaster from the real refinement in her of the spirit of friendship to prove to him that she wasn t really watching him ground for which would have been too terribly grave she had followed him in his pursuit of pleasure so she might precisely mark her detachment this was handsome trouble for her to take the prince could see it all it wasn t a shade of interference that a good natured man would visit on her so he didn t even say when she told him how frumpy she knew herself how frumpy her very maid odiously going back on her rubbed it into her night and morning with unsealed eyes and lips that she now knew her he didn t then say ah see what you ve done isn t it rather your own fault he behaved differently altogether eminently distinguished himself for she told him she had never seen him so universally distinguished he yet distinguished her in her obscurity or in what was worse her objective absurdity and frankly invested her with her absolute value surrounded her with all the importance of her wit that wit as discriminated from stature and complexion a sense for bridge and a credit for pearls could have importance was meanwhile but dimly perceived at matcham so that his niceness to her she called it only niceness but it brought tears into her eyes had the greatness of a general as well as of a special demonstration she understands he said as a comment on all this to mrs verver she understands all she needs to understand she has taken her time but she has at last made it out for herself she sees how all we can desire is to give them the life they prefer to surround them with the peace and quiet and above all with the sense of security most favourable to it she can t of course very well put it to us that we have so far as she is concerned but to make the best of our circumstances she can t say in so many words don t think of me for i too must make the best of mine arrange as you can only and live as you must i don t get quite that from her any more than i ask for it but her tone and her whole manner mean nothing at all unless they mean that she trusts us to take as watchful to take as artful to take as tender care in our way as she so anxiously takes in hers so that she s well the prince wound up what you may call practically all right charlotte in fact however to help out his confidence didn t call it anything return as he might to the lucidity the importance or whatever it was of this lesson she gave him no aid toward reading it aloud she let him two or three times over spell it out for himself only on the eve of their visit s end was she for once clear or direct in response they had found a minute together in the great hall of the house during the half hour before dinner this easiest of chances they had already a couple of times arrived at by waiting persistently till the last other loiterers had gone to dress and by being prepared themselves to dress so expeditiously that they might a little later on be among the first to appear in festal array the hall then was empty before the army of rearranging cushion patting housemaids were marshalled in and there was a place by the forsaken fire at one end where they might imitate with art the unpremeditated above all here for the snatched instants they could breathe so near to each other that the interval was almost engulfed in it and the intensity both of the union and the caution became a workable substitute for contact they had prolongations of instants that counted as visions of bliss they had slow approximations that counted as long caresses the quality of these passages in truth made the spoken word and especially the spoken word about other people fall below them so that our young woman s tone had even now a certain dryness it s very good of her my dear to trust us but what else can she do why whatever people do when they don t trust let one see they don t but let whom see well let me say to begin with and should you mind that he had a slight show of surprise shouldn t you her letting you see no said charlotte the only thing i can imagine myself minding is what you yourself if you don t look out may let her see to which she added you may let her see you know that you re afraid i m only afraid of you a little at moments he presently returned but i shan t let fanny see that it was clear however that neither the limits nor the extent of mrs assingham s vision were now a real concern to her and she gave expression to this as she had not even yet done what in the world can she do against us there s not a word that she can breathe she s helpless she can t speak she would be herself the first to be dished by it and then as he seemed slow to follow it all comes back to her it all began with her everything from the first she introduced you to maggie she made your marriage the prince might have had his moment of demur but at this after a little as with a smile dim but deep he came on mayn t she also be said a good deal to have made yours that was intended i think wasn t it for a kind of rectification charlotte on her side for an instant hesitated then she was prompter still i don t mean there was anything to rectify everything was as it had to be and i m not speaking of how she may have been concerned for you and me i m speaking of how she took in her way each time their lives in hand and how therefore that ties her up to day she can t go to them and say it s very awkward of course you poor dear things but i was frivolously mistaken he took it in still with his long look at her all the more that she wasn t she was right everything s right he went on and everything will stay so then that s all i say but he worked it out for the deeper satisfaction even to superfluous lucidity we re happy and they re happy what more does the position admit of what more need fanny assingham want ah my dear said charlotte it s not i who say that she need want anything i only say that she s fixed that she must stand exactly where everything has by her own act placed her it s you who have seemed haunted with the possibility for her of some injurious alternative something or other we must be prepared for and she had with her high reasoning a strange cold smile we are prepared for anything for everything and as we are practically so she must take us she s condemned to consistency she s doomed poor thing to a genial optimism that luckily for her however is very much the law of her nature she was born to soothe and to smooth now then therefore mrs verver gently laughed she has the chance of her life so that her present professions may even at the best not be sincere may be but a mask for doubts and fears and for gaining time the prince had looked with the question as if this again could trouble him and it determined in his companion a slight impatience you keep talking about such things as if they were our affair at all i feel at any rate that i ve nothing to do with her doubts and fears or with anything she may feel she must arrange all that for herself it s enough for me that she ll always be of necessity much more afraid for herself really either to see or to speak than we should be to have her do it even if we were the idiots and cowards we aren t and charlotte s face with these words to the mitigation of the slightly hard ring there might otherwise have been in them fairly lightened softened shone out it reflected as really never yet the rare felicity of their luck it made her look for the moment as if she had actually pronounced that word of unpermitted presumption so apt is the countenance as with a finer consciousness than the tongue to betray a sense of this particular lapse she might indeed the next instant have seen her friend wince in advance at her use of a word that was already on her lips for it was still unmistakable with him that there were things he could prize forms of fortune he could cherish without at all proportionately liking their names had all this however been even completely present to his companion what other term could she have applied to the strongest and simplest of her ideas but the one that exactly fitted it she applied it then though her own instinct moved her at the same time to pay her tribute to the good taste from which they hadn t heretofore by a hair s breadth deviated if it didn t sound so vulgar i should say that we re fatally as it were safe pardon the low expression since it s what we happen to be we re so because they are and they re so because they can t be anything else from the moment that having originally intervened for them she wouldn t now be able to bear herself if she didn t keep them so that s the way she s inevitably with us said charlotte over her smile we hang essentially together well the prince candidly allowed she did bring it home to him every way it worked out yes i see we hang essentially together his friend had a shrug a shrug that had a grace cosa volete the effect beautifully nobly was more than roman ah beyond doubt it s a case he stood looking at her it s a case there can t he said have been many perhaps never never never any other that she smiled i confess i should like to think only ours only ours most probably speriamo to which as after hushed connections he presently added poor fanny but charlotte had already with a start and a warning hand turned from a glance at the clock she sailed away to dress while he watched her reach the staircase his eyes followed her till with a simple swift look round at him she vanished something in the sight however appeared to have renewed the spring of his last exclamation which he breathed again upon the air poor poor fanny it was to prove however on the morrow quite consistent with the spirit of these words that the party at matcham breaking up and multitudinously dispersing he should be able to meet the question of the social side of the process of repatriation with due presence of mind it was impossible for reasons that he should travel to town with the assinghams it was impossible for the same reasons that he should travel to town save in the conditions that he had for the last twenty four hours been privately and it might have been said profoundly thinking out the result of his thought was already precious to him and this put at his service he sufficiently believed the right tone for disposing of his elder friend s suggestion an assumption in fact equally full and mild that he and charlotte would conveniently take the same train and occupy the same compartment as the colonel and herself the extension of the idea to mrs verver had been precisely a part of mrs assingham s mildness and nothing could better have characterised her sense for social shades than her easy perception that the gentleman from portland place and the lady from eaton square might now confess quite without indiscretion to simultaneity of movement she had made for the four days no direct appeal to the latter personage but the prince was accidental witness of her taking a fresh start at the moment the company were about to scatter for the last night of their stay there had been at this climax the usual preparatory talk about hours and combinations in the midst of which poor fanny gently approached mrs verver she said you and the prince love quite apparently without blinking she took for granted their public withdrawal together she remarked that she and bob were alike ready in the interest of sociability to take any train that would make them all one party i feel really as if all this time i had seen nothing of you that gave an added grace to the candour of the dear thing s approach but just then it was on the other hand that the young man found himself borrow most effectively the secret of the right tone for doing as he preferred his preference had during the evening not failed of occasion to press him with mute insistences practically without words without any sort of straight telegraphy it had arrived at a felt identity with charlotte s own she spoke all for their friend while she answered their friend s question but she none the less signalled to him as definitely as if she had fluttered a white handkerchief from a window it s awfully sweet of you darling our going together would be charming but you mustn t mind us you must suit yourselves we ve settled amerigo and i to stay over till after luncheon amerigo with the chink of this gold in his ear turned straight away so as not to be instantly appealed to and for the very emotion of the wonder furthermore of what divination may achieve when winged by a community of passion charlotte had uttered the exact plea that he had been keeping ready for the same foreseen necessity and had uttered it simply as a consequence of their deepening unexpressed need of each other and without the passing between them of a word he hadn t god knew to take it from her he was too conscious of what he wanted but the lesson for him was in the straight clear tone that charlotte could thus distil in the perfect felicity of her adding no explanation no touch for plausibility that she wasn t strictly obliged to add and in the truly superior way in which women so situated express and distinguish themselves she had answered mrs assingham quite adequately she had not spoiled it by a reason a scrap larger than the smallest that would serve and she had above all thrown off for his stretched but covered attention an image that flashed like a mirror played at the face of the sun the measure of everything to all his sense at these moments was in it the measure especially of the thought that had been growing with him a positive obsession and that began to throb as never yet under this brush of her having by perfect parity of imagination the match for it his whole consciousness had by this time begun almost to ache with a truth of an exquisite order at the glow of which she too had so unmistakably then been warming herself the truth that the occasion constituted by the last few days couldn t possibly save by some poverty of their own refuse them some still other and still greater beauty it had already told them with an hourly voice that it had a meaning a meaning that their associated sense was to drain even as thirsty lips after the plough through the sands and the sight afar of the palm cluster might drink in at last the promised well in the desert there had been beauty day after day and there had been for the spiritual lips something of the pervasive taste of it yet it was all none the less as if their response had remained below their fortune how to bring it by some brave free lift up to the same height was the idea with which behind and beneath everything he was restlessly occupied and in the exploration of which as in that of the sun chequered greenwood of romance his spirit thus at the opening of a vista met hers they were already from that moment so hand in hand in the place that he found himself making use five minutes later of exactly the same tone as charlotte s for telling mrs assingham that he was likewise in the matter of the return to london sorry for what mightn t be this had become of a sudden the simplest thing in the world the sense of which moreover seemed really to amount to a portent that he should feel forevermore on the general head conveniently at his ease with her he went in fact a step further than charlotte put the latter forward as creating his necessity she was staying over luncheon to oblige their hostess as a consequence of which he must also stay to see her decently home he must deliver her safe and sound he felt in eaton square regret as he might too the difference made by this obligation he frankly didn t mind inasmuch as over and above the pleasure itself his scruple would certainly gratify both mr verver and maggie they never yet had absolutely and entirely learned he even found deliberation to intimate how little he really neglected the first as it seemed nowadays quite to have become of his domestic duties therefore he still constantly felt how little he must remit his effort to make them remark it to which he added with equal lucidity that they would return in time for dinner and if he didn t as a last word subjoin that it would be lovely of fanny to find on her own return a moment to go to eaton square and report them as struggling bravely on this was not because the impulse down to the very name for the amiable act altogether failed to rise his inward assurance his general plan had at moments where she was concerned its drops of continuity and nothing would less have pleased him than that she should suspect in him however tempted any element of conscious cheek but he was always that was really the upshot cultivating thanklessly the considerate and the delicate it was a long lesson this unlearning with people of english race all the little superstitions that accompany friendship mrs assingham herself was the first to say that she would unfailingly report she brought it out in fact he thought quite wonderfully having attained the summit of the wonderful during the brief interval that had separated her appeal to charlotte from this passage with himself she had taken the five minutes obviously amid the rest of the talk and the movement to retire into her tent for meditation which showed among several things the impression charlotte had made on her it was from the tent she emerged as with arms refurbished though who indeed could say if the manner in which she now met him spoke most really of the glitter of battle or of the white waver of the flag of truce the parley was short either way the gallantry of her offer was all sufficient i ll go to our friends then i ll ask for luncheon i ll tell them when to expect you that will be charming say we re all right all right precisely i can t say more mrs assingham smiled no doubt but he considered as for the possible importance of it neither can you by what i seem to feel say less oh i won t say less fanny laughed with which the next moment she had turned away but they had it again not less bravely on the morrow after breakfast in the thick of the advancing carriages and the exchange of farewells i think i ll send home my maid from euston she was then prepared to amend and go to eaton square straight so you can be easy oh i think we re easy the prince returned be sure to say at any rate that we re bearing up you re bearing up good and charlotte returns to dinner to dinner we re not likely i think to make another night away well then i wish you at least a pleasant day oh he laughed as they separated we shall do our best for it after which in due course with the announcement of their conveyance the assinghams rolled off xxii it was quite for the prince after this as if the view had further cleared so that the half hour during which he strolled on the terrace and smoked the day being lovely overflowed with the plenitude of its particular quality its general brightness was composed doubtless of many elements but what shone out of it as if the whole place and time had been a great picture from the hand of genius presented to him as a prime ornament for his collection and all varnished and framed to hang up what marked it especially for the highest appreciation was his extraordinarily unchallenged his absolutely appointed and enhanced possession of it poor fanny assingham s challenge amounted to nothing one of the things he thought of while he leaned on the old marble balustrade so like others that he knew in still more nobly terraced italy was that she was squared all conveniently even to herself and that rumbling toward london with this contentment she had become an image irrelevant to the scene it further passed across him as his imagination was for reasons during the time unprecedentedly active that he had after all gained more from women than he had ever lost by them there appeared so more and more on those mystic books that are kept in connection with such commerce even by men of the loosest business habits a balance in his favour that he could pretty well as a rule take for granted what were they doing at this very moment wonderful creatures but combine and conspire for his advantage from maggie herself most wonderful in her way of all to his hostess of the present hour into whose head it had so inevitably come to keep charlotte on for reasons of her own and who had asked in this benevolent spirit why in the world if not obliged without plausibility to hurry her husband s son in law should not wait over in her company he would at least see lady castledean had said that nothing dreadful should happen to her either while still there or during the exposure of the run to town and for that matter if they exceeded a little their license it would positively help them to have done so together each of them would in this way at home have the other comfortably to blame all of which besides in lady castledean as in maggie in fanny assingham as in charlotte herself was working for him without provocation or pressure by the mere play of some vague sense on their part definite and conscious at the most only in charlotte that he was not as a nature as a character as a gentleman in fine below his remarkable fortune but there were more things before him than even these things that melted together almost indistinguishably to feed his sense of beauty if the outlook was in every way spacious and the towers of three cathedrals in different counties as had been pointed out to him gleamed discernibly like dim silver in the rich sameness of tone didn t he somehow the more feel it so because precisely lady castledean had kept over a man of her own and that this offered a certain sweet intelligibility as the note of the day it made everything fit above all it diverted him to the extent of keeping up while he lingered and waited his meditative smile she had detained charlotte because she wished to detain mr blint and she couldn t detain mr blint disposed though he clearly was to oblige her without spreading over the act some ampler drapery castledean had gone up to london the place was all her own she had had a fancy for a quiet morning with mr blint a sleek civil accomplished young man distinctly younger than her ladyship who played and sang delightfully played even bridge and sang the english comic as well as the french tragic and the presence which really meant the absence of a couple of other friends if they were happily chosen would make everything all right the prince had the sense all good humouredly of being happily chosen and it was not spoiled for him even by another sense that followed in its train and with which during his life in england he had more than once had reflectively to deal the state of being reminded how after all as an outsider a foreigner and even as a mere representative husband and son in law he was so irrelevant to the working of affairs that he could be bent on occasion to uses comparatively trivial no other of her guests would have been thus convenient for their hostess affairs of whatever sorts had claimed by early trains every active easy smoothly working man each in his way a lubricated item of the great social political administrative engrenage claimed most of all castledean himself who was so very oddly given the personage and the type rather a large item if he on the other hand had an affair it was not of that order it was of the order verily that he had been reduced to as a not quite glorious substitute it marked however the feeling of the hour with him that this vision of being reduced interfered not at all with the measure of his actual ease it kept before him again at moments the so familiar fact of his sacrifices down to the idea of the very relinquishment for his wife s convenience of his real situation in the world with the consequence thus that he was in the last analysis among all these so often inferior people practically held cheap and made light of but though all this was sensible enough there was a spirit in him that could rise above it a spirit that positively played with the facts with all of them from that of the droll ambiguity of english relations to that of his having in mind something quite beautiful and independent and harmonious something wholly his own he couldn t somehow take mr blint seriously he was much more an outsider by the larger scale even than a roman prince who consented to be in abeyance yet it was past finding out either how such a woman as lady castledean could take him since this question but sank for him again into the fathomless depths of english equivocation he knew them all as was said well he had lived with them stayed with them dined hunted shot and done various other things with them but the number of questions about them he couldn t have answered had much rather grown than shrunken so that experience struck him for the most part as having left in him but one residual impression they didn t like les situations nettes that was all he was very sure of they wouldn t have them at any price it had been their national genius and their national success to avoid them at every point they called it themselves with complacency their wonderful spirit of compromise the very influence of which actually so hung about him here from moment to moment that the earth and the air the light and the colour the fields and the hills and the sky the blue green counties and the cold cathedrals owed to it every accent of their tone verily as one had to feel in presence of such a picture it had succeeded it had made up to now for that seated solidity in the rich sea mist on which the garish the supposedly envious peoples have ever cooled their eyes but it was at the same time precisely why even much initiation left one at given moments so puzzled as to the element of staleness in all the freshness and of freshness in all the staleness of innocence in the guilt and of guilt in the innocence there were other marble terraces sweeping more purple prospects on which he would have known what to think and would have enjoyed thereby at least the small intellectual fillip of a discerned relation between a given appearance and a taken meaning the inquiring mind in these present conditions might it was true be more sharply challenged but the result of its attention and its ingenuity it had unluckily learned to know was too often to be confronted with a mere dead wall a lapse of logic a confirmed bewilderment and moreover above all nothing mattered in the relation of the enclosing scene to his own consciousness but its very most direct bearings lady castledean s dream of mr blint for the morning was doubtless already with all the spacious harmonies re established taking the form of going over something with him at the piano in one of the numerous smaller rooms that were consecrated to the less gregarious uses what she had wished had been effected her convenience had been assured this made him however wonder the more where charlotte was since he didn t at all suppose her to be making a tactless third which would be to have accepted mere spectatorship in the duet of their companions the upshot of everything for him alike of the less and of the more was that the exquisite day bloomed there like a large fragrant flower that he had only to gather but it was to charlotte he wished to make the offering and as he moved along the terrace which rendered visible parts of two sides of the house he looked up at all the windows that were open to the april morning and wondered which of them would represent his friend s room it befell thus that his question after no long time was answered he saw charlotte appear above as if she had been called by the pausing of his feet on the flags she had come to the sill on which she leaned to look down and she remained there a minute smiling at him he had been immediately struck with her wearing a hat and a jacket which conduced to her appearance of readiness not so much to join him with a beautiful uncovered head and a parasol where he stood as to take with him some larger step altogether the larger step had been since the evening before intensely in his own mind though he had not fully thought out even yet the slightly difficult detail of it but he had had no chance such as he needed to speak the definite word to her and the face she now showed affected him accordingly as a notice that she had wonderfully guessed it for herself they had these identities of impulse they had had them repeatedly before and if such unarranged but unerring encounters gave the measure of the degree in which people were in the common phrase meant for each other no union in the world had ever been more sweetened with rightness what in fact most often happened was that her rightness went as who should say even further than his own they were conscious of the same necessity at the same moment only it was she as a general thing who most clearly saw her way to it something in her long look at him now out of the old grey window something in the very poise of her hat the colour of her necktie the prolonged stillness of her smile touched into sudden light for him all the wealth of the fact that he could count on her he had his hand there to pluck it on the open bloom of the day but what did the bright minute mean but that her answering hand was already intelligently out so therefore while the minute lasted it passed between them that their cup was full which cup their very eyes holding it fast carried and steadied and began as they tasted it to praise he broke however after a moment the silence it only wants a moon a mandolin and a little danger to be a serenade ah then she lightly called down let it at least have this with which she detached a rich white rosebud from its company with another in the front of her dress and flung it down to him he caught it in its fall fixing her again after she had watched him place it in his buttonhole come down quickly he said in an italian not loud but deep vengo vengo she as clearly but more lightly tossed out and she had left him the next minute to wait for her he came along the terrace again with pauses during which his eyes rested as they had already often done on the brave darker wash of far away watercolour that represented the most distant of the cathedral towns this place with its great church and its high accessibility its towers that distinguishably signalled its english history its appealing type its acknowledged interest this place had sounded its name to him half the night through and its name had become but another name the pronounceable and convenient one for that supreme sense of things which now throbbed within him he had kept saying to himself gloucester gloucester gloucester quite as if the sharpest meaning of all the years just passed were intensely expressed in it that meaning was really that his situation remained quite sublimely consistent with itself and that they absolutely he and charlotte stood there together in the very lustre of this truth every present circumstance helped to proclaim it it was blown into their faces as by the lips of the morning he knew why from the first of his marriage he had tried with such patience for such conformity he knew why he had given up so much and bored himself so much he knew why he at any rate had gone in on the basis of all forms on the basis of his having in a manner sold himself for a situation nette it had all been just in order that his well what on earth should he call it but his freedom should at present be as perfect and rounded and lustrous as some huge precious pearl he hadn t struggled nor snatched he was taking but what had been given him the pearl dropped itself with its exquisite quality and rarity straight into his hand here precisely it was incarnate its size and its value grew as mrs verver appeared afar off in one of the smaller doorways she came toward him in silence while he moved to meet her the great scale of this particular front at matcham multiplied thus in the golden morning the stages of their meeting and the successions of their consciousness it wasn t till she had come quite close that he produced for her his gloucester gloucester gloucester and his look at it over there she knew just where to look yes isn t it one of the best there are cloisters or towers or some thing and her eyes which though her lips smiled were almost grave with their depths of acceptance came back to him or the tomb of some old king we must see the old king we must do the cathedral he said we must know all about it if we could but take he exhaled the full opportunity and then while for all they seemed to give him he sounded again her eyes i feel the day like a great gold cup that we must somehow drain together i feel it as you always make me feel everything just as you do so that i know ten miles off how you feel but do you remember she asked apropos of great gold cups the beautiful one the real one that i offered you so long ago and that you wouldn t have just before your marriage she brought it back to him the gilded crystal bowl in the little bloomsbury shop oh yes but it took with a slight surprise on the prince s part some small recollecting the treacherous cracked thing you wanted to palm off on me and the little swindling jew who understood italian and who backed you up but i feel this an occasion he immediately added and i hope you don t mean he smiled that as an occasion it s also cracked they spoke naturally more low than loud overlooked as they were though at a respectful distance by tiers of windows but it made each find in the other s voice a taste as of something slowly and deeply absorbed don t you think too much of cracks and aren t you too afraid of them i risk the cracks said charlotte and i ve often recalled the bowl and the little swindling jew wondering if they ve parted company he made she said a great impression on me well you also no doubt made a great impression on him and i dare say that if you were to go back to him you d find he has been keeping that treasure for you but as to cracks the prince went on what did you tell me the other day you prettily call them in english rifts within the lute risk them as much as you like for yourself but don t risk them for me he spoke it in all the gaiety of his just barely tremulous serenity i go as you know by my superstitions and that s why he said i know where we are they re every one to day on our side resting on the parapet toward the great view she was silent a little and he saw the next moment that her eyes were closed i go but by one thing her hand was on the sun warmed stone so that turned as they were away from the house he put his own upon it and covered it i go by you she said i go by you so they remained a moment till he spoke again with a gesture that matched what is really our great necessity you know is to go by my watch it s already eleven he had looked at the time so that if we stop here to luncheon what becomes of our afternoon to this charlotte s eyes opened straight there s not the slightest need of our stopping here to luncheon don t you see she asked how i m ready he had taken it in but there was always more and more of her you mean you ve arranged it s easy to arrange my maid goes up with my things you ve only to speak to your man about yours and they can go together you mean we can leave at once she let him have it all one of the carriages about which i spoke will already have come back for us if your superstitions are on our side she smiled so my arrangements are and i ll back my support against yours then you had thought he wondered about gloucester she hesitated but it was only her way i thought you would think we have thank goodness these harmonies they are food for superstition if you like it s beautiful she went on that it should be gloucester glo ster glo ster as you say making it sound like an old song however i m sure glo ster glo ster will be charming she still added we shall be able easily to lunch there and with our luggage and our servants off our hands we shall have at least three or four hours we can wire she wound up from there ever so quietly she had brought it as she had thought it all out and it had to be as covertly that he let his appreciation expand then lady castledean doesn t dream of our staying he took it but thinking yet then what does she dream of mr blint poor dear of mr blint only her smile for him for the prince himself was free have i positively to tell you that she doesn t want us she only wanted us for the others to show she wasn t left alone with him now that that s done and that they ve all gone she of course knows for herself knows the prince vaguely echoed why that we like cathedrals that we inevitably stop to see them or go round to take them in whenever we ve a chance that it s what our respective families quite expect of us and would be disappointed for us to fail of this as forestieri mrs verver pursued would be our pull if our pull weren t indeed so great all round he could only keep his eyes on her and have you made out the very train the very one paddington the in that gives us oceans we can dine at the usual hour at home and as maggie will of course be in eaton square i hereby invite you for a while he still but looked at her it was a minute before he spoke thank you very much with pleasure to which he in a moment added but the train for gloucester a local one with several stops but doing it a good deal i forget how much within the hour so that we ve time only she said we must employ our time he roused himself as from the mere momentary spell of her he looked again at his watch while they moved back to the door through which she had advanced but he had also again questions and stops all as for the mystery and the charm you looked it up without my having asked you ah my dear she laughed i ve seen you with bradshaw it takes anglo saxon blood blood he echoed you ve that of every race it kept her before him you re terrible well he could put it as he liked i know the name of the inn what is it then there are two you ll see but i ve chosen the right one and i think i remember the tomb she smiled oh the tomb any tomb would do for him but i mean i had been keeping my idea so cleverly for you while there you already were with it you had been keeping it for me as much as you like but how do you make out she asked that you were keeping it from me i don t now how shall i ever keep anything some day when i shall wish to ah for things i mayn t want to know i promise you shall find me stupid they had reached their door where she herself paused to explain these days yesterday last night this morning i ve wanted everything well it was all right you shall have everything xxiii fanny on her arrival in town carried out her second idea despatching the colonel to his club for luncheon and packing her maid into a cab for cadogan place with the variety of their effects the result of this for each of the pair was a state of occupation so unbroken that the day practically passed without fresh contact between them they dined out together but it was both in going to their dinner and in coming back that they appeared on either side to have least to communicate fanny was wrapped in her thoughts still more closely than in the lemon coloured mantle that protected her bare shoulders and her husband with her silence to deal with showed himself not less disposed than usual when so challenged to hold up as he would have said his end of it they had in general in these days longer pauses and more abrupt transitions in one of which latter they found themselves for a climax launched at midnight mrs assingham rather wearily housed again ascended to the first floor there to sink overburdened on the landing outside the drawing room into a great gilded venetian chair of which at first however she but made with her brooding face a sort of throne of meditation she would thus have recalled a little with her so free orientalism of type the immemorially speechless sphinx about at last to become articulate the colonel not unlike on his side some old pilgrim of the desert camping at the foot of that monument went by way of reconnoissance into the drawing room he visited according to his wont the windows and their fastenings he cast round the place the eye all at once of the master and the manager the commandant and the rate payer then he came back to his wife before whom for a moment he stood waiting but she herself for a time continued to wait only looking up at him inscrutably there was in these minor manoeuvres and conscious patiences something of a suspension of their old custom of divergent discussion that intercourse by misunderstanding which had grown so clumsy now this familiar pleasantry seemed to desire to show it could yield on occasion to any clear trouble though it was also sensibly and just incoherently in the air that no trouble was at present to be vulgarly recognised as clear there might for that matter even have been in mr assingham s face a mild perception of some finer sense a sense for his wife s situation and the very situation she was oddly enough about to repudiate that she had fairly caused to grow in him but it was a flower to breathe upon gently and this was very much what she finally did she knew he needed no telling that she had given herself all the afternoon to her friends in eaton square and that her doing so would have been but the prompt result of impressions gathered in quantities in brimming baskets like the purple grapes of the vintage at matcham a process surrounded by him while it so unmistakably went on with abstentions and discretions that might almost have counted as solemnities the solemnities at the same time had committed him to nothing to nothing beyond this confession itself of a consciousness of deep waters she had been out on these waters for him visibly and his tribute to the fact had been his keeping her even if without a word well in sight he had not quitted for an hour during her adventure the shore of the mystic lake he had on the contrary stationed himself where she could signal to him at need her need would have arisen if the planks of her bark had parted then some sort of plunge would have become his immediate duty his present position clearly was that of seeing her in the centre of her sheet of dark water and of wondering if her actual mute gaze at him didn t perhaps mean that her planks were now parting he held himself so ready that it was quite as if the inward man had pulled off coat and waistcoat before he had plunged however that is before he had uttered a question he perceived not without relief that she was making for land he watched her steadily paddle always a little nearer and at last he felt her boat bump the bump was distinct and in fact she stepped ashore we were all wrong there s nothing nothing it was like giving her his hand up the bank between charlotte verver and the prince i was uneasy but i m satisfied now i was in fact quite mistaken there s nothing but i thought said bob assingham that that was just what you did persistently asseverate you ve guaranteed their straightness from the first no i ve never till now guaranteed anything but my own disposition to worry i ve never till now fanny went on gravely from her chair had such a chance to see and to judge i had it at that place if i had in my infatuation and my folly she added with expression nothing else so i did see i have seen and now i know her emphasis as she repeated the word made her head in her seat of infallibility rise higher i know the colonel took it but took it at first in silence do you mean they ve told you no i mean nothing so absurd for in the first place i haven t asked them and in the second their word in such a matter wouldn t count oh said the colonel with all his oddity they d tell us it made her face him an instant as with her old impatience of his short cuts always across her finest flower beds but she felt none the less that she kept her irony down then when they ve told you you ll be perhaps so good as to let me know he jerked up his chin testing the growth of his beard with the back of his hand while he fixed her with a single eye ah i don t say that they d necessarily tell me that they are over the traces they ll necessarily whatever happens hold their tongues i hope and i m talking of them now as i take them for myself only that s enough for me it s all i have to regard with which after an instant they re wonderful said fanny assingham indeed her husband concurred i really think they are you d think it still more if you knew but you don t know because you don t see their situation this was what he didn t see is too extraordinary too he was willing to try too extraordinary to be believed i mean if one didn t see but just that in a way is what saves them they take it seriously he followed at his own pace their situation the incredible side of it they make it credible credible then you do say to you she looked at him again for an interval they believe in it themselves they take it for what it is and that she said saves them but if what it is is just their chance it s their chance for what i told you when charlotte first turned up it s their chance for the idea that i was then sure she had the colonel showed his effort to recall oh your idea at different moments of any one of their ideas this dim procession visibly mustered before him and with the best will in the world he could but watch its immensity are you speaking now of something to which you can comfortably settle down again for a little she only glowered at him i ve come back to my belief and that i have done so well he asked as she paused well shows that i m right for i assure you i had wandered far now i m at home again and i mean said fanny assingham to stay here they re beautiful she declared the prince and charlotte the prince and charlotte that s how they re so remarkable and the beauty she explained is that they re afraid for them afraid i mean for the others for mr verver and maggie it did take some following afraid of what afraid of themselves the colonel wondered of themselves of mr verver s and maggie s selves mrs assingham remained patient as well as lucid yes of such blindness too but most of all of their own danger he turned it over that danger being the blindness that danger being their position what their position contains of all the elements i needn t at this time of day attempt to tell you it contains luckily for that s the mercy everything but blindness i mean on their part the blindness said fanny is primarily her husband s he stood for a moment he would have it straight whose husband s mr verver s she went on the blindness is most of all his that they feel that they see but it s also his wife s whose wife s he asked as she continued to gloom at him in a manner at variance with the comparative cheer of her contention and then as she only gloomed the prince s maggie s own maggie s very own she pursued as for herself he had a pause do you think maggie so blind the question isn t of what i think the question s of the conviction that guides the prince and charlotte who have better opportunities than i for judging the colonel again wondered are you so very sure their opportunities are better well his wife asked what is their whole so extraordinary situation their extraordinary relation but an opportunity ah my dear you have that opportunity of their extraordinary situation and relation as much as they with the difference darling she returned with some spirit that neither of those matters are if you please mine i see the boat they re in but i m not thank god in it myself to day however mrs assingham added to day in eaton square i did see well then what but she mused over it still oh many things more somehow than ever before it was as if god help me i was seeing for them i mean for the others it was as if something had happened i don t know what except some effect of these days with them at that place that had either made things come out or had cleared my own eyes these eyes indeed of the poor lady s rested on her companion s meanwhile with the lustre not so much of intenser insight as of a particular portent that he had at various other times had occasion to recognise she desired obviously to reassure him but it apparently took a couple of large candid gathering glittering tears to emphasise the fact they had immediately for him their usual direct action she must reassure him he was made to feel absolutely in her own way he would adopt it and conform to it as soon as he should be able to make it out the only thing was that it took such incalculable twists and turns the twist seemed remarkable for instance as she developed her indication of what had come out in the afternoon it was as if i knew better than ever what makes them what makes them he pressed her as she fitfully dropped well makes the prince and charlotte take it all as they do it might well have been difficult to know how to take it and they may even say for themselves that they were a long time trying to see as i say to day she went on it was as if i were suddenly with a kind of horrible push seeing through their eyes on which as to shake off her perversity fanny assingham sprang up but she remained there under the dim illumination and while the colonel with his high dry spare look of type to which a certain conformity to the whiteness of inaccessible snows in his necktie shirt front and waistcoat gave a rigour of accent waited watching her they might at the late hour and in the still house have been a pair of specious worldly adventurers driven for relief under sudden stress to some grim midnight reckoning in an odd corner her attention moved mechanically over the objects of ornament disposed too freely on the walls of staircase and landing as to which recognition for the time had lost both fondness and compunction i can imagine the way it works she said it s so easy to understand yet i don t want to be wrong she the next moment broke out i don t i don t want to be wrong to make a mistake you mean oh no she meant nothing of the sort she knew but too well what she meant i don t make mistakes but i perpetrate in thought crimes and she spoke with all intensity i m a most dreadful person there are times when i seem not to mind a bit what i ve done or what i think or imagine or fear or accept when i feel that i d do it again feel that i d do things myself ah my dear the colonel remarked in the coolness of debate yes if you had driven me back on my nature luckily for you you never have you ve done every thing else but you ve never done that but what i really don t a bit want she declared is to abet them or to protect them her companion turned this over what is there to protect them from if by your now so settled faith they ve done nothing that justly exposes them and it in fact half pulled her up well from a sudden scare from the alarm i mean of what maggie may think yet if your whole idea is that maggie thinks nothing she waited again it isn t my whole idea nothing is my whole idea for i felt to day as i tell you that there s so much in the air oh in the air the colonel dryly breathed well what s in the air always has hasn t it to come down to the earth and maggie mrs assingham continued is a very curious little person since i was in this afternoon for seeing more than i had ever done well i felt that too for some reason as i hadn t yet felt it for some reason for what reason and then as his wife at first said nothing did she give any sign was she in any way different she s always so different from anyone else in the world that it s hard to say when she s different from herself but she has made me said fanny after an instant think of her differently she drove me home home here first to portland place on her leaving her father since she does once in a while leave him that was to keep me with her a little longer but she kept the carriage and after tea there came with me herself back here this was also for the same purpose then she went home though i had brought her a message from the prince that arranged their movements otherwise he and charlotte must have arrived if they have arrived expecting to drive together to eaton square and keep maggie on to dinner there she has everything there you know she has clothes the colonel didn t in fact know but he gave it his apprehension oh you mean a change twenty changes if you like all sorts of things she dresses really maggie does as much for her father and she always did as for her husband or for herself she has her room in his house very much as she had it before she was married and just as the boy has quite a second nursery there in which mrs noble when she comes with him makes herself i assure you at home si bien that if charlotte in her own house so to speak should wish a friend or two to stay with her she really would be scarce able to put them up it was a picture into which as a thrifty entertainer himself bob assingham could more or less enter maggie and the child spread so maggie and the child spread so well he considered it is rather rum that s all i claim she seemed thankful for the word i don t say it s anything more but it is distinctly rum which after an instant the colonel took up more what more could it be it could be that she s unhappy and that she takes her funny little way of consoling herself for if she were unhappy mrs assingham had figured it out that s just the way i m convinced she would take but how can she be unhappy since as i m also convinced she in the midst of everything adores her husband as much as ever the colonel at this brooded for a little at large then if she s so happy please what s the matter it made his wife almost spring at him you think then she s secretly wretched but he threw up his arms in deprecation ah my dear i give them up to you i ve nothing more to suggest then it s not sweet of you she spoke at present as if he were frequently sweet you admit that it is rum and this indeed fixed again for a moment his intention has charlotte complained of the want of rooms for her friends never that i know of a word it isn t the sort of thing she does and whom has she after all mrs assingham added to complain to hasn t she always you oh me charlotte and i nowadays she spoke as of a chapter closed yet see the justice i still do her she strikes me more and more as extraordinary a deeper shade at the renewal of the word had come into the colonel s face if they re each and all so extraordinary then isn t that why one must just resign one s self to wash one s hands of them to be lost her face however so met the question as if it were but a flicker of the old tone that their trouble had now become too real for her charged eyes so betrayed the condition of her nerves that he stepped back alertly enough to firmer ground he had spoken before in this light of a plain man s vision but he must be something more than a plain man now hasn t she then charlotte always her husband to complain to she d rather die oh and bob assingham s face at the vision of such extremities lengthened for very docility hasn t she the prince then for such matters oh he doesn t count i thought that was just what as the basis of our agitation he does do mrs assingham however had her distinction ready not a bit as a person to bore with complaints the ground of my agitation is exactly that she never on any pretext bores him not charlotte and in the imagination of mrs verver s superiority to any such mistake she gave characteristically something like a toss of her head as marked a tribute to that lady s general grace in all the conditions as the personage referred to doubtless had ever received ah only maggie with which the colonel gave a short low gurgle but it found his wife again prepared no not only maggie a great many people in london and small wonder bore him maggie only worst then but it was a question that he had promptly dropped at the returning brush of another of which she had shortly before sown the seed you said just now that he would by this time be back with charlotte if they have arrived you think it then possible that they really won t have returned his companion exhibited to view for the idea a sense of her responsibility but this was insufficient clearly to keep her from entertaining it i think there s nothing they re not now capable of in their so intense good faith good faith he echoed the words which had in fact something of an odd ring critically their false position it comes to the same thing and she bore down with her decision the superficial lack of sequence they may very possibly for a demonstration as i see them not have come back he wondered visibly at this how she did see them may have bolted somewhere together may have stayed over at matcham itself till tomorrow may have wired home each of them since maggie left me may have done fanny assingham continued god knows what she went on suddenly with more emotion which at the pressure of some spring of her inner vision broke out in a wail of distress imperfectly smothered whatever they ve done i shall never know never never because i don t want to and because nothing will induce me so they may do as they like but i ve worked for them all she uttered this last with another irrepressible quaver and the next moment her tears had come though she had with the explosion quitted her husband as if to hide it from him she passed into the dusky drawing room where during his own prowl shortly previous he had drawn up a blind so that the light of the street lamps came in a little at the window she made for this window against which she leaned her head while the colonel with his lengthened face looked after her for a minute and hesitated he might have been wondering what she had really done to what extent beyond his knowledge or his conception in the affairs of these people she could have committed herself but to hear her cry and yet try not to was quickly enough too much for him he had known her at other times quite not try not to and that had not been so bad he went to her and put his arm round her he drew her head to his breast where while she gasped she let it stay a little all with a patience that presently stilled her yet the effect of this small crisis oddly enough was not to close their colloquy with the natural result of sending them to bed what was between them had opened out further had somehow through the sharp show of her feeling taken a positive stride had entered as it were without more words the region of the understood shutting the door after it and bringing them so still more nearly face to face they remained for some minutes looking at it through the dim window which opened upon the world of human trouble in general and which let the vague light play here and there upon gilt and crystal and colour the florid features looming dimly of fanny s drawing room and the beauty of what thus passed between them passed with her cry of pain with her burst of tears with his wonderment and his kindness and his comfort with the moments of their silence above all which might have represented their sinking together hand in hand for a time into the mystic lake where he had begun as we have hinted by seeing her paddle alone the beauty of it was that they now could really talk better than before because the basis had at last once for all defined itself what was the basis which fanny absolutely exacted but that charlotte and the prince must be saved so far as consistently speaking of them as still safe might save them it did save them somehow for fanny s troubled mind for that was the nature of the mind of women he conveyed to her now at all events by refusing her no gentleness that he had sufficiently got the tip and that the tip was all he had wanted this remained quite clear even when he presently reverted to what she had told him of her recent passage with maggie i don t altogether see you know what you infer from it or why you infer anything when he so expressed himself it was quite as if in possession of what they had brought up from the depths xxiv i can t say more this made his companion reply than that something in her face her voice and her whole manner acted upon me as nothing in her had ever acted before and just for the reason above all that i felt her trying her very best and her very best poor duck is very good to be quiet and natural it s when one sees people who always are natural making little pale pathetic blinking efforts for it then it is that one knows something s the matter i can t describe my impression you would have had it for yourself and the only thing that ever can be the matter with maggie is that by that i mean her beginning to doubt to doubt for the first time mrs assingham wound up of her wonderful little judgment of her wonderful little world it was impressive fanny s vision and the colonel as if himself agitated by it took another turn of prowling to doubt of fidelity to doubt of friendship poor duck indeed it will go hard with her but she ll put it all he concluded on charlotte mrs assingham still darkly contemplative denied this with a headshake she won t put it anywhere she won t do with it anything anyone else would she ll take it all herself you mean she ll make it out her own fault yes she ll find means somehow to arrive at that ah then the colonel dutifully declared she s indeed a little brick oh his wife returned you ll see in one way or another to what tune and she spoke of a sudden with an approach to elation so that as if immediately feeling his surprise she turned round to him she ll see me somehow through see you yes me i m the worst for said fanny assingham now with a harder exaltation i did it all i recognise that i accept it she won t cast it up at me she won t cast up anything so i throw myself upon her she ll bear me up she spoke almost volubly she held him with her sudden sharpness she ll carry the whole weight of us there was still nevertheless wonder in it you mean she won t mind i say love and he not unkindly stared then where s the difficulty there isn t any fanny declared with the same rich emphasis it kept him indeed as by the loss of the thread looking at her longer ah you mean there isn t any for us she met his look for a minute as if it perhaps a little too much imputed a selfishness a concern at any cost for their own surface then she might have been deciding that their own surface was after all what they had most to consider not she said with dignity if we properly keep our heads she appeared even to signify that they would begin by keeping them now this was what it was to have at last a constituted basis do you remember what you said to me that night of my first real anxiety after the foreign office party in the carriage as we came home yes he could recall it leave them to pull through precisely trust their own wit you practically said to save all appearances well i ve trusted it i have left them to pull through he hesitated and your point is that they re not doing so i ve left them she went on but now i see how and where i ve been leaving them all the while without knowing it to her to the princess and that s what i mean mrs assingham pensively pursued that s what happened to me with her to day she continued to explain it came home to me that that s what i ve really been doing oh i see i needn t torment myself she has taken them over the colonel declared that he saw yet it was as if at this he a little sightlessly stared but what then has happened from one day to the other to her what has opened her eyes they were never really shut she misses him then why hasn t she missed him before well facing him there among their domestic glooms and glints fanny worked it out she did but she wouldn t let herself know it she had her reason she wore her blind now at last her situation has come to a head to day she does know it and that s illuminating it has been mrs assingham wound up illuminating to me her husband attended but the momentary effect of his attention was vagueness again and the refuge of his vagueness was a gasp poor dear little girl ah no don t pity her this did however pull him up we mayn t even be sorry for her not now or at least not yet it s too soon that is if it isn t very much too late this will depend mrs assingham went on at any rate we shall see we might have pitied her before for all the good it would then have done her we might have begun some time ago now however she has begun to live and the way it comes to me the way it comes to me but again she projected her vision the way it comes to you can scarcely be that she ll like it the way it comes to me is that she will live the way it comes to me is that she ll triumph she said this with so sudden a prophetic flare that it fairly cheered her husband ah then we must back her no we mustn t touch her we mayn t touch any of them we must keep our hands off we must go on tiptoe we must simply watch and wait and meanwhile said mrs assingham we must bear it as we can that s where we are and serves us right we re in presence and so moving about the room as in communion with shadowy portents she left it till he questioned again in presence of what well of something possibly beautiful beautiful as it may come off she had paused there before him while he wondered you mean she ll get the prince back she raised her hand in quick impatience the suggestion might have been almost abject it isn t a question of recovery it won t be a question of any vulgar struggle to get him back she must have lost him and to have lost him she must have had him with which fanny shook her head what i take her to be waking up to is the truth that all the while she really hasn t had him never ah my dear the poor colonel panted never his wife repeated and she went on without pity do you remember what i said to you long ago that evening just before their marriage when charlotte had so suddenly turned up the smile with which he met this appeal was not it was to be feared robust what haven t you love said in your time so many things no doubt that they make a chance for my having once or twice spoken the truth i never spoke it more at all events than when i put it to you that evening that maggie was the person in the world to whom a wrong thing could least be communicated it was as if her imagination had been closed to it her sense altogether sealed that therefore fanny continued is what will now have to happen her sense will have to open i see he nodded to the wrong he nodded again almost cheerfully as if he had been keeping the peace with a baby or a lunatic to the very very wrong but his wife s spirit after its effort of wing was able to remain higher to what s called evil with a very big e for the first time in her life to the discovery of it to the knowledge of it to the crude experience of it and she gave for the possibility the largest measure to the harsh bewildering brush the daily chilling breath of it unless indeed and here mrs assingham noted a limit unless indeed as yet so far as she has come and if she comes no further simply to the suspicion and the dread what we shall see is whether that mere dose of alarm will prove enough he considered but enough for what then dear if not enough to break her heart enough to give her a shaking mrs assingham rather oddly replied to give her i mean the right one the right one won t break her heart it will make her she explained well it will make her by way of a change understand one or two things in the world but isn t it a pity the colonel asked that they should happen to be the one or two that will be the most disagreeable to her oh disagreeable they ll have had to be disagreeable to show her a little where she is they ll have had to be disagreeable to make her sit up they ll have had to be disagreeable to make her decide to live bob assingham was now at the window while his companion slowly revolved he had lighted a cigarette for final patience and he seemed vaguely to time her as she moved to and fro he had at the same time to do justice to the lucidity she had at last attained and it was doubtless by way of expression of this teachability that he let his eyes for a minute roll as from the force of feeling over the upper dusk of the room he had thought of the response his wife s words ideally implied decide to live ah yes for her child oh bother her child and he had never felt so snubbed for an exemplary view as when fanny now stopped short to live you poor dear for her father which is another pair of sleeves and mrs assingham s whole ample ornamented person irradiated with this the truth that had begun under so much handling to glow any idiot can do things for her child she ll have a motive more original and we shall see how it will work her she ll have to save him to save him to keep her father from her own knowledge that and she seemed to see it before her in her husband s very eyes will be work cut out with which as at the highest conceivable climax she wound up their colloquy good night there was something in her manner however or in the effect at least of this supreme demonstration that had fairly and by a single touch lifted him to her side so that after she had turned her back to regain the landing and the staircase he overtook her before she had begun to mount with the ring of excited perception ah but you know that s rather jolly jolly she turned upon it again at the foot of the staircase i mean it s rather charming charming it had still to be their law a little that she was tragic when he was comic i mean it s rather beautiful you just said yourself it would be only he pursued promptly with the impetus of this idea and as if it had suddenly touched with light for him connections hitherto dim only i don t quite see why that very care for him which has carried her to such other lengths precisely as affect one as so rum hasn t also by the same stroke made her notice a little more what has been going on ah there you are it s the question that i ve all along been asking myself she had rested her eyes on the carpet but she raised them as she pursued she let him have it straight and it s the question of an idiot an idiot well the idiot that i ve been in all sorts of ways so often of late have i asked it you re excusable since you ask it but now the answer i saw to day has all the while been staring me in the face then what in the world is it why the very intensity of her conscience about him the very passion of her brave little piety that s the way it has worked mrs assingham explained and i admit it to have been as rum a way as possible but it has been working from a rum start from the moment the dear man married to ease his daughter off and it then happened by an extraordinary perversity that the very opposite effect was produced with the renewed vision of this fatality however she could give but a desperate shrug i see the colonel sympathetically mused that was a rum start but his very response as she again flung up her arms seemed to make her sense for a moment intolerable yes there i am i was really at the bottom of it she declared i don t know what possessed me but i planned for him i goaded him on with which however the next moment she took herself up or rather i do know what possessed me for wasn t he beset with ravening women right and left and didn t he quite pathetically appeal for protection didn t he quite charmingly show one how he needed and desired it maggie she thus lucidly continued couldn t with a new life of her own give herself up to doing for him in the future all she had done in the past to fencing him in to keeping him safe and keeping them off one perceived this she went on out of the abundance of one s affection and one s sympathy it all blessedly came back to her when it wasn t all for the fiftieth time obscured in face of the present facts by anxiety and compunction one was no doubt a meddlesome fool one always is to think one sees people s lives for them better than they see them for themselves but one s excuse here she insisted was that these people clearly didn t see them for themselves didn t see them at all it struck one for very pity that they were making a mess of such charming material that they were but wasting it and letting it go they didn t know how to live and somehow one couldn t if one took an interest in them at all simply stand and see it that s what i pay for and the poor woman in straighter communion with her companion s intelligence at this moment she appeared to feel than she had ever been before let him have the whole of the burden of her consciousness i always pay for it sooner or later my sociable my damnable my unnecessary interest nothing of course would suit me but that it should fix itself also on charlotte charlotte who was hovering there on the edge of our lives when not beautifully and a trifle mysteriously flitting across them and who was a piece of waste and a piece of threatened failure just as for any possible good to the world mr verver and maggie were it began to come over me in the watches of the night that charlotte was a person who could keep off ravening women without being one herself either in the vulgar way of the others and that this service to mr verver would be a sweet employment for her future there was something of course that might have stopped me you know you know what i mean it looks at me she veritably moaned out of your face but all i can say is that it didn t the reason largely being once i had fallen in love with the beautiful symmetry of my plan that i seemed to feel sure maggie would accept charlotte whereas i didn t quite make out either what other woman or what other kind of woman one could think of her accepting i see i see she had paused meeting all the while his listening look and the fever of her retrospect had so risen with her talk that the desire was visibly strong in him to meet her on his side but with cooling breath one quite understands my dear it only however kept her there sombre i naturally see love what you understand which sits again perfectly in your eyes you see that i saw that maggie would accept her in helpless ignorance yes dearest and the grimness of her dreariness suddenly once more possessed her you ve only to tell me that that knowledge was my reason for what i did how when you do can i stand up to you you see she said with an ineffable headshake that i don t stand up i m down down down she declared yet she as quickly added there s just one little thing that helps to save my life and she kept him waiting but an instant they might easily they would perhaps even certainly have done something worse he thought worse than that charlotte ah don t tell me she cried that there could have been nothing worse there might as they were have been many things charlotte in her way is extraordinary he was almost simultaneous extraordinary she observes the forms said fanny assingham he hesitated with the prince for the prince and with the others she went on with mr verver wonderfully but above all with maggie and the forms she had to do even them justice are two thirds of conduct say he had married a woman who would have made a hash of them but he jerked back ah my dear i wouldn t say it for the world say she none the less pursued he had married a woman the prince would really have cared for you mean then he doesn t care for charlotte this was still a new view to jump to and the colonel perceptibly wished to make sure of the necessity of the effort for that while he stared his wife allowed him time at the end of which she simply said no then what on earth are they up to still however she only looked at him so that standing there before her with his hands in his pockets he had time further to risk soothingly another question are the forms you speak of that are two thirds of conduct what will be keeping her now by your hypothesis from coming home with him till morning yes absolutely their forms theirs maggie s and mr verver s those they impose on charlotte and the prince those she developed that so perversely as i say have succeeded in setting themselves up as the right ones he considered but only now at last really to relapse into woe your perversity my dear is exactly what i don t understand the state of things existing hasn t grown like a field of mushrooms in a night whatever they all round may be in for now is at least the consequence of what they ve done are they mere helpless victims of fate well fanny at last had the courage of it yes they are to be so abjectly innocent that is to be victims of fate and charlotte and the prince are abjectly innocent it took her another minute but she rose to the full height yes that is they were as much so in their way as the others there were beautiful intentions all round the prince s and charlotte s were beautiful of that i had my faith they were i d go to the stake otherwise she added i should have been a wretch and i ve not been a wretch i ve only been a double dyed donkey ah then he asked what does our muddle make them to have been well too much taken up with considering each other you may call such a mistake as that by what ever name you please it at any rate means all round their case it illustrates the misfortune said mrs assingham gravely of being too too charming this was another matter that took some following but the colonel again did his best yes but to whom doesn t it rather depend on that to whom have the prince and charlotte then been too charming to each other in the first place obviously and then both of them together to maggie to maggie he wonderingly echoed to maggie she was now crystalline by having accepted from the first so guilelessly yes so guilelessly themselves her guileless idea of still having her father of keeping him fast in her life then isn t one supposed in common humanity and if one hasn t quarrelled with him and one has the means and he on his side doesn t drink or kick up rows isn t one supposed to keep one s aged parent in one s life certainly when there aren t particular reasons against it that there may be others than his getting drunk is exactly the moral of what is before us in the first place mr verver isn t aged the colonel just hung fire but it came then why the deuce does he oh poor dear man behave as if he were she took a moment to meet it how do you know how he behaves well my own love we see how charlotte does again at this she faltered but again she rose ah isn t my whole point that he s charming to her doesn t it depend a bit on what she regards as charming she faced the question as if it were flippant then with a headshake of dignity she brushed it away it s mr verver who s really young it s charlotte who s really old and what i was saying she added isn t affected you were saying he did her the justice that they re all guileless that they were guileless all at first quite extraordinarily it s what i mean by their failure to see that the more they took for granted they could work together the more they were really working apart for i repeat fanny went on that i really believe charlotte and the prince honestly to have made up their minds originally that their very esteem for mr verver which was serious as well it might be would save them i see the colonel inclined himself and save him it comes to the same thing then save maggie that comes said mrs assingham to something a little different for maggie has done the most he wondered what do you call the most well she did it originally she began the vicious circle for that though you make round eyes at my associating her with vice is simply what it has been it s their mutual consideration all round that has made it the bottomless gulf and they re really so embroiled but because in their way they ve been so improbably good in their way yes the colonel grinned which was above all maggie s way no flicker of his ribaldry was anything to her now maggie had in the first place to make up to her father for her having suffered herself to become poor little dear as she believed so intensely married then she had to make up to her husband for taking so much of the time they might otherwise have spent together to make this reparation to mr verver perfect and her way to do this precisely was by allowing the prince the use the enjoyment whatever you may call it of charlotte to cheer his path by instalments as it were in proportion as she herself making sure her father was all right might be missed from his side by so much at the same time however mrs assingham further explained by so much as she took her young stepmother for this purpose away from mr verver by just so much did this too strike her as something again to be made up for it has saddled her you will easily see with a positively new obligation to her father an obligation created and aggravated by her unfortunate even if quite heroic little sense of justice she began with wanting to show him that his marriage could never under whatever temptation of her own bliss with the prince become for her a pretext for deserting or neglecting him then that in its order entailed her wanting to show the prince that she recognised how the other desire this wish to remain intensely the same passionate little daughter she had always been involved in some degree and just for the present so to speak her neglecting and deserting him i quite hold fanny with characteristic amplitude parenthesised that a person can mostly feel but one passion one tender passion that is at a time only that doesn t hold good for our primary and instinctive attachments the voice of blood such as one s feeling for a parent or a brother those may be intense and yet not prevent other intensities as you will recognise my dear when you remember how i continued tout betement to adore my mother whom you didn t adore for years after i had begun to adore you well maggie she kept it up is in the same situation as i was plus complications from which i was thank heaven exempt plus the complication above all of not having in the least begun with the sense for complications that i should have had before she knew it at any rate her little scruples and her little lucidities which were really so divinely blind her feverish little sense of justice as i say had brought the two others together as her grossest misconduct couldn t have done and now she knows something or other has happened yet hasn t heretofore known what she has only piled up her remedy poor child something that she has earnestly but confusedly seen as her necessary policy piled it on top of the policy on top of the remedy that she at first thought out for herself and that would really have needed since then so much modification her only modification has been the growth of her necessity to prevent her father s wondering if all in their life in common may be so certainly for the best she has now as never before to keep him unconscious that peculiar if he makes a point of it as their situation is there s anything in it all uncomfortable or disagreeable anything morally the least out of the way she has to keep touching it up to make it each day each month look natural and normal to him so that god forgive me the comparison she s like an old woman who has taken to painting and who has to lay it on thicker to carry it off with a greater audacity with a greater impudence even the older she grows and fanny stood a moment captivated with the image she had thrown off i like the idea of maggie audacious and impudent learning to be so to gloss things over she could she even will yet i believe learn it for that sacred purpose consummately diabolically for from the moment the dear man should see it s all rouge she paused staring at the vision it imparted itself even to bob then the fun would begin as it but made her look at him hard however he amended the form of his inquiry you mean that in that case she will charming creature be lost she was silent a moment more as i ve told you before she won t be lost if her father s saved she ll see that as salvation enough the colonel took it in then she s a little heroine rather she s a little heroine but it s his innocence above all mrs assingham added that will pull them through her companion at this focussed again mr verver s innocence it s awfully quaint of course it s awfully quaint that it s awfully quaint that the pair are awfully quaint quaint with all our dear old quaintness by which i don t mean yours and mine but that of my own sweet countrypeople from whom i ve so deplorably degenerated that mrs assingham declared was originally the head and front of their appeal to me and of my interest in them and of course i shall feel them quainter still she rather ruefully subjoined before they ve done with me this might be but it wasn t what most stood in the colonel s way you believe so in mr verver s innocence after two years of charlotte she stared but the whole point is just that two years of charlotte are what he hasn t really or what you may call undividedly had any more than maggie by your theory eh has really or undividedly had four of the prince it takes all she hasn t had the colonel conceded to account for the innocence that in her too so leaves us in admiration so far as it might be ribald again she let this pass it takes a great many things to account for maggie what is definite at all events is that strange though this be her effort for her father has up to now sufficiently succeeded she has made him she makes him accept the tolerably obvious oddity of their relation all round for part of the game behind her there protected and amused and as it were exquisitely humbugged the principino in whom he delights always aiding he has safely and serenely enough suffered the conditions of his life to pass for those he had sublimely projected he hadn t worked them out in detail any more than i had heaven pity me and the queerness has been exactly in the detail this for him is what it was to have married charlotte and they both she neatly wound up help both i mean that if maggie always in the breach makes it seem to him all so flourishingly to fit charlotte does her part not less and her part is very large charlotte fanny declared works like a horse so there it all was and her husband looked at her a minute across it and what does the prince work like she fixed him in return like a prince whereupon breaking short off to ascend to her room she presented her highly decorated back in which in odd places controlling the complications of its aspect the ruby or the garnet the turquoise and the topaz gleamed like faint symbols of the wit that pinned together the satin patches of her argument he watched her as if she left him positively under the impression of her mastery of her subject yes as if the real upshot of the drama before them was but that he had when it came to the tight places of life as life had shrunk for him now the most luminous of wives he turned off in this view of her majestic retreat the comparatively faint little electric lamp which had presided over their talk then he went up as immediately behind her as the billows of her amber train allowed making out how all the clearness they had conquered was even for herself a relief how at last the sense of the amplitude of her exposition sustained and floated her joining her however on the landing above where she had already touched a metallic point into light he found she had done perhaps even more to create than to extinguish in him the germ of a curiosity he held her a minute longer there was another plum in the pie what did you mean some minutes ago by his not caring for charlotte the prince s by his not really caring she recalled after a little benevolently enough i mean that men don t when it has all been too easy that s how in nine cases out of ten a woman is treated who has risked her life you asked me just now how he works she added but you might better perhaps have asked me how he plays well he made it up like a prince like a prince he is profoundly a prince for that she said with expression he s beautifully a case they re far rarer even in the highest circles than they pretend to be and that s what makes so much of his value he s perhaps one of the very last the last of the real ones so it is we must take him we must take him all round the colonel considered and how must charlotte if anything happens take him the question held her a minute and while she waited with her eyes on him she put out a grasping hand to his arm in the flesh of which he felt her answer distinctly enough registered thus she gave him standing off a little the firmest longest deepest injunction he had ever received from her nothing in spite of everything will happen nothing has happened nothing is happening he looked a trifle disappointed i see for us for us for whom else and he was to feel indeed how she wished him to understand it we know nothing on earth it was an undertaking he must sign so he wrote as it were his name we know nothing on earth it was like the soldiers watchword at night we re as innocent she went on in the same way as babes why not rather say he asked as innocent as they themselves are oh for the best of reasons because we re much more so he wondered but how can we be more for them oh easily we can be anything absolute idiots then absolute idiots and oh fanny breathed the way it will rest us well he looked as if there were something in that but won t they know we re not she barely hesitated charlotte and the prince think we are which is so much gained mr verver believes in our intelligence but he doesn t matter and maggie doesn t she know that we see before our noses yes this indeed took longer oh so far as she may guess it she ll give no sign so it comes to the same thing he raised his eyebrows comes to our not being able to help her that s the way we shall help her by looking like fools she threw up her hands she only wants herself to look like a bigger so there we are with which she brushed it away his conformity was promised something however still held her it broke to her own vision as a last wave of clearness moreover now she said i see i mean she added what you were asking me how i knew to day in eaton square that maggie s awake and she had indeed visibly got it it was by seeing them together seeing her with her father he fell behind again but you ve seen her often enough before never with my present eyes for nothing like such a test that of this length of the others absence together has hitherto occurred possibly but if she and mr verver insisted upon it why is it such a test because it has become one without their intending it it has spoiled so to speak on their hands it has soured eh the colonel said the word s horrible say rather it has changed perhaps fanny went on she did wish to see how much she can bear in that case she has seen only it was she alone who about the visit insisted her father insists on nothing and she watches him do it her husband looked impressed watches him for the first faint sign i mean of his noticing it doesn t as i tell you come but she s there for it to see and i felt she continued how she s there i caught her as it were in the fact she couldn t keep it from me though she left her post on purpose came home with me to throw dust in my eyes i took it all her dust but it was what showed me with which supreme lucidity she reached the door of her room luckily it showed me also how she has succeeded nothing from him has come you re so awfully sure sure nothing will good night she said she ll die first the golden bowl volume ii book second the princess part fourth xxv it was not till many days had passed that the princess began to accept the idea of having done a little something she was not always doing or indeed that of having listened to any inward voice that spoke in a new tone yet these instinctive postponements of reflection were the fruit positively of recognitions and perceptions already active of the sense above all that she had made at a particular hour made by the mere touch of her hand a difference in the situation so long present to her as practically unattackable this situation had been occupying for months and months the very centre of the garden of her life but it had reared itself there like some strange tall tower of ivory or perhaps rather some wonderful beautiful but outlandish pagoda a structure plated with hard bright porcelain coloured and figured and adorned at the overhanging eaves with silver bells that tinkled ever so charmingly when stirred by chance airs she had walked round and round it that was what she felt she had carried on her existence in the space left her for circulation a space that sometimes seemed ample and sometimes narrow looking up all the while at the fair structure that spread itself so amply and rose so high but never quite making out as yet where she might have entered had she wished she had not wished till now such was the odd case and what was doubtless equally odd besides was that though her raised eyes seemed to distinguish places that must serve from within and especially far aloft as apertures and outlooks no door appeared to give access from her convenient garden level the great decorated surface had remained consistently impenetrable and inscrutable at present however to her considering mind it was as if she had ceased merely to circle and to scan the elevation ceased so vaguely so quite helplessly to stare and wonder she had caught herself distinctly in the act of pausing then in that of lingering and finally in that of stepping unprecedentedly near the thing might have been by the distance at which it kept her a mahometan mosque with which no base heretic could take a liberty there so hung about it the vision of one s putting off one s shoes to enter and even verily of one s paying with one s life if found there as an interloper she had not certainly arrived at the conception of paying with her life for anything she might do but it was nevertheless quite as if she had sounded with a tap or two one of the rare porcelain plates she had knocked in short though she could scarce have said whether for admission or for what she had applied her hand to a cool smooth spot and had waited to see what would happen something had happened it was as if a sound at her touch after a little had come back to her from within a sound sufficiently suggesting that her approach had been noted if this image however may represent our young woman s consciousness of a recent change in her life a change now but a few days old it must at the same time be observed that she both sought and found in renewed circulation as i have called it a measure of relief from the idea of having perhaps to answer for what she had done the pagoda in her blooming garden figured the arrangement how otherwise was it to be named by which so strikingly she had been able to marry without breaking as she liked to put it with the past she had surrendered herself to her husband without the shadow of a reserve or a condition and yet she had not all the while given up her father the least little inch she had compassed the high city of seeing the two men beautifully take to each other and nothing in her marriage had marked it as more happy than this fact of its having practically given the elder the lonelier a new friend what had moreover all the while enriched the whole aspect of success was that the latter s marriage had been no more meassurably paid for than her own his having taken the same great step in the same free way had not in the least involved the relegation of his daughter that it was remarkable they should have been able at once so to separate and so to keep together had never for a moment from however far back been equivocal to her that it was remarkable had in fact quite counted at first and always and for each of them equally as part of their inspiration and their support there were plenty of singular things they were not enamoured of flights of brilliancy of audacity of originality that speaking at least for the dear man and herself were not at all in their line but they liked to think they had given their life this unusual extension and this liberal form which many families many couples and still more many pairs of couples would not have found workable that last truth had been distinctly brought home to them by the bright testimony the quite explicit envy of most of their friends who had remarked to them again and again that they must on all the showing to keep on such terms be people of the highest amiability equally including in the praise of course amerigo and charlotte it had given them pleasure as how should it not to find themselves shed such a glamour it had certainly that is given pleasure to her father and herself both of them distinguishably of a nature so slow to presume that they would scarce have been sure of their triumph without this pretty reflection of it so it was that their felicity had fructified so it was that the ivory tower visible and admirable doubtless from any point of the social field had risen stage by stage maggie s actual reluctance to ask herself with proportionate sharpness why she had ceased to take comfort in the sight of it represented accordingly a lapse from that ideal consistency on which her moral comfort almost at any time depended to remain consistent she had always been capable of cutting down more or less her prior term moving for the first time in her life as in the darkening shadow of a false position she reflected that she should either not have ceased to be right that is to be confident or have recognised that she was wrong though she tried to deal with herself for a space only as a silken coated spaniel who has scrambled out of a pond and who rattles the water from his ears her shake of her head again and again as she went was much of that order and she had the resource to which save for the rude equivalent of his generalising bark the spaniel would have been a stranger of humming to herself hard as a sign that nothing had happened to her she had not so to speak fallen in she had had no accident and had not got wet this at any rate was her pretension until after she began a little to wonder if she mightn t with or without exposure have taken cold she could at all events remember no time at which she had felt so excited and certainly none which was another special point that so brought with it as well the necessity for concealing excitement this birth of a new eagerness became a high pastime in her view precisely by reason of the ingenuity required for keeping the thing born out of sight the ingenuity was thus a private and absorbing exercise in the light of which might i so far multiply my metaphors i should compare her to the frightened but clinging young mother of an unlawful child the idea that had possession of her would be by our new analogy the proof of her misadventure but likewise all the while only another sign of a relation that was more to her than anything on earth she had lived long enough to make out for herself that any deep seated passion has its pangs as well as its joys and that we are made by its aches and its anxieties most richly conscious of it she had never doubted of the force of the feeling that bound her to her husband but to become aware almost suddenly that it had begun to vibrate with a violence that had some of the effect of a strain would rightly looked at after all but show that she was like thousands of women every day acting up to the full privilege of passion why in the world shouldn t she with every right if on consideration she saw no good reason against it the best reason against it would have been the possibility of some consequence disagreeable or inconvenient to others especially to such others as had never incommoded her by the egotism of their passions but if once that danger were duly guarded against the fulness of one s measure amounted to no more than the equal use of one s faculties or the proper playing of one s part it had come to the princess obscurely at first but little by little more conceivably that her faculties had not for a good while been concomitantly used the case resembled in a manner that of her once loved dancing a matter of remembered steps that had grown vague from her ceasing to go to balls she would go to balls again that seemed freely even crudely stated the remedy she would take out of the deep receptacles in which she had laid them away the various ornaments congruous with the greater occasions and of which her store she liked to think was none of the smallest she would have been easily to be figured for us at this occupation dipping at off moments and quiet hours in snatched visits and by draughty candle light into her rich collections and seeing her jewels again a little shyly but all unmistakably glow that in fact may pass as the very picture of her semi smothered agitation of the diversion she to some extent successfully found in referring her crisis so far as was possible to the mere working of her own needs it must be added however that she would have been at a loss to determine and certainly at first to which order that of self control or that of large expression the step she had taken the afternoon of her husband s return from matcham with his companion properly belonged for it had been a step distinctly on maggie s part her deciding to do something just then and there which would strike amerigo as unusual and this even though her departure from custom had merely consisted in her so arranging that he wouldn t find her as he would definitely expect to do in eaton square he would have strangely enough as might seem to him to come back home for it and there get the impression of her rather pointedly or at least all impatiently and independently awaiting him these were small variations and mild manoeuvres but they went accompanied on maggie s part as we have mentioned with an infinite sense of intention her watching by his fireside for her husband s return from an absence might superficially have presented itself as the most natural act in the world and the only one into the bargain on which he would positively have reckoned it fell by this circumstance into the order of plain matters and yet the very aspect by which it was in the event handed over to her brooding fancy was the fact that she had done with it all she had designed she had put her thought to the proof and the proof had shown its edge this was what was before her that she was no longer playing with blunt and idle tools with weapons that didn t cut there passed across her vision ten times a day the gleam of a bare blade and at this it was that she most shut her eyes most knew the impulse to cheat herself with motion and sound she had merely driven on a certain wednesday to portland place instead of remaining in eaton square and she privately repeated it again and again there had appeared beforehand no reason why she should have seen the mantle of history flung by a single sharp sweep over so commonplace a deed that all the same was what had happened it had been bitten into her mind all in an hour that nothing she had ever done would hereafter in some way yet to be determined so count for her perhaps not even what she had done in accepting in their old golden rome amerigo s proposal of marriage and yet by her little crouching posture there that of a timid tigress she had meant nothing recklessly ultimate nothing clumsily fundamental so that she called it names the invidious the grotesque attitude holding it up to her own ridicule reducing so far as she could the portee of what had followed it she had but wanted to get nearer nearer to something indeed that she couldn t that she wouldn t even to herself describe and the degree of this achieved nearness was what had been in advance incalculable her actual multiplication of distractions and suppressions whatever it did for her failed to prevent her living over again any chosen minute for she could choose them she could fix them of the freshness of relation produced by her having administered to her husband the first surprise to which she had ever treated him it had been a poor thing but it had been all her own and the whole passage was backwardly there a great picture hung on the wall of her daily life for her to make what she would of it fell for retrospect into a succession of moments that were watchable still almost in the manner of the different things done during a scene on the stage some scene so acted as to have left a great impression on the tenant of one of the stalls several of these moments stood out beyond the others and those she could feel again most count again like the firm pearls on a string had belonged more particularly to the lapse of time before dinner dinner which had been so late quite at nine o clock that evening thanks to the final lateness of amerigo s own advent these were parts of the experience though in fact there had been a good many of them between which her impression could continue sharply to discriminate before the subsequent passages much later on it was to be said the flame of memory turned to an equalising glow that of a lamp in some side chapel in which incense was thick the great moment at any rate for conscious repossession was doubtless the first the strange little timed silence which she had fully gauged on the spot as altogether beyond her own intention but which for just how long should she ever really know for just how long she could do nothing to break she was in the smaller drawing room in which she always sat and she had by calculation dressed for dinner on finally coming in it was a wonder how many things she had calculated in respect to this small incident a matter for the importance of which she had so quite indefinite a measure he would be late he would be very late that was the one certainty that seemed to look her in the face there was still also the possibility that if he drove with charlotte straight to eaton square he might think it best to remain there even on learning she had come away she had left no message for him on any such chance this was another of her small shades of decision though the effect of it might be to keep him still longer absent he might suppose she would already have dined he might stay with all he would have to tell just on purpose to be nice to her father she had known him to stretch the point to these beautiful ends far beyond that he had more than once stretched it to the sacrifice of the opportunity of dressing if she herself had now avoided any such sacrifice and had made herself during the time at her disposal quite inordinately fresh and quite positively smart this had probably added while she waited and waited to that very tension of spirit in which she was afterwards to find the image of her having crouched she did her best quite intensely by herself to banish any such appearance she couldn t help it if she couldn t read her pale novel ah that par exemple was beyond her but she could at least sit by the lamp with the book sit there with her newest frock worn for the first time sticking out all round her quite stiff and grand even perhaps a little too stiff and too grand for a familiar and domestic frock yet marked none the less this time she ventured to hope by incontestable intrinsic merit she had glanced repeatedly at the clock but she had refused herself the weak indulgence of walking up and down though the act of doing so she knew would make her feel on the polished floor with the rustle and the hang still more beautifully bedecked the difficulty was that it would also make her feel herself still more sharply in a state which was exactly what she proposed not to do the only drops of her anxiety had been when her thought strayed complacently with her eyes to the front of her gown which was in a manner a refuge a beguilement especially when she was able to fix it long enough to wonder if it would at last really satisfy charlotte she had ever been in respect to her clothes rather timorous and uncertain for the last year above all she had lived in the light of charlotte s possible and rather inscrutable judgment of them charlotte s own were simply the most charming and interesting that any woman had ever put on there was a kind of poetic justice in her being at last able in this particular thanks to means thanks quite to omnipotence freely to exercise her genius but maggie would have described herself as in these connections constantly and intimately torn conscious on one side of the impossibility of copying her companion and conscious on the other of the impossibility of sounding her independently to the bottom yes it was one of the things she should go down to her grave without having known how charlotte after all had been said really thought her stepdaughter looked under any supposedly ingenious personal experiment she had always been lovely about the stepdaughter s material braveries had done for her the very best with them but there had ever fitfully danced at the back of maggie s head the suspicion that these expressions were mercies not judgments embodying no absolute but only a relative frankness hadn t charlotte with so perfect a critical vision if the truth were known given her up as hopeless hopeless by a serious standard and thereby invented for her a different and inferior one in which as the only thing to be done she patiently and soothingly abetted her hadn t she in other words assented in secret despair perhaps even in secret irritation to her being ridiculous so that the best now possible was to wonder once in a great while whether one mightn t give her the surprise of something a little less out of the true note than usual something of this kind was the question that maggie while the absentees still delayed asked of the appearance she was endeavouring to present but with the result repeatedly again that it only went and lost itself in the thick air that had begun more and more to hang for our young woman over her accumulations of the unanswered they were there these accumulations they were like a roomful of confused objects never as yet sorted which for some time now she had been passing and re passing along the corridor of her life she passed it when she could without opening the door then on occasion she turned the key to throw in a fresh contribution so it was that she had been getting things out of the way they rejoined the rest of the confusion it was as if they found their place by some instinct of affinity in the heap they knew in short where to go and when she at present by a mental act once more pushed the door open she had practically a sense of method and experience what she should never know about charlotte s thought she tossed that in it would find itself in company and she might at last have been standing there long enough to see it fall into its corner the sight moreover would doubtless have made her stare had her attention been more free the sight of the mass of vain things congruous incongruous that awaited every addition it made her in fact with a vague gasp turn away and what had further determined this was the final sharp extinction of the inward scene by the outward the quite different door had opened and her husband was there it had been as strange as she could consent afterwards to think it it had been essentially what had made the abrupt bend in her life he had come back had followed her from the other house visibly uncertain this was written in the face he for the first minute showed her it had been written only for those seconds and it had appeared to go quickly after they began to talk but while it lasted it had been written large and though she didn t quite know what she had expected of him she felt she hadn t expected the least shade of embarrassment what had made the embarrassment she called it embarrassment so as to be able to assure herself she put it at the very worst what had made the particular look was his thus distinguishably wishing to see how he should find her why first that had later on kept coming to her the question dangled there as if it were the key to everything with the sense of it on the spot she had felt overwhelmingly that she was significant that so she must instantly strike him and that this had a kind of violence beyond what she had intended it was in fact even at the moment not absent from her view that he might easily have made an abject fool of her at least for the time she had indeed for just ten seconds been afraid of some such turn the uncertainty in his face had become so the next thing an uncertainty in the very air three words of impatience the least bit loud some outbreak of what in the world are you up to and what do you mean any note of that sort would instantly have brought her low and this all the more that heaven knew she hadn t in any manner designed to be high it was such a trifle her small breach with custom or at any rate with his natural presumption that all magnitude of wonder had already had before one could deprecate the shadow of it the effect of a complication it had made for him some difference that she couldn t measure this meeting him at home and alone instead of elsewhere and with others and back and back it kept coming to her that the blankness he showed her before he was able to see might should she choose to insist on it have a meaning have as who should say an historic value beyond the importance of momentary expressions in general she had naturally had on the spot no ready notion of what he might want to see it was enough for a ready notion not to speak of a beating heart that he did see that he saw his wife in her own drawing room at the hour when she would most properly be there he hadn t in any way challenged her it was true and after those instants during which she now believed him to have been harbouring the impression of something unusually prepared and pointed in her attitude and array he had advanced upon her smiling and smiling and thus without hesitation at the last had taken her into his arms the hesitation had been at the first and she at present saw that he had surmounted it without her help she had given him no help for if on the one hand she couldn t speak for hesitation so on the other and especially as he didn t ask her she couldn t explain why she was agitated she had known it all the while down to her toes known it in his presence with fresh intensity and if he had uttered but a question it would have pressed in her the spring of recklessness it had been strange that the most natural thing of all to say to him should have had that appearance but she was more than ever conscious that any appearance she had would come round more or less straight to her father whose life was now so quiet on the basis accepted for it that any alteration of his consciousness even in the possible sense of enlivenment would make their precious equilibrium waver that was at the bottom of her mind that their equilibrium was everything and that it was practically precarious a matter of a hair s breadth for the loss of the balance it was the equilibrium or at all events her conscious fear about it that had brought her heart into her mouth and the same fear was on either side in the silent look she and amerigo had exchanged the happy balance that demanded this amount of consideration was truly thus as by its own confession a delicate matter but that her husband had also his habit of anxiety and his general caution only brought them after all more closely together it would have been most beautifully therefore in the name of the equilibrium and in that of her joy at their feeling so exactly the same about it that she might have spoken if she had permitted the truth on the subject of her behaviour to ring out on the subject of that poor little behaviour which was for the moment so very limited a case of eccentricity why why have i made this evening such a point of our not all dining together well because i ve all day been so wanting you alone that i finally couldn t bear it and that there didn t seem any great reason why i should try to that came to me funny as it may at first sound with all the things we ve so wonderfully got into the way of bearing for each other you ve seemed these last days i don t know what more absent than ever before too absent for us merely to go on so it s all very well and i perfectly see how beautiful it is all round but there comes a day when something snaps when the full cup filled to the very brim begins to flow over that s what has happened to my need of you the cup all day has been too full to carry so here i am with it spilling it over you and just for the reason that is the reason of my life after all i ve scarcely to explain that i m as much in love with you now as the first hour except that there are some hours which i know when they come because they almost frighten me that show me i m even more so they come of themselves and ah they ve been coming after all after all some such words as those were what didn t ring out yet it was as if even the unuttered sound had been quenched here in its own quaver it was where utterance would have broken down by its very weight if he had let it get so far without that extremity at the end of a moment he had taken in what he needed to take that his wife was testifying that she adored and missed and desired him after all after all since she put it so she was right that was what he had to respond to that was what from the moment that as has been said he saw he had to treat as the most pertinent thing possible he held her close and long in expression of their personal reunion this obviously was one way of doing so he rubbed his cheek tenderly and with a deep vague murmur against her face that side of her face she was not pressing to his breast that was not less obviously another way and there were ways enough in short for his extemporised ease for the good humour she was afterwards to find herself thinking of as his infinite tact this last was partly no doubt because the question of tact might be felt as having come up at the end of a quarter of an hour during which he had liberally talked and she had genially questioned he had told her of his day the happy thought of his roundabout journey with charlotte all their cathedral hunting adventure and how it had turned out rather more of an affair than they expected the moral of it was at any rate that he was tired verily and must have a bath and dress to which end she would kindly excuse him for the shortest time possible she was to remember afterwards something that had passed between them on this how he had looked for her during an instant at the door before going out how he had met her asking him in hesitation first then quickly in decision whether she couldn t help him by going up with him he had perhaps also for a moment hesitated but he had declined her offer and she was to preserve as i say the memory of the smile with which he had opined that at that rate they wouldn t dine till ten o clock and that he should go straighter and faster alone such things as i say were to come back to her they played through her full after sense like lights on the whole impression the subsequent parts of the experience were not to have blurred their distinctness one of these subsequent parts the first had been the not inconsiderable length to her later and more analytic consciousness of this second wait for her husband s reappearance she might certainly with the best will in the world had she gone up with him have been more in his way than not since people could really almost always hurry better without help than with it still she could actually hardly have made him take more time than he struck her taking though it must indeed be added that there was now in this much thinking little person s state of mind no mere crudity of impatience something had happened rapidly with the beautiful sight of him and with the drop of her fear of having annoyed him by making him go to and fro subsidence of the fearsome for maggie s spirit was always at first positive emergence of the sweet and it was long since anything had been so sweet to her as the particular quality suddenly given by her present emotion to the sense of possession xxvi amerigo was away from her again as she sat there as she walked there without him for she had with the difference of his presence in the house ceased to keep herself from moving about but the hour was filled nevertheless with the effect of his nearness and above all with the effect strange in an intimacy so established of an almost renewed vision of the facts of his aspect she had seen him last but five days since yet he had stood there before her as if restored from some far country some long voyage some combination of dangers or fatigues this unquenchable variety in his appeal to her interest what did it mean but that reduced to the flatness of mere statement she was married by good fortune to an altogether dazzling person that was an old old story but the truth of it shone out to her like the beauty of some family picture some mellow portrait of an ancestor that she might have been looking at almost in surprise after a long intermission the dazzling person was upstairs and she was down and there were moreover the other facts of the selection and decision that this demonstration of her own had required and of the constant care that the equilibrium involved but she had all the same never felt so absorbingly married so abjectly conscious of a master of her fate he could do what he would with her in fact what was actually happening was that he was actually doing it what he would what he really would only that quantity itself escaped perhaps in the brightness of the high harmony familiar naming and discussing it was enough of a recognition for her that whatever the thing he might desire he would always absolutely bring it off she knew at this moment without a question with the fullest surrender how he had brought off in her by scarce more than a single allusion a perfect flutter of tenderness if he had come back tired tired from his long day the exertion had been literally in her service and her father s they two had sat at home at peace the principino between them the complications of life kept down the bores sifted out the large ease of the home preserved because of the way the others held the field and braved the weather amerigo never complained any more than for that matter charlotte did but she seemed to see to night as she had never yet quite done that their business of social representation conceived as they conceived it beyond any conception of her own and conscientiously carried out was an affair of living always in harness she remembered fanny assingham s old judgment that friend s description of her father and herself as not living at all as not knowing what to do or what might be done for them and there came back to her with it an echo of the long talk they had had together one september day at fawns under the trees when she put before him this dictum of fanny s that occasion might have counted for them she had already often made the reflection as the first step in an existence more intelligently arranged it had been an hour from which the chain of causes and consequences was definitely traceable so many things and at the head of the list her father s marriage having appeared to her to flow from charlotte s visit to fawns and that event itself having flowed from the memorable talk but what perhaps most came out in the light of these concatenations was that it had been for all the world as if charlotte had been had in as the servants always said of extra help because they had thus suffered it to be pointed out to them that if their family coach lumbered and stuck the fault was in its lacking its complement of wheels having but three as they might say it had wanted another and what had charlotte done from the first but begin to act on the spot and ever so smoothly and beautifully as a fourth nothing had been immediately more manifest than the greater grace of the movement of the vehicle as to which for the completeness of her image maggie was now supremely to feel how every strain had been lightened for herself so far as she was one of the wheels she had but to keep in her place since the work was done for her she felt no weight and it wasn t too much to acknowledge that she had scarce to turn round she had a long pause before the fire during which she might have been fixing with intensity her projected vision have been conscious even of its taking an absurd fantastic shape she might have been watching the family coach pass and noting that somehow amerigo and charlotte were pulling it while she and her father were not so much as pushing they were seated inside together dandling the principino and holding him up to the windows to see and be seen like an infant positively royal so that the exertion was all with the others maggie found in this image a repeated challenge again and yet again she paused before the fire after which each time in the manner of one for whom a strong light has suddenly broken she gave herself to livelier movement she had seen herself at last in the picture she was studying suddenly jump from the coach whereupon frankly with the wonder of the sight her eyes opened wider and her heart stood still for a moment she looked at the person so acting as if this person were somebody else waiting with intensity to see what would follow the person had taken a decision which was evidently because an impulse long gathering had at last felt a sharpest pressure only how was the decision to be applied what in particular would the figure in the picture do she looked about her from the middle of the room under the force of this question as if there exactly were the field of action involved then as the door opened again she recognised whatever the action the form at any rate of a first opportunity her husband had reappeared he stood before her refreshed almost radiant quite reassuring dressed anointed fragrant ready above all for his dinner he smiled at her over the end of their delay it was as if her opportunity had depended on his look and now she saw that it was good there was still for the instant something in suspense but it passed more quickly than on his previous entrance he was already holding out his arms it was for hours and hours later on as if she had somehow been lifted aloft were floated and carried on some warm high tide beneath which stumbling blocks had sunk out of sight this came from her being again for the time in the enjoyment of confidence from her knowing as she believed what to do all the next day and all the next she appeared to herself to know it she had a plan and she rejoiced in her plan this consisted of the light that suddenly breaking into her restless reverie had marked the climax of that vigil it had come to her as a question what if i ve abandoned them you know what if i ve accepted too passively the funny form of our life there would be a process of her own by which she might do differently in respect to amerigo and charlotte a process quite independent of any process of theirs such a solution had but to rise before her to affect her to charm her with its simplicity an advantageous simplicity she had been stupid for so long not to have been struck by and the simplicity meanwhile seemed proved by the success that had already begun to attend her she had only had herself to do something to see how immediately it answered this consciousness of its having answered with her husband was the uplifting sustaining wave he had met her she so put it to herself met her with an effect of generosity and of gaiety in especial on his coming back to her ready for dinner which she wore in her breast as the token of an escape for them both from something not quite definite but clearly much less good even at that moment in fact her plan had begun to work she had been when he brightly reappeared in the act of plucking it out of the heart of her earnestness plucking it in the garden of thought as if it had been some full blown flower that she could present to him on the spot well it was the flower of participation and as that then and there she held it out to him putting straightway into execution the idea so needlessly so absurdly obscured of her sharing with him whatever the enjoyment the interest the experience might be and sharing also for that matter with charlotte she had thrown herself at dinner into every feature of the recent adventure of the companions letting him see without reserve that she wished to hear everything about it and making charlotte in particular charlotte s judgment of matcham charlotte s aspect her success there her effect traceably produced her clothes inimitably worn her cleverness gracefully displayed her social utility in fine brilliantly exemplified the subject of endless inquiry maggie s inquiry was most empathetic moreover for the whole happy thought of the cathedral hunt which she was so glad they had entertained and as to the pleasant results of which down to the cold beef and bread and cheese the queer old smell and the dirty table cloth at the inn amerigo was good humouredly responsive he had looked at her across the table more than once as if touched by the humility of this welcome offered to impressions at second hand the amusements the large freedoms only of others as if recognising in it something fairly exquisite and at the end while they were alone before she had rung for a servant he had renewed again his condonation of the little irregularity such as it was on which she had ventured they had risen together to come upstairs he had been talking at the last about some of the people at the very last of all about lady castledean and mr blint after which she had once more broken ground on the matter of the type of gloucester it brought her as he came round the table to join her yet another of his kind conscious stares one of the looks visibly beguiled but at the same time not invisibly puzzled with which he had already shown his sense of this charming grace of her curiosity it was as if he might for a moment be going to say you needn t pretend dearest quite so hard needn t think it necessary to care quite so much it was as if he stood there before her with some such easy intelligence some such intimate reassurance on his lips her answer would have been all ready that she wasn t in the least pretending and she looked up at him while he took her hand with the maintenance the real persistence of her lucid little plan in her eyes she wanted him to understand from that very moment that she was going to be with him again quite with them together as she doubtless hadn t been since the funny changes that was really all one could call them into which they had each as for the sake of the others too easily and too obligingly slipped they had taken too much for granted that their life together required as people in london said a special form which was very well so long as the form was kept only for the outside world and was made no more of among themselves than the pretty mould of an iced pudding or something of that sort into which to help yourself you didn t hesitate to break with the spoon so much as that she would with an opening have allowed herself furthermore to observe she wanted him to understand how her scheme embraced charlotte too so that if he had but uttered the acknowledgment she judged him on the point of making the acknowledgment of his catching at her brave little idea for their case she would have found herself as distinctly voluble almost to eloquence what befell however was that even while she thus waited she felt herself present at a process taking place rather deeper within him than the occasion on the whole appeared to require a process of weighing something in the balance of considering deciding dismissing he had guessed that she was there with an idea there in fact by reason of her idea only this oddly enough was what at the last stayed his words she was helped to these perceptions by his now looking at her still harder than he had yet done which really brought it to the turn of a hair for her that she didn t make sure his notion of her idea was the right one it was the turn of a hair because he had possession of her hands and was bending toward her ever so kindly as if to see to understand more or possibly give more she didn t know which and that had the effect of simply putting her as she would have said in his power she gave up let her idea go let everything go her one consciousness was that he was taking her again into his arms it was not till afterwards that she discriminated as to this felt how the act operated with him instead of the words he hadn t uttered operated in his view as probably better than any words as always better in fact at any time than anything her acceptance of it her response to it inevitable foredoomed came back to her later on as a virtual assent to the assumption he had thus made that there was really nothing such a demonstration didn t anticipate and didn t dispose of and that the spring acting within herself moreover might well have been beyond any other the impulse legitimately to provoke it it made for any issue the third time since his return that he had drawn her to his breast and at present holding her to his side as they left the room he kept her close for their moving into the hall and across it kept her for their slow return together to the apartments above he had been right overwhelmingly right as to the felicity of his tenderness and the degree of her sensibility but even while she felt these things sweep all others away she tasted of a sort of terror of the weakness they produced in her it was still for her that she had positively something to do and that she mustn t be weak for this must much rather be strong for many hours after none the less she remained weak if weak it was though holding fast indeed to the theory of her success since her agitated overture had been after all so unmistakably met she recovered soon enough on the whole the sense that this left her charlotte always to deal with charlotte who at any rate however she might meet overtures must meet them at the worst more or less differently of that inevitability of such other ranges of response as were open to charlotte maggie took the measure in approaching her on the morrow of her return from matcham with the same show of desire to hear all her story she wanted the whole picture from her as she had wanted it from her companion and promptly in eaton square whither without the prince she repaired almost ostentatiously for the purpose this purpose only she brought her repeatedly back to the subject both in her husband s presence and during several scraps of independent colloquy before her father instinctively maggie took the ground that his wish for interesting echoes would be not less than her own allowing that is for everything his wife would already have had to tell him for such passages between them as might have occurred since the evening before joining them after luncheon reaching them in her desire to proceed with the application of her idea before they had quitted the breakfast room the scene of their mid day meal she referred in her parent s presence to what she might have lost by delay and expressed the hope that there would be an anecdote or two left for her to pick up charlotte was dressed to go out and her husband it appeared rather positively prepared not to he had left the table but was seated near the fire with two or three of the morning papers and the residuum of the second and third posts on a stand beside him more even than the usual extravagance as maggie s glance made out of circulars catalogues advertisements announcements of sales foreign envelopes and foreign handwritings that were as unmistakable as foreign clothes charlotte at the window looking into the side street that abutted on the square might have been watching for their visitor s advent before withdrawing and in the light strange and coloured like that of a painted picture which fixed the impression for her objects took on values not hitherto so fully shown it was the effect of her quickened sensibility she knew herself again in presence of a problem in need of a solution for which she must intensely work that consciousness lately born in her had been taught the evening before to accept a temporary lapse but had quickly enough again with her getting out of her own house and her walking across half the town for she had come from portland place on foot found breath still in its lungs it exhaled this breath in a sigh faint and unheard her tribute while she stood there before speaking to realities looming through the golden mist that had already begun to be scattered the conditions facing her had yielded for the time to the golden mist had considerably melted away but there they were again definite and it was for the next quarter of an hour as if she could have counted them one by one on her fingers sharp to her above all was the renewed attestation of her father s comprehensive acceptances which she had so long regarded as of the same quality with her own but which so distinctly now she should have the complication of being obliged to deal with separately they had not yet struck her as absolutely extraordinary which had made for her lumping them with her own since her view of her own had but so lately begun to change though it instantly stood out for her that there was really no new judgment of them she should be able to show without attracting in some degree his attention without perhaps exciting his surprise and making thereby for the situation she shared with him some difference she was reminded and warned by the concrete image and for a minute charlotte s face immediately presented to her affected her as searching her own to see the reminder tell she had not less promptly kissed her stepmother and then had bent over her father from behind and laid her cheek upon him little amenities tantamount heretofore to an easy change of guard charlotte s own frequent though always cheerful term of comparison for this process of transfer maggie figured thus as the relieving sentry and so smoothly did use and custom work for them that her mate might even on this occasion after acceptance of the pass word have departed without irrelevant and in strictness unsoldierly gossip this was not none the less what happened inasmuch as if our young woman had been floated over her first impulse to break the existing charm at a stroke it yet took her but an instant to sound at any risk the note she had been privately practising if she had practised it the day before at dinner on amerigo she knew but the better how to begin for it with mrs verver and it immensely helped her for that matter to be able at once to speak of the prince as having done more to quicken than to soothe her curiosity frankly and gaily she had come to ask to ask what in their unusually prolonged campaign the two had achieved she had got out of her husband she admitted what she could but husbands were never the persons who answered such questions ideally he had only made her more curious and she had arrived early this way in order to miss as little as possible of charlotte s story wives papa she said are always much better reporters though i grant she added for charlotte that fathers are not much better than husbands he never she smiled tells me more than a tenth of what you tell him so i hope you haven t told him everything yet since in that case i shall probably have lost the best part of it maggie went she went she felt herself going she reminded herself of an actress who had been studying a part and rehearsing it but who suddenly on the stage before the footlights had begun to improvise to speak lines not in the text it was this very sense of the stage and the footlights that kept her up made her rise higher just as it was the sense of action that logically involved some platform action quite positively for the first time in her life or counting in the previous afternoon for the second the platform remained for three or four days thus sensibly under her feet and she had all the while with it the inspiration of quite remarkably of quite heroically improvising preparation and practice had come but a short way her part opened out and she invented from moment to moment what to say and to do she had but one rule of art to keep within bounds and not lose her head certainly she might see for a week how far that would take her she said to herself in her excitement that it was perfectly simple to bring about a difference touch by touch without letting either of the three and least of all her father so much as suspect her hand if they should suspect they would want a reason and the humiliating truth was that she wasn t ready with a reason not that is with what she would have called a reasonable one she thought of herself instinctively beautifully as having dealt all her life at her father s side and by his example only in reasonable reasons and what she would really have been most ashamed of would be to produce for him in this line some inferior substitute unless she were in a position to plead definitely that she was jealous she should be in no position to plead decently that she was dissatisfied this latter condition would be a necessary implication of the former without the former behind it it would have to fall to the ground so had the case wonderfully been arranged for her there was a card she could play but there was only one and to play it would be to end the game she felt herself as at the small square green table between the tall old silver candlesticks and the neatly arranged counters her father s playmate and partner and what it constantly came back to in her mind was that for her to ask a question to raise a doubt to reflect in any degree on the play of the others would be to break the charm the charm she had to call it since it kept her companion so constantly engaged so perpetually seated and so contentedly occupied to say anything at all would be in fine to have to say why she was jealous and she could in her private hours but stare long with suffused eyes at that impossibility by the end of a week the week that had begun especially with her morning hour in eaton square between her father and his wife her consciousness of being beautifully treated had become again verily greater than her consciousness of anything else and i must add moreover that she at last found herself rather oddly wondering what else as a consciousness could have been quite so overwhelming charlotte s response to the experiment of being more with her ought as she very well knew to have stamped the experiment with the feeling of success so that if the success itself seemed a boon less substantial than the original image of it it enjoyed thereby a certain analogy with our young woman s aftertaste of amerigo s own determined demonstrations maggie was to have retained for that matter more than one aftertaste and if i have spoken of the impressions fixed in her as soon as she had so insidiously taken the field a definite note must be made of her perception during those moments of charlotte s prompt uncertainty she had shown no doubt she couldn t not have shown that she had arrived with an idea quite exactly as she had shown her husband the night before that she was awaiting him with a sentiment this analogy in the two situations was to keep up for her the remembrance of a kinship of expression in the two faces in respect to which all she as yet professed to herself was that she had affected them or at any rate the sensibility each of them so admirably covered in the same way to make the comparison at all was for maggie to return to it often to brood upon it to extract from it the last dregs of its interest to play with it in short nervously vaguely incessantly as she might have played with a medallion containing on either side a cherished little portrait and suspended round her neck by a gold chain of a firm fineness that no effort would ever snap the miniatures were back to back but she saw them forever face to face and when she looked from one to the other she found in charlotte s eyes the gleam of the momentary what does she really want that had come and gone for her in the prince s so again she saw the other light the light touched into a glow both in portland place and in eaton square as soon as she had betrayed that she wanted no harm wanted no greater harm of charlotte that is than to take in that she meant to go out with her she had been present at that process as personally as she might have been present at some other domestic incident the hanging of a new picture say or the fitting of the principino with his first little trousers she remained present accordingly all the week so charmingly and systematically did mrs verver now welcome her company charlotte had but wanted the hint and what was it but the hint after all that during the so subdued but so ineffaceable passage in the breakfast room she had seen her take it had been taken moreover not with resignation not with qualifications or reserves however bland it had been taken with avidity with gratitude with a grace of gentleness that supplanted explanations the very liberality of this accommodation might indeed have appeared in the event to give its own account of the matter as if it had fairly written the princess down as a person of variations and had accordingly conformed but to a rule of tact in accepting these caprices for law the caprice actually prevailing happened to be that the advent of one of the ladies anywhere should till the fit had changed become the sign unfailingly of the advent of the other and it was emblazoned in rich colour on the bright face of this period that mrs verver only wished to know on any occasion what was expected of her only held herself there for instructions in order even to better them if possible the two young women while the passage lasted became again very much the companions of other days the days of charlotte s prolonged visits to the admiring and bountiful maggie the days when equality of condition for them had been all the result of the latter s native vagueness about her own advantages the earlier elements flushed into life again the frequency the intimacy the high pitch of accompanying expression appreciation endearment confidence the rarer charm produced in each by this active contribution to the felicity of the other all enhanced furthermore enhanced or qualified who should say which by a new note of diplomacy almost of anxiety just sensible on charlotte s part in particular of intensity of observance in the matter of appeal and response in the matter of making sure the princess might be disposed or gratified that resembled an attempt to play again with more refinement at disparity of relation charlotte s attitude had in short its moments of flowering into pretty excesses of civility self effacements in the presence of others sudden little formalisms of suggestion and recognition that might have represented her sense of the duty of not losing sight of a social distinction this impression came out most for maggie when in their easier intervals they had only themselves to regard and when her companion s inveteracy of never passing first of not sitting till she was seated of not interrupting till she appeared to give leave of not forgetting too familiarly that in addition to being important she was also sensitive had the effect of throwing over their intercourse a kind of silver tissue of decorum it hung there above them like a canopy of state a reminder that though the lady in waiting was an established favourite safe in her position a little queen however good natured was always a little queen and might with small warning remember it and yet another of these concomitants of feverish success all the while was the perception that in another quarter too things were being made easy charlotte s alacrity in meeting her had in one sense operated slightly overmuch as an intervention it had begun to reabsorb her at the very hour of her husband s showing her that to be all there as the phrase was he likewise only required as one of the other phrases was too the straight tip she had heard him talk about the straight tip in his moods of amusement at english slang in his remarkable displays of assimilative power power worthy of better causes and higher inspirations and he had taken it from her at need in a way that certainly in the first glow of relief had made her brief interval seem large then however immediately and even though superficially there had declared itself a readjustment of relations to which she was once more practically a little sacrificed i must do everything she had said without letting papa see what i do at least till it s done but she scarce knew how she proposed even for the next few days to blind or beguile this participant in her life what had in fact promptly enough happened she presently recognised was that if her stepmother had beautifully taken possession of her and if she had virtually been rather snatched again thereby from her husband s side so on the other hand this had with as little delay entailed some very charming assistance for her in eaton square when she went home with charlotte from whatever happy demonstration for the benefit of the world in which they supposed themselves to live that there was no smallest reason why their closer association shouldn t be public and acclaimed at these times she regularly found that amerigo had come either to sit with his father in law in the absence of the ladies or to make on his side precisely some such display of the easy working of the family life as would represent the equivalent of her excursions with charlotte under this particular impression it was that everything in maggie most melted and went to pieces every thing that is that belonged to her disposition to challenge the perfection of their common state it divided them again that was true this particular turn of the tide cut them up afresh into pairs and parties quite as if a sense for the equilibrium was what between them all had most power of insistence quite as if amerigo himself were all the while at bottom equally thinking of it and watching it but as against that he was making her father not miss her and he could have rendered neither of them a more excellent service he was acting in short on a cue the cue given him by observation it had been enough for him to see the shade of change in her behaviour his instinct for relations the most exquisite conceivable prompted him immediately to meet and match the difference to play somehow into its hands that was what it was she renewedly felt to have married a man who was sublimely a gentleman so that in spite of her not wanting to translate all their delicacies into the grossness of discussion she yet found again and again in portland place moments for saying if i didn t love you you know for yourself i should still love you for him he looked at her after such speeches as charlotte looked in eaton square when she called her attention to his benevolence through the dimness of the almost musing smile that took account of her extravagance harmless though it might be as a tendency to reckon with but my poor child charlotte might under this pressure have been on the point of replying that s the way nice people are all round so that why should one be surprised about it we re all nice together as why shouldn t we be if we hadn t been we wouldn t have gone far and i consider that we ve gone very far indeed why should you take on as if you weren t a perfect dear yourself capable of all the sweetest things as if you hadn t in fact grown up in an atmosphere the atmosphere of all the good things that i recognised even of old as soon as i came near you and that you ve allowed me now between you to make so blessedly my own mrs verver might in fact have but just failed to make another point a point charmingly natural to her as a grateful and irreproachable wife it isn t a bit wonderful i may also remind you that your husband should find when opportunity permits worse things to do than to go about with mine i happen love to appreciate my husband i happen perfectly to understand that his acquaintance should be cultivated and his company enjoyed some such happily provoked remarks as these from charlotte at the other house had been in the air but we have seen how there was also in the air for our young woman as an emanation from the same source a distilled difference of which the very principle was to keep down objections and retorts that impression came back it had its hours of doing so and it may interest us on the ground of its having prompted in maggie a final reflection a reflection out of the heart of which a light flashed for her like a great flower grown in a night as soon as this light had spread a little it produced in some quarters a surprising distinctness made her of a sudden ask herself why there should have been even for three days the least obscurity the perfection of her success decidedly was like some strange shore to which she had been noiselessly ferried and where with a start she found herself quaking at the thought that the boat might have put off again and left her the word for it the word that flashed the light was that they were treating her that they were proceeding with her and for that matter with her father by a plan that was the exact counterpart of her own it was not from her that they took their cue but and this was what in particular made her sit up from each other and with a depth of unanimity an exact coincidence of inspiration that when once her attention had begun to fix it struck her as staring out at her in recovered identities of behaviour expression and tone they had a view of her situation and of the possible forms her own consciousness of it might take a view determined by the change of attitude they had had ever so subtly to recognise in her on their return from matcham they had had to read into this small and all but suppressed variation a mute comment on they didn t quite know what and it now arched over the princess s head like a vault of bold span that important communication between them on the subject couldn t have failed of being immediate this new perception bristled for her as we have said with odd intimations but questions unanswered played in and out of it as well the question for instance of why such promptitude of harmony should have been important ah when she began to recover piece by piece the process became lively she might have been picking small shining diamonds out of the sweepings of her ordered house she bent in this pursuit over her dust bin she challenged to the last grain the refuse of her innocent economy then it was that the dismissed vision of amerigo that evening in arrest at the door of her salottino while her eyes from her placed chair took him in then it was that this immense little memory gave out its full power since the question was of doors she had afterwards she now saw shut it out she had responsibly shut in as we have understood shut in there with her sentient self only the fact of his reappearance and the plenitude of his presence these things had been testimony after all to supersede any other for on the spot even while she looked the warmly washing wave had travelled far up the strand she had subsequently lived for hours she couldn t count under the dizzying smothering welter positively in submarine depths where everything came to her through walls of emerald and mother of pearl though indeed she had got her head above them for breath when face to face with charlotte again on the morrow in eaton square meanwhile none the less as was so apparent the prior the prime impression had remained in the manner of a spying servant on the other side of the barred threshold a witness availing himself in time of the lightest pretext to re enter it was as if he had found this pretext in her observed necessity of comparing comparing the obvious common elements in her husband s and her stepmother s ways of now taking her with or without her witness at any rate she was led by comparison to a sense of the quantity of earnest intention operating and operating so harmoniously between her companions and it was in the mitigated midnight of these approximations that she had made out the promise of her dawn it was a worked out scheme for their not wounding her for their behaving to her quite nobly to which each had in some winning way induced the other to contribute and which therefore so far as that went proved that she had become with them a subject of intimate study quickly quickly on a certain alarm taken eagerly and anxiously before they should without knowing it wound her they had signalled from house to house their clever idea the idea by which for all these days her own idea had been profiting they had built her in with their purpose which was why above her a vault seemed more heavily to arch so that she sat there in the solid chamber of her helplessness as in a bath of benevolence artfully prepared for her over the brim of which she could but just manage to see by stretching her neck baths of benevolence were very well but at least unless one were a patient of some sort a nervous eccentric or a lost child one was usually not so immersed save by one s request it wasn t in the least what she had requested she had flapped her little wings as a symbol of desired flight not merely as a plea for a more gilded cage and an extra allowance of lumps of sugar above all she hadn t complained not by the quaver of a syllable so what wound in particular had she shown her fear of receiving what wound had she received as to which she had exchanged the least word with them if she had ever whined or moped they might have had some reason but she would be hanged she conversed with herself in strong language if she had been from beginning to end anything but pliable and mild it all came back in consequence to some required process of their own a process operating quite positively as a precaution and a policy they had got her into the bath and for consistency with themselves which was with each other must keep her there in that condition she wouldn t interfere with the policy which was established which was arranged her thought over this arrived at a great intensity had indeed its pauses and timidities but always to take afterwards a further and lighter spring the ground was well nigh covered by the time she had made out her husband and his colleague as directly interested in preventing her freedom of movement policy or no policy it was they themselves who were arranged she must be kept in position so as not to disarrange them it fitted immensely together the whole thing as soon as she could give them a motive for strangely as it had by this time begun to appear to herself she had hitherto not imagined them sustained by an ideal distinguishably different from her own of course they were arranged all four arranged but what had the basis of their life been precisely but that they were arranged together amerigo and charlotte were arranged together but she to confine the matter only to herself was arranged apart it rushed over her the full sense of all this with quite another rush from that of the breaking wave of ten days before and as her father himself seemed not to meet the vaguely clutching hand with which during the first shock of complete perception she tried to steady herself she felt very much alone xxvii there had been from far back that is from the christmas time on a plan that the parent and the child should do something lovely together and they had recurred to it on occasion nursed it and brought it up theoretically though without as yet quite allowing it to put its feet to the ground the most it had done was to try a few steps on the drawing room carpet with much attendance on either side much holding up and guarding much anticipation in fine of awkwardness or accident their companions by the same token had constantly assisted at the performance following the experiment with sympathy and gaiety and never so full of applause maggie now made out for herself as when the infant project had kicked its little legs most wildly kicked them for all the world across the channel and half the continent kicked them over the pyrenees and innocently crowed out some rich spanish name she asked herself at present if it had been a real belief that they were but wanting for some such adventure to snatch their moment whether either had at any instant seen it as workable save in the form of a toy to dangle before the other that they should take flight without wife or husband for one more look before they died at the madrid pictures as well as for a drop of further weak delay in respect to three or four possible prizes privately offered rarities of the first water responsibly reported on and profusely photographed still patiently awaiting their noiseless arrival in retreats to which the clue had not otherwise been given away the vision dallied with during the duskier days in eaton square had stretched to the span of three or four weeks of springtime for the total adventure three or four weeks in the very spirit after all of their regular life as their regular life had been persisting full of shared mornings afternoons evenings walks drives looks in at old places on vague chances full also in especial of that purchased social ease the sense of the comfort and credit of their house which had essentially the perfection of something paid for but which came on the whole so cheap that it might have been felt as costing as costing the parent and child nothing it was for maggie to wonder at present if she had been sincere about their going to ask herself whether she would have stuck to their plan even if nothing had happened her view of the impossibility of sticking to it now may give us the measure of her sense that everything had happened a difference had been made in her relation to each of her companions and what it compelled her to say to herself was that to behave as she might have behaved before would be to act for amerigo and charlotte with the highest hypocrisy she saw in these days that a journey abroad with her father would more than anything else have amounted on his part and her own to a last expression of an ecstasy of confidence and that the charm of the idea in fact had been in some such sublimity day after day she put off the moment of speaking as she inwardly and very comprehensively called it speaking that is to her father and all the more that she was ridden by a strange suspense as to his himself breaking silence she gave him time gave him during several days that morning that noon that night and the next and the next and the next even made up her mind that if he stood off longer it would be proof conclusive that he too wasn t at peace they would then have been all successfully throwing dust in each other s eyes and it would be at last as if they must turn away their faces since the silver mist that protected them had begun to grow sensibly thin finally at the end of april she decided that if he should say nothing for another period of twenty four hours she must take it as showing that they were in her private phraseology lost so little possible sincerity could there be in pretending to care for a journey to spain at the approach of a summer that already promised to be hot such a proposal on his lips such an extravagance of optimism would be his way of being consistent for that he didn t really want to move or to move further at the worst than back to fawns again could only signify that he wasn t at heart contented what he wanted at any rate and what he didn t want were in the event put to the proof for maggie just in time to give her a fresh wind she had been dining with her husband in eaton square on the occasion of hospitality offered by mr and mrs verver to lord and lady castledean the propriety of some demonstration of this sort had been for many days before our group the question reduced to the mere issue of which of the two houses should first take the field the issue had been easily settled in the manner of every issue referred in any degree to amerigo and charlotte the initiative obviously belonged to mrs verver who had gone to matcham while maggie had stayed away and the evening in eaton square might have passed for a demonstration all the more personal that the dinner had been planned on intimate lines six other guests only in addition to the host and the hostess of matcham made up the company and each of these persons had for maggie the interest of an attested connection with the easter revels at that visionary house their common memory of an occasion that had clearly left behind it an ineffaceable charm this air of beatific reference less subdued in the others than in amerigo and charlotte lent them together an inscrutable comradeship against which the young woman s imagination broke in a small vain wave it wasn t that she wished she had been of the remembered party and possessed herself of its secrets for she didn t care about its secrets she could concern herself at present absolutely with no secret but her own what occurred was simply that she became aware at a stroke of the quantity of further nourishment required by her own and of the amount of it she might somehow extract from these people whereby she rose of a sudden to the desire to possess and use them even to the extent of braving of fairly defying of directly exploiting of possibly quite enjoying under cover of an evil duplicity the felt element of curiosity with which they regarded her once she was conscious of the flitting wing of this last impression the perception irresistible that she was something for their queer experience just as they were something for hers there was no limit to her conceived design of not letting them escape she went and went again to night after her start was taken went positively as she had felt herself going three weeks before on the morning when the vision of her father and his wife awaiting her together in the breakfast room had been so determinant in this other scene it was lady castledean who was determinant who kindled the light or at all events the heat and who acted on the nerves lady castledean whom she knew she so oddly didn t like in spite of reasons upon reasons the biggest diamonds on the yellowest hair the longest lashes on the prettiest falsest eyes the oldest lace on the most violet velvet the rightest manner on the wrongest assumption her ladyship s assumption was that she kept at every moment of her life every advantage it made her beautifully soft very nearly generous so she didn t distinguish the little protuberant eyes of smaller social insects often endowed with such a range from the other decorative spots on their bodies and wings maggie had liked in london and in the world at large so many more people than she had thought it right to fear right even to so much as judge that it positively quickened her fever to have to recognise in this case such a lapse of all the sequences it was only that a charming clever woman wondered about her that is wondered about her as amerigo s wife and wondered moreover with the intention of kindness and the spontaneity almost of surprise the point of view that one was what she read in their free contemplation in that of the whole eight there was something in amerigo to be explained and she was passed about all tenderly and expertly like a dressed doll held in the right manner by its firmly stuffed middle for the account she could give she might have been made to give it by pressure of her stomach she might have been expected to articulate with a rare imitation of nature oh yes i m here all the while i m also in my way a solid little fact and i cost originally a great deal of money cost that is my father for my outfit and let in my husband for an amount of pains toward my training that money would scarce represent well she would meet them in some such way and she translated her idea into action after dinner before they dispersed by engaging them all unconventionally almost violently to dine with her in portland place just as they were if they didn t mind the same party which was the party she wanted oh she was going she was going she could feel it afresh it was a good deal as if she had sneezed ten times or had suddenly burst into a comic song there were breaks in the connection as there would be hitches in the process she didn t wholly see yet what they would do for her nor quite how herself she should handle them but she was dancing up and down beneath her propriety with the thought that she had at least begun something she so fairly liked to feel that she was a point for convergence of wonder it wasn t after all either that their wonder so much signified that of the cornered six whom it glimmered before her that she might still live to drive about like a flock of sheep the intensity of her consciousness its sharpest savour was in the theory of her having diverted having as they said captured the attention of amerigo and charlotte at neither of whom all the while did she so much as once look she had pitched them in with the six for that matter so far as they themselves were concerned they had dropped for the succession of minutes out of contact with their function had in short startled and impressed abandoned their post they re paralysed they re paralysed she commented deep within so much it helped her own apprehension to hang together that they should suddenly lose their bearings her grasp of appearances was thus out of proportion to her view of causes but it came to her then and there that if she could only get the facts of appearance straight only jam them down into their place the reasons lurking behind them kept uncertain for the eyes by their wavering and shifting wouldn t perhaps be able to help showing it wasn t of course that the prince and mrs verver marvelled to see her civil to their friends it was rather precisely that civil was just what she wasn t she had so departed from any such custom of delicate approach approach by the permitted note the suggested if the accepted vagueness as would enable the people in question to put her off if they wished and the profit of her plan the effect of the violence she was willing to let it go for was exactly in their being the people in question people she had seemed to be rather shy of before and for whom she suddenly opened her mouth so wide later on we may add with the ground soon covered by her agitated but resolute step it was to cease to matter what people they were or weren t but meanwhile the particular sense of them that she had taken home to night had done her the service of seeming to break the ice where that formation was thickest still more unexpectedly the service might have been the same for her father inasmuch as immediately when everyone had gone he did exactly what she had been waiting for and despairing of and did it as he did everything with a simplicity that left any purpose of sounding him deeper of drawing him out further of going in his own frequent phrase behind what he said nothing whatever to do he brought it out straight made it bravely and beautifully irrelevant save for the plea of what they should lose by breaking the charm i guess we won t go down there after all will we mag just when it s getting so pleasant here that was all with nothing to lead up to it but it was done for her at a stroke and done not less more rather for amerigo and charlotte on whom the immediate effect as she secretly as she almost breathlessly measured it was prodigious everything now so fitted for her to everything else that she could feel the effect as prodigious even while sticking to her policy of giving the pair no look there were thus some five wonderful minutes during which they loomed to her sightless eyes on either side of her larger than they had ever loomed before larger than life larger than thought larger than any danger or any safety there was thus a space of time in fine fairly vertiginous for her during which she took no more account of them than if they were not in the room she had never never treated them in any such way not even just now when she had plied her art upon the matcham band her present manner was an intenser exclusion and the air was charged with their silence while she talked with her other companion as if she had nothing but him to consider he had given her the note amazingly by his allusion to the pleasantness that of such an occasion as his successful dinner which might figure as their bribe for renouncing so that it was all as if they were speaking selfishly counting on a repetition of just such extensions of experience maggie achieved accordingly an act of unprecedented energy threw herself into her father s presence as by the absolute consistency with which she held his eyes saying to herself at the same time that she smiled and talked and inaugurated her system what does he mean by it that s the question what does he mean but studying again all the signs in him that recent anxiety had made familiar and counting the stricken minutes on the part of the others it was in their silence that the others loomed as she felt she had had no measure she afterwards knew of this duration but it drew out and out really to what would have been called in simpler conditions awkwardness as if she herself were stretching the cord ten minutes later however in the homeward carriage to which her husband cutting delay short had proceeded at the first announcement ten minutes later she was to stretch it almost to breaking the prince had permitted her to linger much less before his move to the door than they usually lingered at the gossiping close of such evenings which she all responsive took for a sign of his impatience to modify for her the odd effect of his not having and of charlotte s not having instantly acclaimed the issue of the question debated or more exactly settled before them he had had time to become aware of this possible impression in her and his virtually urging her into the carriage was connected with his feeling that he must take action on the new ground a certain ambiguity in her would absolutely have tormented him but he had already found something to soothe and correct as to which she had on her side a shrewd notion of what it would be she was herself for that matter prepared and she was of a truth as she took her seat in the brougham amazed at her preparation it allowed her scarce an interval she brought it straight out i was certain that was what father would say if i should leave him alone i have been leaving him alone and you see the effect he hates now to move he likes too much to be with us but if you see the effect she felt herself magnificently keeping it up perhaps you don t see the cause the cause my dear is too lovely her husband on taking his place beside her had during a minute or two for her watching sense neither said nor done anything he had been for that sense as if thinking waiting deciding yet it was still before he spoke that he as she felt it to be definitely acted he put his arm round her and drew her close indulged in the demonstration the long firm embrace by his single arm the infinite pressure of her whole person to his own that such opportunities had so often suggested and prescribed held accordingly and as she could but too intimately feel exquisitely solicited she had said the thing she was intending and desiring to say and as to which she felt even more than she felt anything else that whatever he might do she mustn t be irresponsible yes she was in his exerted grasp and she knew what that was but she was at the same time in the grasp of her conceived responsibility and the extraordinary thing was that of the two intensities the second was presently to become the sharper he took his time for it meanwhile but he met her speech after a fashion the cause of your father s deciding not to go yes and of my having wanted to let it act for him quietly i mean without my insistence she had in her compressed state another pause and it made her feel as if she were immensely resisting strange enough was this sense for her and altogether new the sense of possessing by miraculous help some advantage that absolutely then and there in the carriage as they rolled she might either give up or keep strange inexpressibly strange so distinctly she saw that if she did give it up she should somehow give up everything for ever and what her husband s grasp really meant as her very bones registered was that she should give it up it was exactly for this that he had resorted to unfailing magic he knew how to resort to it he could be on occasion as she had lately more than ever learned so munificent a lover all of which was precisely a part of the character she had never ceased to regard in him as princely a part of his large and beautiful ease his genius for charm for intercourse for expression for life she should have but to lay her head back on his shoulder with a certain movement to make it definite for him that she didn t resist to this as they went every throb of her consciousness prompted her every throb that is but one the throb of her deeper need to know where she really was by the time she had uttered the rest of her idea therefore she was still keeping her head and intending to keep it though she was also staring out of the carriage window with eyes into which the tears of suffered pain had risen indistinguishable perhaps happily in the dusk she was making an effort that horribly hurt her and as she couldn t cry out her eyes swam in her silence with them all the same through the square opening beside her through the grey panorama of the london night she achieved the feat of not losing sight of what she wanted and her lips helped and protected her by being able to be gay it s not to leave you my dear for that he ll give up anything just as he would go off anywhere i think you know if you would go with him i mean you and he alone maggie pursued with her gaze out of her window for which amerigo s answer again took him a moment ah the dear old boy you would like me to propose him something well if you think you could bear it and leave the prince asked you and charlotte alone why not maggie had also to wait a minute but when she spoke it came clear why shouldn t charlotte be just one of my reasons my not liking to leave her she has always been so good so perfect to me but never so wonderfully as just now we have somehow been more together thinking for the time almost only of each other it has been quite as in old days and she proceeded consummately for she felt it as consummate it s as if we had been missing each other had got a little apart though going on so side by side but the good moments if one only waits for them she hastened to add come round of themselves moreover you ve seen for yourself since you ve made it up so to father feeling for yourself in your beautiful way every difference every air that blows not having to be told or pushed only being perfect to live with through your habit of kindness and your exquisite instincts but of course you ve seen all the while that both he and i have deeply felt how you ve managed managed that he hasn t been too much alone and that i on my side haven t appeared to what you might call neglect him this is always she continued what i can never bless you enough for of all the good things you ve done for me you ve never done anything better she went on explaining as for the pleasure of explaining even though knowing he must recognise as a part of his easy way too her description of his large liberality your taking the child down yourself those days and your coming each time to bring him away nothing in the world nothing you could have invented would have kept father more under the charm besides you know how you ve always suited him and how you ve always so beautifully let it seem to him that he suits you only it has been these last weeks as if you wished just in order to please him to remind him of it afresh so there it is she wound up it s your doing you ve produced your effect that of his wanting not to be even for a month or two where you re not he doesn t want to bother or bore you that i think you know he never has done and if you ll only give me time i ll come round again to making it my care as always that he shan t but he can t bear you out of his sight she had kept it up and up filling it out crowding it in and all really without difficulty for it was every word of it thanks to a long evolution of feeling what she had been primed to the brim with she made the picture forced it upon him hung it before him remembering happily how he had gone so far one day supported by the principino as to propose the zoo in eaton square to carry with him there on the spot under this pleasant inspiration both his elder and his younger companion with the latter of whom he had taken the tone that they were introducing granddaddy granddaddy nervous and rather funking it to lions and tigers more or less at large touch by touch she thus dropped into her husband s silence the truth about his good nature and his good manners and it was this demonstration of his virtue precisely that added to the strangeness even for herself of her failing as yet to yield to him it would be a question but of the most trivial act of surrender the vibration of a nerve the mere movement of a muscle but the act grew important between them just through her doing perceptibly nothing nothing but talk in the very tone that would naturally have swept her into tenderness she knew more and more every lapsing minute taught her how he might by a single rightness make her cease to watch him that rightness a million miles removed from the queer actual falling so short which would consist of his breaking out to her diviningly indulgently with the last happy inconsequence come away with me somewhere you and then we needn t think we needn t even talk of anything of anyone else five words like that would answer her would break her utterly down but they were the only ones that would so serve she waited for them and there was a supreme instant when by the testimony of all the rest of him she seemed to feel them in his heart and on his lips only they didn t sound and as that made her wait again so it made her more intensely watch this in turn showed her that he too watched and waited and how much he had expected something that he now felt wouldn t come yes it wouldn t come if he didn t answer her if he but said the wrong things instead of the right if he could say the right everything would come it hung by a hair that everything might crystallise for their recovered happiness at his touch this possibility glowed at her however for fifty seconds only then to turn cold and as it fell away from her she felt the chill of reality and knew again all but pressed to his heart and with his breath upon her cheek the slim rigour of her attitude a rigour beyond that of her natural being they had silences at last that were almost crudities of mutual resistance silences that persisted through his felt effort to treat her recurrence to the part he had lately played to interpret all the sweetness of her so talking to him as a manner of making love to him ah it was no such manner heaven knew for maggie she could make love if this had been in question better than that on top of which it came to her presently to say keeping in with what she had already spoken except of course that for the question of going off somewhere he d go readily quite delightedly with you i verily believe he d like to have you for a while to himself do you mean he thinks of proposing it the prince after a moment sounded oh no he doesn t ask as you must so often have seen but i believe he d go like a shot as you say if you were to suggest it it had the air she knew of a kind of condition made and she had asked herself while she spoke if it wouldn t cause his arm to let her go the fact that it didn t suggested to her that she had made him of a sudden still more intensely think think with such concentration that he could do but one thing at once and it was precisely as if the concentration had the next moment been proved in him he took a turn inconsistent with the superficial impression a jump that made light of their approach to gravity and represented for her the need in him to gain time that she made out was his drawback that the warning from her had come to him and had come to charlotte after all too suddenly that they were in face of it rearranging that they had to rearrange was all before her again yet to do as they would like they must enjoy a snatch longer or shorter of recovered independence amerigo for the instant was but doing as he didn t like and it was as if she were watching his effort without disguise what s your father s idea this year then about fawns will he go at whitsuntide and will he then stay on maggie went through the form of thought he will really do i imagine as he has in so many ways so often done before do whatever may seem most agreeable to yourself and there s of course always charlotte to be considered only their going early to fawns if they do go she said needn t in the least entail your and my going ah amerigo echoed it needn t in the least entail your and my going we can do as we like what they may do needn t trouble us since they re by good fortune perfectly happy together oh the prince returned your father s never so happy as with you near him to enjoy his being so well i may enjoy it said maggie but i m not the cause of it you re the cause her husband declared of the greater part of everything that s good among us but she received this tribute in silence and the next moment he pursued if mrs verver has arrears of time with you to make up as you say she ll scarcely do it or you scarcely will by our cutting your and my cutting too loose i see what you mean maggie mused he let her for a little to give her attention to it after which shall i just quite of a sudden he asked propose him a journey maggie hesitated but she brought forth the fruit of reflection it would have the merit that charlotte then would be with me with me i mean so much more also that i shouldn t by choosing such a time for going away seem unconscious and ungrateful seem not to respond seem in fact rather to wish to shake her off i should respond on the contrary very markedly by being here alone with her for a month and would you like to be here alone with her for a month i could do with it beautifully or we might even she said quite gaily go together down to fawns you could be so very content without me the prince presently inquired yes my own dear if you could be content for a while with father that would keep me up i might for the time she went on go to stay there with charlotte or better still she might come to portland place oho said the prince with cheerful vagueness i should feel you see she continued that the two of us were showing the same sort of kindness amerigo thought the two of us charlotte and i maggie again hesitated you and i darling i see i see he promptly took it in and what reason shall i give give i mean your father for asking him to go off why the very simplest if you conscientiously can the desire said maggie to be agreeable to him just that only something in this reply made her husband again reflect conscientiously why shouldn t i conscientiously it wouldn t by your own contention he developed represent any surprise for him i must strike him sufficiently as at the worst the last person in the world to wish to do anything to hurt him ah there it was again for maggie the note already sounded the note of the felt need of not working harm why this precautionary view she asked herself afresh when her father had complained at the very least as little as herself with their stillness together so perfect what had suggested so around them the attitude of sparing them her inner vision fixed it once more this attitude saw it in the others as vivid and concrete extended it straight from her companion to charlotte before she was well aware accordingly she had echoed in this intensity of thought amerigo s last words you re the last person in the world to wish to do anything to hurt him she heard herself heard her tone after she had spoken and heard it the more that for a minute after she felt her husband s eyes on her face very close too close for her to see him he was looking at her because he was struck and looking hard though his answer when it came was straight enough why isn t that just what we have been talking about that i ve affected you as fairly studying his comfort and his pleasure he might show his sense of it the prince went on by proposing to me an excursion and you would go with him maggie immediately asked he hung fire but an instant per dio she also had her pause but she broke it since gaiety was in the air with an intense smile you can say that safely because the proposal s one that of his own motion he won t make she couldn t have narrated afterwards and in fact was at a loss to tell herself by what transition what rather marked abruptness of change in their personal relation their drive came to its end with a kind of interval established almost confessed to between them she felt it in the tone with which he repeated after her safely safely as regards being thrown with him perhaps after all in such a case too long he s a person to think you might easily feel yourself to be so it won t maggie said come from father he s too modest their eyes continued to meet on it from corner to corner of the brougham oh your modesty between you but he still smiled for it so that unless i insist we shall simply go on as we are well we re going on beautifully he answered though by no means with the effect it would have had if their mute transaction that of attempted capture and achieved escape had not taken place as maggie said nothing none the less to gainsay his remark it was open to him to find himself the next moment conscious of still another idea i wonder if it would do i mean for me to break in to break in between your father and his wife but there would be a way he said we can make charlotte ask him and then as maggie herself now wondered echoing it again we can suggest to her to suggest to him that he shall let me take him off oh said maggie then if he asks her why i so suddenly break out she ll be able to tell him the reason they were stopping and the footman who had alighted had rung at the house door that you think it would be so charming that i think it would be so charming that we ve persuaded her will be convincing i see maggie went on while the footman came back to let them out i see she said again though she felt a little disconcerted what she really saw of a sudden was that her stepmother might report her as above all concerned for the proposal and this brought her back her need that her father shouldn t think her concerned in any degree for anything she alighted the next instant with a slight sense of defeat her husband to let her out had passed before her and a little in advance he awaited her on the edge of the low terrace a step high that preceded their open entrance on either side of which one of their servants stood the sense of a life tremendously ordered and fixed rose before her and there was something in amerigo s very face while his eyes again met her own through the dusky lamplight that was like a conscious reminder of it he had answered her just before distinctly and it appeared to leave her nothing to say it was almost as if having planned for the last word she saw him himself enjoying it it was almost as if in the strangest way in the world he were paying her back by the production of a small pang that of a new uneasiness for the way she had slipped from him during their drive xxviii maggie s new uneasiness might have had time to drop inasmuch as she not only was conscious during several days that followed of no fresh indication for it to feed on but was even struck in quite another way with an augmentation of the symptoms of that difference she had taken it into her head to work for she recognised by the end of a week that if she had been in a manner caught up her father had been not less so with the effect of her husband s and his wife s closing in together round them and of their all having suddenly begun as a party of four to lead a life gregarious and from that reason almost hilarious so far as the easy sound of it went as never before it might have been an accident and a mere coincidence so at least she said to herself at first but a dozen chances that furthered the whole appearance had risen to the surface pleasant pretexts oh certainly pleasant as pleasant as amerigo in particular could make them for associated undertakings quite for shared adventures for its always turning out amusingly that they wanted to do very much the same thing at the same time and in the same way funny all this was to some extent in the light of the fact that the father and daughter for so long had expressed so few positive desires yet it would be sufficiently natural that if amerigo and charlotte had at last got a little tired of each other s company they should find their relief not so much in sinking to the rather low level of their companions as in wishing to pull the latter into the train in which they so constantly moved we re in the train maggie mutely reflected after the dinner in eaton square with lady castledean we ve suddenly waked up in it and found ourselves rushing along very much as if we had been put in during sleep shoved like a pair of labelled boxes into the van and since i wanted to go i m certainly going she might have added i m moving without trouble they re doing it all for us it s wonderful how they understand and how perfectly it succeeds for that was the thing she had most immediately to acknowledge it seemed as easy for them to make a quartette as it had formerly so long appeared for them to make a pair of couples this latter being thus a discovery too absurdly belated the only point at which day after day the success appeared at all qualified was represented as might have been said by her irresistible impulse to give her father a clutch when the train indulged in one of its occasional lurches then there was no denying it his eyes and her own met so that they were themselves doing active violence as against the others to that very spirit of union or at least to that very achievement of change which she had taken the field to invoke the maximum of change was reached no doubt the day the matcham party dined in portland place the day really perhaps of maggie s maximum of social glory in the sense of its showing for her own occasion her very own with every one else extravagantly rallying and falling in absolutely conspiring to make her its heroine it was as if her father himself always with more initiative as a guest than as a host had dabbled too in the conspiracy and the impression was not diminished by the presence of the assinghams likewise very much caught up now after something of a lull by the side wind of all the rest of the motion and giving our young woman so far at least as fanny was concerned the sense of some special intention of encouragement and applause fanny who had not been present at the other dinner thanks to a preference entertained and expressed by charlotte made a splendid show at this one in new orange coloured velvet with multiplied turquoises and with a confidence furthermore as different as possible her hostess inferred from her too marked betrayal of a belittled state at matcham maggie was not indifferent to her own opportunity to redress this balance which seemed for the hour part of a general rectification she liked making out for herself that on the high level of portland place a spot exempt on all sorts of grounds from jealous jurisdictions her friend could feel as good as any one and could in fact at moments almost appear to take the lead in recognition and celebration so far as the evening might conduce to intensify the lustre of the little princess mrs assingham produced on her the impression of giving her constantly her cue for this and it was in truth partly by her help intelligently quite gratefully accepted that the little princess in maggie was drawn out and emphasised she couldn t definitely have said how it happened but she felt herself for the first time in her career living up to the public and popular notion of such a personage as it pressed upon her from all round rather wondering inwardly too while she did so at that strange mixture in things through which the popular notion could be evidenced for her by such supposedly great ones of the earth as the castledeans and their kind fanny assingham might really have been there at all events like one of the assistants in the ring at the circus to keep up the pace of the sleek revolving animal on whose back the lady in short spangled skirts should brilliantly caper and posture that was all doubtless maggie had forgotten had neglected had declined to be the little princess on anything like the scale open to her but now that the collective hand had been held out to her with such alacrity so that she might skip up into the light even as seemed to her modest mind with such a show of pink stocking and such an abbreviation of white petticoat she could strike herself as perceiving under arched eyebrows where her mistake had been she had invited for the later hours after her dinner a fresh contingent the whole list of her apparent london acquaintance which was again a thing in the manner of little princesses for whom the princely art was a matter of course that was what she was learning to do to fill out as a matter of course her appointed her expected her imposed character and though there were latent considerations that somewhat interfered with the lesson she was having to night an inordinate quantity of practice none of it so successful as when quite wittingly she directed it at lady castledean who was reduced by it at last to an unprecedented state of passivity the perception of this high result caused mrs assingham fairly to flush with responsive joy she glittered at her young friend from moment to moment quite feverishly it was positively as if her young friend had in some marvellous sudden supersubtle way become a source of succour to herself become beautifully divinely retributive the intensity of the taste of these registered phenomena was in fact that somehow by a process and through a connexion not again to be traced she so practised at the same time on amerigo and charlotte with only the drawback her constant check and second thought that she concomitantly practised perhaps still more on her father this last was a danger indeed that for much of the ensuing time had its hours of strange beguilement those at which her sense for precautions so suffered itself to lapse that she felt her communion with him more intimate than any other it couldn t but pass between them that something singular was happening so much as this she again and again said to herself whereby the comfort of it was there after all to be noted just as much as the possible peril and she could think of the couple they formed together as groping with sealed lips but with mutual looks that had never been so tender for some freedom some fiction some figured bravery under which they might safely talk of it the moment was to come and it finally came with an effect as penetrating as the sound that follows the pressure of an electric button when she read the least helpful of meanings into the agitation she had created the merely specious description of their case would have been that after being for a long time as a family delightfully uninterruptedly happy they had still had a new felicity to discover a felicity for which blessedly her father s appetite and her own in particular had been kept fresh and grateful this livelier march of their intercourse as a whole was the thing that occasionally determined in him the clutching instinct we have glanced at very much as if he had said to her in default of her breaking silence first everything is remarkably pleasant isn t it but where for it after all are we up in a balloon and whirling through space or down in the depths of the earth in the glimmering passages of a gold mine the equilibrium the precious condition lasted in spite of rearrangement there had been a fresh distribution of the different weights but the balance persisted and triumphed all of which was just the reason why she was forbidden face to face with the companion of her adventure the experiment of a test if they balanced they balanced she had to take that it deprived her of every pretext for arriving by however covert a process at what he thought but she had her hours thus of feeling supremely linked to him by the rigour of their law and when it came over her that all the while the wish on his side to spare her might be what most worked with him this very fact of their seeming to have nothing inward really to talk about wrapped him up for her in a kind of sweetness that was wanting as a consecration even in her yearning for her husband she was powerless however was only more utterly hushed when the interrupting flash came when she would have been all ready to say to him yes this is by every appearance the best time we ve had yet but don t you see all the same how they must be working together for it and how my very success my success in shifting our beautiful harmony to a new basis comes round to being their success above all their cleverness their amiability their power to hold out their complete possession in short of our life for how could she say as much as that without saying a great deal more without saying they ll do everything in the world that suits us save only one thing prescribe a line for us that will make them separate how could she so much as imagine herself even faintly murmuring that without putting into his mouth the very words that would have made her quail separate my dear do you want them to separate then you want us to you and me for how can the one separation take place without the other that was the question that in spirit she had heard him ask with its dread train moreover of involved and connected inquiries their own separation his and hers was of course perfectly thinkable but only on the basis of the sharpest of reasons well the sharpest the very sharpest would be that they could no longer afford as it were he to let his wife she to let her husband run them in such compact formation and say they accepted this account of their situation as a practical finality acting upon it and proceeding to a division would no sombre ghosts of the smothered past on either side show across the widening strait pale unappeased faces or raise in the very passage deprecating denouncing hands meanwhile however such things might be she was to have occasion to say to herself that there might be but a deeper treachery in recoveries and reassurances she was to feel alone again as she had felt at the issue of her high tension with her husband during their return from meeting the castledeans in eaton square the evening in question had left her with a larger alarm but then a lull had come the alarm after all was yet to be confirmed there came an hour inevitably when she knew with a chill what she had feared and why it had taken this hour a month to arrive but to find it before her was thoroughly to recognise it for it showed her sharply what amerigo had meant in alluding to a particular use that they might make for their reaffirmed harmony and prosperity of charlotte the more she thought at present of the tone he had employed to express their enjoyment of this resource the more it came back to her as the product of a conscious art of dealing with her he had been conscious at the moment of many things conscious even not a little of desiring and thereby of needing to see what she would do in a given case the given case would be that of her being to a certain extent as she might fairly make it out menaced horrible as it was to impute to him any intention represented by such a word why it was that to speak of making her stepmother intervene as they might call it in a question that seemed just then and there quite peculiarly their own business why it was that a turn so familiar and so easy should at the worst strike her as charged with the spirit of a threat was an oddity disconnected for her temporarily from its grounds the adventure of an imagination within her that possibly had lost its way that precisely was doubtless why she had learned to wait as the weeks passed by with a fair or rather indeed with an excessive imitation of resumed serenity there had been no prompt sequel to the prince s equivocal light and that made for patience yet she was none the less to have to admit after delay that the bread he had cast on the waters had come home and that she should thus be justified of her old apprehension the consequence of this in turn was a renewed pang in presence of his remembered ingenuity to be ingenious with her what didn t what mightn t that mean when she had so absolutely never at any point of contact with him put him by as much as the value of a penny to the expense of sparing doubting fearing her of having in any way whatever to reckon with her the ingenuity had been in his simply speaking of their use of charlotte as if it were common to them in an equal degree and his triumph on the occasion had been just in the simplicity she couldn t and he knew it say what was true oh you use her and i use her if you will yes but we use her ever so differently and separately not at all in the same way or degree there s nobody we really use together but ourselves don t you see by which i mean that where our interests are the same i can so beautifully so exquisitely serve you for everything and you can so beautifully so exquisitely serve me the only person either of us needs is the other of us so why as a matter of course in such a case as this drag in charlotte she couldn t so challenge him because it would have been and there she was paralysed the note it would have translated itself on the spot for his ear into jealousy and from reverberation to repercussion would have reached her father s exactly in the form of a cry piercing the stillness of peaceful sleep it had been for many days almost as difficult for her to catch a quiet twenty minutes with her father as it had formerly been easy there had been in fact of old the time so strangely seemed already far away an inevitability in her longer passages with him a sort of domesticated beauty in the calculability round about them of everything but at present charlotte was almost always there when amerigo brought her to eaton square where amerigo was constantly bringing her and amerigo was almost always there when charlotte brought her husband to portland place where charlotte was constantly bringing him the fractions of occasions the chance minutes that put them face to face had as yet of late contrived to count but little between them either for the sense of opportunity or for that of exposure inasmuch as the lifelong rhythm of their intercourse made against all cursory handling of deep things they had never availed themselves of any given quarter of an hour to gossip about fundamentals they moved slowly through large still spaces they could be silent together at any time beautifully with much more comfort than hurriedly expressive it appeared indeed to have become true that their common appeal measured itself for vividness just by this economy of sound they might have been talking at each other when they talked with their companions but these latter assuredly were not in any directer way to gain light on the current phase of their relation such were some of the reasons for which maggie suspected fundamentals as i have called them to be rising by a new movement to the surface suspected it one morning late in may when her father presented himself in portland place alone he had his pretext of that she was fully aware the principino two days before had shown signs happily not persistent of a feverish cold and had notoriously been obliged to spend the interval at home this was ground ample ground for punctual inquiry but what it wasn t ground for she quickly found herself reflecting was his having managed in the interest of his visit to dispense so unwontedly as their life had recently come to be arranged with his wife s attendance it had so happened that she herself was for the hour exempt from her husband s and it will at once be seen that the hour had a quality all its own when i note that remembering how the prince had looked in to say he was going out the princess whimsically wondered if their respective sposi mightn t frankly be meeting whimsically hoped indeed they were temporarily so disposed of strange was her need at moments to think of them as not attaching an excessive importance to their repudiation of the general practice that had rested only a few weeks before on such a consecrated rightness repudiations surely were not in the air they had none of them come to that for wasn t she at this minute testifying directly against them by her own behaviour when she should confess to fear of being alone with her father to fear of what he might then ah with such a slow painful motion as she had a horror of say to her then would be time enough for amerigo and charlotte to confess to not liking to appear to foregather she had this morning a wonderful consciousness both of dreading a particular question from him and of being able to check yes even to disconcert magnificently by her apparent manner of receiving it any restless imagination he might have about its importance the day bright and soft had the breath of summer it made them talk to begin with of fawns of the way fawns invited maggie aware the while that in thus regarding with him the sweetness of its invitation to one couple just as much as to another her humbugging smile grew very nearly convulsive that was it and there was relief truly of a sort in taking it in she was humbugging him already by absolute necessity as she had never never done in her life doing it up to the full height of what she had allowed for the necessity in the great dimly shining room where declining for his reasons to sit down he moved about in amerigo s very footsteps the necessity affected her as pressing upon her with the very force of the charm itself of the old pleasantness between them so candidly playing up there again of the positive flatness of their tenderness a surface all for familiar use quite as if generalised from the long succession of tapestried sofas sweetly faded on which his theory of contentment had sat through unmeasured pauses beside her own she knew from this instant knew in advance and as well as anything would ever teach her that she must never intermit for a solitary second her so highly undertaking to prove that there was nothing the matter with her she saw of a sudden everything she might say or do in the light of that undertaking established connections from it with any number of remote matters struck herself for instance as acting all in its interest when she proposed their going out in the exercise of their freedom and in homage to the season for a turn in the regent s park this resort was close at hand at the top of portland place and the principino beautifully better had already proceeded there under high attendance all of which considerations were defensive for maggie all of which became to her mind part of the business of cultivating continuity upstairs while she left him to put on something to go out in the thought of his waiting below for her in possession of the empty house brought with it sharply if briefly one of her abrupt arrests of consistency the brush of a vain imagination almost paralysing her often for the minute before her glass the vivid look in other words of the particular difference his marriage had made the particular difference seemed at such instants the loss more than anything else of their old freedom their never having had to think where they were together concerned of any one of anything but each other it hadn t been her marriage that did it that had never for three seconds suggested to either of them that they must act diplomatically must reckon with another presence no not even with her husband s she groaned to herself while the vain imagination lasted why did he marry ah why did he and then it came up to her more than ever that nothing could have been more beautiful than the way in which till charlotte came so much more closely into their life amerigo hadn t interfered what she had gone on owing him for this mounted up again to her eyes like a column of figures or call it even if one would a house of cards it was her father s wonderful act that had tipped the house down and made the sum wrong with all of which immediately after her question her why did he why did he rushed back inevitably the confounding the overwhelming wave of the knowledge of his reason he did it for me he did it for me she moaned he did it exactly that our freedom meaning beloved man simply and solely mine should be greater instead of less he did it divinely to liberate me so far as possible from caring what became of him she found time upstairs even in her haste as she had repeatedly found time before to let the wonderments involved in these recognitions flash at her with their customary effect of making her blink the question in especial of whether she might find her solution in acting herself in the spirit of what he had done in forcing her care really to grow as much less as he had tried to make it thus she felt the whole weight of their case drop afresh upon her shoulders was confronted unmistakably with the prime source of her haunted state it all came from her not having been able not to mind not to mind what became of him not having been able without anxiety to let him go his way and take his risk and lead his life she had made anxiety her stupid little idol and absolutely now while she stuck a long pin a trifle fallaciously into her hat she had with an approach to irritation told her maid a new woman whom she had lately found herself thinking of as abysmal that she didn t want her she tried to focus the possibility of some understanding between them in consequence of which he should cut loose very near indeed it looked any such possibility that consciousness too had taken its turn by the time she was ready all the vibration all the emotion of this present passage being precisely in the very sweetness of their lapse back into the conditions of the simpler time into a queer resemblance between the aspect and the feeling of the moment and those of numberless other moments that were sufficiently far away she had been quick in her preparation in spite of the flow of the tide that sometimes took away her breath but a pause once more was still left for her to make a pause at the top of the stairs before she came down to him in the span of which she asked herself if it weren t thinkable from the perfectly practical point of view that she should simply sacrifice him she didn t go into the detail of what sacrificing him would mean she didn t need to so distinct was it in one of her restless lights that there he was awaiting her that she should find him walking up and down the drawing room in the warm fragrant air to which the open windows and the abundant flowers contributed slowly and vaguely moving there and looking very slight and young and superficially manageable almost as much like her child putting it a little freely as like her parent with the appearance about him above all of having perhaps arrived just on purpose to say it to her himself in so many words sacrifice me my own love do sacrifice me do sacrifice me should she want to should she insist on it she might verily hear him bleating it at her all conscious and all accommodating like some precious spotless exceptionally intelligent lamb the positive effect of the intensity of this figure however was to make her shake it away in her resumed descent and after she had rejoined him after she had picked him up she was to know the full pang of the thought that her impossibility was made absolutely by his consciousness by the lucidity of his intention this she felt while she smiled there for him again all hypocritically while she drew on fair fresh gloves while she interrupted the process first to give his necktie a slightly smarter twist and then to make up to him for her hidden madness by rubbing her nose into his cheek according to the tradition of their frankest levity from the instant she should be able to convict him of intending every issue would be closed and her hypocrisy would have to redouble the only way to sacrifice him would be to do so without his dreaming what it might be for she kissed him she arranged his cravat she dropped remarks she guided him out she held his arm not to be led but to lead him and taking it to her by much the same intimate pressure she had always used when a little girl to mark the inseparability of her doll she did all these things so that he should sufficiently fail to dream of what they might be for xxix there was nothing to show that her effort in any degree fell short till they got well into the park and he struck her as giving unexpectedly the go by to any serious search for the principino the way they sat down awhile in the sun was a sign of that his dropping with her into the first pair of sequestered chairs they came across and waiting a little after they were placed as if now at last she might bring out as between them something more specific it made her but feel the more sharply how the specific in almost any direction was utterly forbidden her how the use of it would be for all the world like undoing the leash of a dog eager to follow up a scent it would come out the specific where the dog would come out would run to earth somehow the truth for she was believing herself in relation to the truth at which she mustn t so much as indirectly point such at any rate was the fashion in which her passionate prudence played over possibilities of danger reading symptoms and betrayals into everything she looked at and yet having to make it evident while she recognised them that she didn t wince there were moments between them in their chairs when he might have been watching her guard herself and trying to think of something new that would trip her up there were pauses during which with her affection as sweet and still as the sunshine she might yet as at some hard game over a table for money have been defying him to fasten upon her the least little complication of consciousness she was positively proud afterwards of the great style in which she had kept this up later on at the hour s end when they had retraced their steps to find amerigo and charlotte awaiting them at the house she was able to say to herself that truly she had put her plan through even though once more setting herself the difficult task of making their relation every minute of the time not fall below the standard of that other hour in the treasured past which hung there behind them like a framed picture in a museum a high watermark for the history of their old fortune the summer evening in the park at fawns when side by side under the trees just as now they had let their happy confidence lull them with its most golden tone there had been the possibility of a trap for her at present in the very question of their taking up anew that residence wherefore she had not been the first to sound it in spite of the impression from him of his holding off to see what she would do she was saying to herself in secret can we again in this form migrate there can i for myself undertake it face all the intenser keeping up and stretching out indefinitely impossibly that our conditions in the country as we ve established and accepted them would stand for she had positively lost herself in this inward doubt so much she was subsequently to remember but remembering then too that her companion though perceptibly perhaps as if not to be eager had broken the ice very much as he had broken it in eaton square after the banquet to the castledeans her mind had taken a long excursion wandered far into the vision of what a summer at fawns with amerigo and charlotte still more eminently in presence against that higher sky would bring forth wasn t her father meanwhile only pretending to talk of it just as she was in a manner pretending to listen he got off it finally at all events for the transition it couldn t well help thrusting out at him it had amounted exactly to an arrest of her private excursion by the sense that he had begun to imitate oh as never yet the ancient tone of gold it had verily come from him at last the question of whether she thought it would be very good but very good indeed that he should leave england for a series of weeks on some pretext with the prince then it had been that she was to know her husband s menace hadn t really dropped since she was face to face with the effect of it ah the effect of it had occupied all the rest of their walk had stayed out with them and come home with them besides making it impossible that they shouldn t presently feign to recollect how rejoining the child had been their original purpose maggie s uneffaced note was that it had at the end of five minutes more driven them to that endeavour as to a refuge and caused them afterwards to rejoice as well that the boy s irrepressibly importunate company in due course secured and enjoyed with the extension imparted by his governess a person expectant of consideration constituted a cover for any awkwardness for that was what it had all come to that the dear man had spoken to her to try her quite as he had been spoken to himself by charlotte with the same fine idea the princess took it in on the spot firmly grasping it she heard them together her father and his wife dealing with the queer case the prince tells me that maggie has a plan for your taking some foreign journey with him and as he likes to do everything she wants he has suggested my speaking to you for it as the thing most likely to make you consent so i do speak see being always so eager myself as you know to meet maggie s wishes i speak but without quite understanding this time what she has in her head why should she of a sudden at this particular moment desire to ship you off together and to remain here alone with me the compliment s all to me i admit and you must decide quite as you like the prince is quite ready evidently to do his part but you ll have it out with him that is you ll have it out with her something of that kind was what in her mind s ear maggie heard and this after his waiting for her to appeal to him directly was her father s invitation to her to have it out well as she could say to herself all the rest of the day that was what they did while they continued to sit there in their penny chairs that was what they had done as much as they would now ever ever have out anything the measure of this at least had been given that each would fight to the last for the protection for the perversion of any real anxiety she had confessed instantly with her humbugging grin not flinching by a hair meeting his eyes as mildly as he met hers she had confessed to her fancy that they might both he and his son in law have welcomed such an escapade since they had both been so long so furiously domestic she had almost cocked her hat under the inspiration of this opportunity to hint how a couple of spirited young men reacting from confinement and sallying forth arm in arm might encounter the agreeable in forms that would strike them for the time at least as novel she had felt for fifty seconds with her eyes all so sweetly and falsely in her companion s horribly vulgar yet without minding it either such luck should she have if to be nothing worse than vulgar would see her through and i thought amerigo might like it better she had said than wandering off alone do you mean that he won t go unless i take him she had considered here and never in her life had she considered so promptly and so intently if she really put it that way her husband challenged might belie the statement so that what would that do but make her father wonder make him perhaps ask straight out why she was exerting pressure she couldn t of course afford to be suspected for an instant of exerting pressure which was why she was obliged only to make answer wouldn t that be just what you must have out with him decidedly if he makes me the proposal but he hasn t made it yet oh once more how she was to feel she had smirked perhaps he s too shy because you re so sure he so really wants my company i think he has thought you might like it well i should but with this he looked away from her and she held her breath to hear him either ask if she wished him to address the question to amerigo straight or inquire if she should be greatly disappointed by his letting it drop what had settled her as she was privately to call it was that he had done neither of these things and had thereby markedly stood off from the risk involved in trying to draw out her reason to attenuate on the other hand this appearance and quite as if to fill out the too large receptacle made so musingly by his abstention he had himself presently given her a reason had positively spared her the effort of asking whether he judged charlotte not to have approved he had taken everything on himself that was what had settled her she had had to wait very little more to feel with this how much he was taking the point he made was his lack of any eagerness to put time and space on any such scale between himself and his wife he wasn t so unhappy with her far from it and maggie was to hold that he had grinned back paternally through his rather shielding glasses in easy emphasis of this as to be able to hint that he required the relief of absence therefore unless it was for the prince himself oh i don t think it would have been for amerigo himself amerigo and i maggie had said perfectly rub on together well then there we are i see and she had again with sublime blandness assented there we are charlotte and i too her father had gaily proceeded perfectly rub on together and then he had appeared for a little to be making time to put it only so he had mildly and happily added to put it only so he had spoken as if he might easily put it much better yet as if the humour of contented understatement fairly sufficed for the occasion he had played then either all consciously or all unconsciously into charlotte s hands and the effect of this was to render trebly oppressive maggie s conviction of charlotte s plan she had done what she wanted his wife had which was also what amerigo had made her do she had kept her test maggie s test from becoming possible and had applied instead a test of her own it was exactly as if she had known that her stepdaughter would be afraid to be summoned to say under the least approach to cross examination why any change was desirable and it was for our young woman herself still more prodigiously as if her father had been capable of calculations to match of judging it important he shouldn t be brought to demand of her what was the matter with her why otherwise with such an opportunity hadn t he demanded it always from calculation that was why that was why he was terrified of the retort he might have invoked what my dear if you come to that is the matter with you when a minute later on he had followed up his last note by a touch or two designed still further to conjure away the ghost of the anomalous at that climax verily she would have had to be dumb to the question there seems a kind of charm doesn t there on our life and quite as if just lately it had got itself somehow renewed had waked up refreshed a kind of wicked selfish prosperity perhaps as if we had grabbed everything fixed everything down to the last lovely object for the last glass case of the last corner left over of my old show that s the only take off that it has made us perhaps lazy a wee bit languid lying like gods together all careless of mankind do you consider that we re languid that form of rejoinder she had jumped at for the sake of its pretty lightness do you consider that we are careless of mankind living as we do in the biggest crowd in the world and running about always pursued and pursuing it had made him think indeed a little longer than she had meant but he came up again as she might have said smiling well i don t know we get nothing but the fun do we no she had hastened to declare we certainly get nothing but the fun we do it all he had remarked so beautifully we do it all so beautifully she hadn t denied this for a moment i see what you mean well i mean too he had gone on that we haven t no doubt enough the sense of difficulty enough enough for what enough not to be selfish i don t think you are selfish she had returned and had managed not to wail it i don t say that it s me particularly or that it s you or charlotte or amerigo but we re selfish together we move as a selfish mass you see we want always the same thing he had gone on and that holds us that binds us together we want each other he had further explained only wanting it each time for each other that s what i call the happy spell but it s also a little possibly the immorality the immorality she had pleasantly echoed well we re tremendously moral for ourselves that is for each other and i won t pretend that i know exactly at whose particular personal expense you and i for instance are happy what it comes to i daresay is that there s something haunting as if it were a bit uncanny in such a consciousness of our general comfort and privilege unless indeed he had rambled on it s only i to whom fantastically it says so much that s all i mean at any rate that it s sort of soothing as if we were sitting about on divans with pigtails smoking opium and seeing visions let us then be up and doing what is it longfellow says that seems sometimes to ring out like the police breaking in into our opium den to give us a shake but the beauty of it is at the same time that we are doing we re doing that is after all what we went in for we re working it our life our chance whatever you may call it as we saw it as we felt it from the first we have worked it and what more can you do than that it s a good deal for me he had wound up to have made charlotte so happy to have so perfectly contented her you from a good way back were a matter of course i mean your being all right so that i needn t mind your knowing that my great interest since then has rather inevitably been in making sure of the same success very much to your advantage as well for charlotte if we ve worked our life our idea really as i say if at any rate i can sit here and say that i ve worked my share of it it has not been what you may call least by our having put charlotte so at her ease that has been soothing all round that has curled up as the biggest of the blue fumes or whatever they are of the opium don t you see what a cropper we would have come if she hadn t settled down as she has and he had concluded by turning to maggie as for something she mightn t really have thought of you darling in that case i verily believe would have been the one to hate it most to hate it maggie had wondered to hate our having with our tremendous intentions not brought it off and i daresay i should have hated it for you even more than for myself that s not unlikely perhaps when it was for me after all that you did it he had hesitated but only a moment i never told you so well charlotte herself soon enough told me but i never told her her father had answered are you very sure she had presently asked well i like to think how thoroughly i was taken with her and how right i was and how fortunate to have that for my basis i told her all the good i thought of her then that maggie had returned was precisely part of the good i mean it was precisely part of it that she could so beautifully understand yes understand everything everything and in particular your reasons her telling me that showed me how she had understood they were face to face again now and she saw she had made his colour rise it was as if he were still finding in her eyes the concrete image the enacted scene of her passage with charlotte which he was now hearing of for the first time and as to which it would have been natural he should question her further his forbearance to do so would but mark precisely the complication of his fears what she does like he finally said is the way it has succeeded your marriage yes my whole idea the way i ve been justified that s the joy i give her if for her either it had failed that however was not worth talking about he had broken off you think then you could now risk fawns risk it well morally from the point of view i was talking of that of our sinking deeper into sloth our selfishness somehow seems at its biggest down there maggie had allowed him the amusement of her not taking this up is charlotte she had simply asked really ready oh if you and i and amerigo are whenever one corners charlotte he had developed more at his ease one finds that she only wants to know what we want which is what we got her for what we got her for exactly and so for a little even though with a certain effect of oddity in their more or less successful ease they left it left it till maggie made the remark that it was all the same wonderful her stepmother should be willing before the season was out to exchange so much company for so much comparative solitude ah he had then made answer that s because her idea i think this time is that we shall have more people more than we ve hitherto had in the country don t you remember that that originally was what we were to get her for oh yes to give us a life maggie had gone through the form of recalling this and the light of their ancient candour shining from so far back had seemed to bring out some things so strangely that with the sharpness of the vision she had risen to her feet well with a life fawns will certainly do he had remained in his place while she looked over his head the picture in her vision had suddenly swarmed the vibration was that of one of the lurches of the mystic train in which with her companion she was travelling but she was having to steady herself this time before meeting his eyes she had measured indeed the full difference between the move to fawns because each of them now knew the others wanted it and the pairing off for a journey of her husband and her father which nobody knew that either wanted more company at fawns would be effectually enough the key in which her husband and her stepmother were at work there was truly no question but that she and her father must accept any array of visitors no one could try to marry him now what he had just said was a direct plea for that and what was the plea itself but an act of submission to charlotte he had from his chair been noting her look but he had the next minute also risen and then it was they had reminded each other of their having come out for the boy their junction with him and with his companion successfully effected the four had moved home more slowly and still more vaguely yet with a vagueness that permitted of maggie s reverting an instant to the larger issue if we have people in the country then as you were saying do you know for whom my first fancy would be you may be amused but it would be for the castledeans i see but why should i be amused well i mean i am myself i don t think i like her and yet i like to see her which as amerigo says is rum but don t you feel she s very handsome her father inquired yes but it isn t for that then what is it for simply that she may be there just there before us it s as if she may have a value as if something may come of her i don t in the least know what and she rather irritates me meanwhile i don t even know i admit why but if we see her often enough i may find out does it matter so very much her companion had asked while they moved together she had hesitated you mean because you do rather like her he on his side too had waited a little but then he had taken it from her yes i guess i do rather like her which she accepted for the first case she could recall of their not being affected by a person in the same way it came back therefore to his pretending but she had gone far enough and to add to her appearance of levity she further observed that though they were so far from a novelty she should also immediately desire at fawns the presence of the assinghams that put everything on a basis independent of explanations yet it was extraordinary at the same time how much once in the country again with the others she was going as they used to say at home to need the presence of the good fanny it was the strangest thing in the world but it was as if mrs assingham might in a manner mitigate the intensity of her consciousness of charlotte it was as if the two would balance one against the other as if it came round again in that fashion to her idea of the equilibrium it would be like putting this friend into her scale to make weight into the scale with her father and herself amerigo and charlotte would be in the other therefore it would take the three of them to keep that one straight and as this played all duskily in her mind it had received from her father with a sound of suddenness a luminous contribution ah rather do let s have the assinghams it would be to have them she had said as we used so much to have them for a good long stay in the old way and on the old terms as regular boarders fanny used to call it that is if they ll come as regular boarders on the old terms that s what i should like too but i guess they ll come her companion had added in a tone into which she had read meanings the main meaning was that he felt he was going to require them quite as much as she was his recognition of the new terms as different from the old what was that practically but a confession that something had happened and a perception that interested in the situation she had helped to create mrs assingham would be by so much as this concerned in its inevitable development it amounted to an intimation off his guard that he should be thankful for some one to turn to if she had wished covertly to sound him he had now in short quite given himself away and if she had even at the start needed anything more to settle her here assuredly was enough he had hold of his small grandchild as they retraced their steps swinging the boy s hand and not bored as he never was by his always bristling like a fat little porcupine with shrill interrogation points so that secretly while they went she had wondered again if the equilibrium mightn t have been more real mightn t above all have demanded less strange a study had it only been on the books that charlotte should give him a principino of his own she had repossessed herself now of his other arm only this time she was drawing him back gently helplessly back to what they had tried for the hour to get away from just as he was consciously drawing the child and as high miss bogle on her left representing the duties of home was complacently drawing her the duties of home when the house in portland place reappeared showed even from a distance as vividly there before them amerigo and charlotte had come in that is amerigo had charlotte rather having come out and the pair were perched together in the balcony he bare headed she divested of her jacket her mantle or whatever but crowned with a brilliant brave hat responsive to the balmy day which maggie immediately spotted as new as insuperably original as worn in characteristic generous harmony for the first time all evidently to watch for the return of the absent to be there to take them over again as punctually as possible they were gay they were amused in the pleasant morning they leaned across the rail and called down their greeting lighting up the front of the great black house with an expression that quite broke the monotony that might almost have shocked the decency of portland place the group on the pavement stared up as at the peopled battlements of a castle even miss bogle who carried her head most aloft gaped a little through the interval of space as toward truly superior beings there could scarce have been so much of the open mouth since the dingy waits on christmas eve had so lamentably chanted for pennies the time when amerigo insatiable for english customs had come out with a gasped santissima vergine to marvel at the depositaries of this tradition and purchase a reprieve maggie s individual gape was inevitably again for the thought of how the pair would be at work xxx she had not again for weeks had mrs assingham so effectually in presence as on the afternoon of that lady s return from the easter party at matcham but the intermission was made up as soon as the date of the migration to fawns that of the more or less simultaneous adjournment of the two houses began to be discussed it had struck her promptly that this renewal with an old friend of the old terms she had talked of with her father was the one opening for her spirit that wouldn t too much advertise or betray her even her father who had always as he would have said believed in their ancient ally wouldn t necessarily suspect her of invoking fanny s aid toward any special inquiry and least of all if fanny would only act as fanny so easily might maggie s measure of fanny s ease would have been agitating to mrs assingham had it been all at once revealed to her as for that matter it was soon destined to become even on a comparatively graduated showing our young woman s idea in particular was that her safety her escape from being herself suspected of suspicion would proceed from this friend s power to cover to protect and as might be even showily to represent her represent that is her relation to the form of the life they were all actually leading this would doubtless be as people said a large order but that mrs assingham existed substantially or could somehow be made prevailingly to exist for her private benefit was the finest flower maggie had plucked from among the suggestions sown like abundant seed on the occasion of the entertainment offered in portland place to the matcham company mrs assingham that night rebounding from dejection had bristled with bravery and sympathy she had then absolutely she had perhaps recklessly for herself betrayed the deeper and darker consciousness an impression it would now be late for her inconsistently to attempt to undo it was with a wonderful air of giving out all these truths that the princess at present approached her again making doubtless at first a sufficient scruple of letting her know what in especial she asked of her yet not a bit ashamed as she in fact quite expressly declared of fanny s discerned foreboding of the strange uses she might perhaps have for her quite from the first really maggie said extraordinary things to her such as you can help me you know my dear when nobody else can such as i almost wish upon my word that you had something the matter with you that you had lost your health or your money or your reputation forgive me love so that i might be with you as much as i want or keep you with me without exciting comment without exciting any other remark than that such kindnesses are like me we have each our own way of making up for our unselfishness and maggie who had no small self at all as against her husband or her father and only a weak and uncertain one as against her stepmother would verily at this crisis have seen mrs assingham s personal life or liberty sacrificed without a pang the attitude that the appetite in question maintained in her was to draw peculiar support moreover from the current aspects and agitations of her victim this personage struck her in truth as ready for almost anything as not perhaps effusively protesting yet as wanting with a restlessness of her own to know what she wanted and in the long run which was none so long either there was to be no difficulty as happened about that it was as if for all the world maggie had let her see that she held her that she made her fairly responsible for something not to begin with dotting all the i s nor hooking together all the links but treating her without insistence rather with caressing confidence as there to see and to know to advise and to assist the theory visibly had patched itself together for her that the dear woman had somehow from the early time had a hand in all their fortunes so that there was no turn of their common relations and affairs that couldn t be traced back in some degree to her original affectionate interest on this affectionate interest the good lady s young friend now built before her eyes very much as a wise or even as a mischievous child playing on the floor might pile up blocks skilfully and dizzily with an eye on the face of a covertly watching elder when the blocks tumbled down they but acted after the nature of blocks yet the hour would come for their rising so high that the structure would have to be noticed and admired mrs assingham s appearance of unreservedly giving herself involved meanwhile on her own side no separate recognitions her face of almost anxious attention was directed altogether to her young friend s so vivid felicity it suggested that she took for granted at the most certain vague recent enhancements of that state if the princess now more than before was going and going she was prompt to publish that she beheld her go that she had always known she would sooner or later and that any appeal for participation must more or less contain and invite the note of triumph there was a blankness in her blandness assuredly and very nearly an extravagance in her generalising gaiety a precipitation of cheer particularly marked whenever they met again after short separations meetings during the first flush of which maggie sometimes felt reminded of other looks in other faces of two strangely unobliterated impressions above all the physiognomic light that had played out in her husband at the shock she had come at last to talk to herself of the shock of his first vision of her on his return from matcham and gloucester and the wonder of charlotte s beautiful bold wavering gaze when the next morning in eaton square this old friend had turned from the window to begin to deal with her if she had dared to think of it so crudely she would have said that fanny was afraid of her afraid of something she might say or do even as for their few brief seconds amerigo and charlotte had been which made exactly an expressive element common to the three the difference however was that this look had in the dear woman its oddity of a constant renewal whereas it had never for the least little instant again peeped out of the others other looks other lights radiant and steady with the others had taken its place reaching a climax so short a time ago that morning of the appearance of the pair on the balcony of her house to overlook what she had been doing with her father when their general interested brightness and beauty attuned to the outbreak of summer had seemed to shed down warmth and welcome and the promise of protection they were conjoined not to do anything to startle her and now at last so completely that with experience and practice they had almost ceased to fear their liability mrs assingham on the other hand deprecating such an accident not less had yet less assurance as having less control the high pitch of her cheer accordingly the tentative adventurous expressions of the would be smiling order that preceded her approach even like a squad of skirmishers or whatever they were called moving ahead of the baggage train these things had at the end of a fortnight brought a dozen times to our young woman s lips a challenge that had the cunning to await its right occasion but of the relief of which as a demonstration she meanwhile felt no little need you ve such a dread of my possibly complaining to you that you keep pealing all the bells to drown my voice but don t cry out my dear till you re hurt and above all ask yourself how i can be so wicked as to complain what in the name of all that s fantastic can you dream that i have to complain of such inquiries the princess temporarily succeeded in repressing and she did so in a measure by the aid of her wondering if this ambiguity with which her friend affected her wouldn t be at present a good deal like the ambiguity with which she herself must frequently affect her father she wondered how she should enjoy on his part such a take up as she but just succeeded from day to day in sparing mrs assingham and that made for her trying to be as easy with this associate as mr verver blessed man all indulgent but all inscrutable was with his daughter she had extracted from her none the less a vow in respect to the time that if the colonel might be depended on they would spend at fawns and nothing came home to her more in this connection or inspired her with a more intimate interest than her sense of absolutely seeing her interlocutress forbear to observe that charlotte s view of a long visit even from such allies was there to be reckoned with fanny stood off from that proposition as visibly to the princess and as consciously to herself as she might have backed away from the edge of a chasm into which she feared to slip a truth that contributed again to keep before our young woman her own constant danger of advertising her subtle processes that charlotte should have begun to be restrictive about the assinghams which she had never and for a hundred obviously good reasons been before this in itself was a fact of the highest value for maggie and of a value enhanced by the silence in which fanny herself so much too unmistakably dressed it what gave it quite thrillingly its price was exactly the circumstance that it thus opposed her to her stepmother more actively if she was to back up her friends for holding out than she had ever yet been opposed though of course with the involved result of the fine chance given mrs verver to ask her husband for explanations ah from the moment she should be definitely caught in opposition there would be naturally no saying how much charlotte s opportunities might multiply what would become of her father she hauntedly asked if his wife on the one side should begin to press him to call his daughter to order and the force of old habit to put it only at that should dispose him not less effectively to believe in this young person at any price there she was all round imprisoned in the circle of the reasons it was impossible she should give certainly give him the house in the country was his house and thereby was charlotte s it was her own and amerigo s only so far as its proper master and mistress should profusely place it at their disposal maggie felt of course that she saw no limit to her father s profusion but this couldn t be even at the best the case with charlotte s whom it would never be decent when all was said to reduce to fighting for her preferences there were hours truly when the princess saw herself as not unarmed for battle if battle might only take place without spectators this last advantage for her was however too sadly out of the question her sole strength lay in her being able to see that if charlotte wouldn t want the assinghams it would be because that sentiment too would have motives and grounds she had all the while command of one way of meeting any objection any complaint on his wife s part reported to her by her father it would be open to her to retort to his possible what are your reasons my dear by a lucidly produced what are hers love please isn t that what we had better know mayn t her reasons be a dislike beautifully founded of the presence and thereby of the observation of persons who perhaps know about her things it s inconvenient to her they should know that hideous card she might in mere logic play being by this time at her still swifter private pace intimately familiar with all the fingered pasteboard in her pack but she could play it only on the forbidden issue of sacrificing him the issue so forbidden that it involved even a horror of finding out if he would really have consented to be sacrificed what she must do she must do by keeping her hands off him and nothing meanwhile as we see had less in common with that scruple than such a merciless manipulation of their yielding beneficiaries as her spirit so boldly revelled in she saw herself in this connexion without detachment saw others alone with intensity otherwise she might have been struck fairly have been amused by her free assignment of the pachydermatous quality if she could face the awkwardness of the persistence of her friends at fawns in spite of charlotte she somehow looked to them for an inspiration of courage that would improve upon her own they were in short not only themselves to find a plausibility and an audacity but were somehow by the way to pick up these forms for her maggie as well and she felt indeed that she was giving them scant time longer when one afternoon in portland place she broke out with an irrelevance that was merely superficial what awfulness in heaven s name is there between them what do you believe what do you know oh if she went by faces her visitor s sudden whiteness at this might have carried her far fanny assingham turned pale for it but there was something in such an appearance in the look it put into the eyes that renewed maggie s conviction of what this companion had been expecting she had been watching it come come from afar and now that it was there after all and the first convulsion over they would doubtless soon find themselves in a more real relation it was there because of the sunday luncheon they had partaken of alone together it was there as strangely as one would because of the bad weather the cold perverse june rain that was making the day wrong it was there because it stood for the whole sum of the perplexities and duplicities among which our young woman felt herself lately to have picked her steps it was there because amerigo and charlotte were again paying together alone a week end visit which it had been maggie s plan infernally to promote just to see if this time they really would it was there because she had kept fanny on her side from paying one she would manifestly have been glad to pay and had made her come instead stupidly vacantly boringly to luncheon all in the spirit of celebrating the fact that the prince and mrs verver had thus put it into her own power to describe them exactly as they were it had abruptly occurred in truth that maggie required the preliminary help of determining how they were though on the other hand before her guest had answered her question everything in the hour and the place everything in all the conditions affected her as crying it out her guest s stare of ignorance above all that of itself at first cried it out between them what do you mean anything there shouldn t be there shouldn t have been all this time do you believe there is or what s your idea fanny s idea was clearly to begin with that her young friend had taken her breath away but she looked at her very straight and very hard do you speak from a suspicion of your own i speak at last from a torment forgive me if it comes out i ve been thinking for months and months and i ve no one to turn to no one to help me to make things out no impression but my own don t you see to go by you ve been thinking for months and months mrs assingham took it in but what then dear maggie have you been thinking well horrible things like a little beast that i perhaps am that there may be something something wrong and dreadful something they cover up the elder woman s colour had begun to come back she was able though with a visible effort to face the question less amazedly you imagine poor child that the wretches are in love is that it but maggie for a minute only stared back at her help me to find out what i imagine i don t know i ve nothing but my perpetual anxiety have you any do you see what i mean if you ll tell me truly that at least one way or the other will do something for me fanny s look had taken a peculiar gravity a fulness with which it seemed to shine is what it comes to that you re jealous of charlotte do you mean whether i hate her and maggie thought no not on account of father ah mrs assingham returned that isn t what one would suppose what i ask is if you re jealous on account of your husband well said maggie presently perhaps that may be all if i m unhappy i m jealous it must come to the same thing and with you at least i m not afraid of the word if i m jealous don t you see i m tormented she went on and all the more if i m helpless and if i m both helpless and tormented i stuff my pocket handkerchief into my mouth i keep it there for the most part night and day so as not to be heard too indecently moaning only now with you at last i can t keep it longer i ve pulled it out and here i am fairly screaming at you they re away she wound up so they can t hear and i m by a miracle of arrangement not at luncheon with father at home i live in the midst of miracles of arrangement half of which i admit are my own i go about on tiptoe i watch for every sound i feel every breath and yet i try all the while to seem as smooth as old satin dyed rose colour have you ever thought of me she asked as really feeling as i do her companion conspicuously required to be clear jealous unhappy tormented no said mrs assingham but at the same time and though you may laugh at me for it i m bound to confess that i ve never been so awfully sure of what i may call knowing you here you are indeed as you say such a deep little person i ve never imagined your existence poisoned and since you wish to know if i consider that it need be i ve not the least difficulty in speaking on the spot nothing decidedly strikes me as more unnecessary for a minute after this they remained face to face maggie had sprung up while her friend sat enthroned and after moving to and fro in her intensity now paused to receive the light she had invoked it had accumulated considerably by this time round mrs assingham s ample presence and it made even to our young woman s own sense a medium in which she could at last take a deeper breath i ve affected you these months and these last weeks in especial as quiet and natural and easy but it was a question that took not imperceptibly some answering you ve never affected me from the first hour i beheld you as anything but in a way all your own absolutely good and sweet and beautiful in a way as i say mrs assingham almost caressingly repeated just all your very own nobody else s at all i ve never thought of you but as outside of ugly things so ignorant of any falsity or cruelty or vulgarity as never to have to be touched by them or to touch them i ve never mixed you up with them there would have been time enough for that if they had seemed to be near you but they haven t if that s what you want to know you ve only believed me contented then because you ve believed me stupid mrs assingham had a free smile now for the length of this stride dissimulated though it might be in a graceful little frisk if i had believed you stupid i shouldn t have thought you interesting and if i hadn t thought you interesting i shouldn t have noted whether i knew you as i ve called it or not what i ve always been conscious of is your having concealed about you somewhere no small amount of character quite as much in fact fanny smiled as one could suppose a person of your size able to carry the only thing was she explained that thanks to your never calling one s attention to it i hadn t made out much more about it and should have been vague above all as to where you carried it or kept it somewhere under i should simply have said like that little silver cross you once showed me blest by the holy father that you always wear out of sight next your skin that relic i ve had a glimpse of with which she continued to invoke the privilege of humour but the precious little innermost say this time little golden personal nature of you blest by a greater power i think even than the pope that you ve never consentingly shown me i m not sure you ve ever consentingly shown it to anyone you ve been in general too modest maggie trying to follow almost achieved a little fold of her forehead i strike you as modest to day modest when i stand here and scream at you oh your screaming i ve granted you is something new i must fit it on somewhere the question is however mrs assingham further proceeded of what the deuce i can fit it on to do you mean she asked to the fact of our friends being from yesterday to to morrow at a place where they may more or less irresponsibly meet she spoke with the air of putting it as badly for them as possible are you thinking of their being there alone of their having consented to be and then as she had waited without result for her companion to say but isn t it true that after you had this time again at the eleventh hour said you wouldn t they would really much rather not have gone yes they would certainly much rather not have gone but i wanted them to go then my dear child what in the world is the matter i wanted to see if they would and they ve had to maggie added it was the only thing her friend appeared to wonder from the moment you and your father backed out oh i don t mean go for those people i mean go for us for father and me maggie went on because now they know they know fanny assingham quavered that i ve been for some time past taking more notice notice of the queer things in our life maggie saw her companion for an instant on the point of asking her what these queer things might be but mrs assingham had the next minute brushed by that ambiguous opening and taken as she evidently felt a better one and is it for that you did it i mean gave up the visit it s for that i did it to leave them to themselves as they less and less want or at any rate less and less venture to appear to want to be left as they had for so long arranged things the princess went on you see they sometimes have to be and then as if baffled by the lucidity of this mrs assingham for a little said nothing now do you think i m modest with time however fanny could brilliantly think anything that would serve i think you re wrong that my dear is my answer to your question it demands assuredly the straightest i can make i see no awfulness i suspect none i m deeply distressed she added that you should do anything else it drew again from maggie a long look you ve never even imagined anything ah god forbid for it s exactly as a woman of imagination that i speak there s no moment of my life at which i m not imagining something and it s thanks to that darling mrs assingham pursued that i figure the sincerity with which your husband whom you see as viciously occupied with your stepmother is interested is tenderly interested in his admirable adorable wife she paused a minute as to give her friend the full benefit of this as to maggie s measure of which however no sign came and then poor woman haplessly she crowned her effort he wouldn t hurt a hair of your head it had produced in maggie at once and apparently in the intended form of a smile the most extraordinary expression ah there it is but her guest had already gone on and i m absolutely certain that charlotte wouldn t either it kept the princess with her strange grimace standing there no charlotte wouldn t either that s how they ve had again to go off together they ve been afraid not to lest it should disturb me aggravate me somehow work upon me as i insisted that they must that we couldn t all fail though father and charlotte hadn t really accepted as i did this they had to yield to the fear that their showing as afraid to move together would count for them as the greater danger which would be the danger you see of my feeling myself wronged their least danger they know is in going on with all the things that i ve seemed to accept and that i ve given no indication at any moment of not accepting everything that has come up for them has come up in an extraordinary manner without my having by a sound or a sign given myself away so that it s all as wonderful as you may conceive they move at any rate among the dangers i speak of between that of their doing too much and that of their not having any longer the confidence or the nerve or whatever you may call it to do enough her tone by this time might have shown a strangeness to match her smile which was still more marked as she wound up and that s how i make them do what i like it had an effect on mrs assingham who rose with the deliberation that from point to point marked the widening of her grasp my dear child you re amazing amazing you re terrible maggie thoughtfully shook her head no i m not terrible and you don t think me so i do strike you as surprising no doubt but surprisingly mild because don t you see i am mild i can bear anything oh bear mrs assingham fluted for love said the princess fanny hesitated of your father for love maggie repeated it kept her friend watching of your husband for love maggie said again it was for the moment as if the distinctness of this might have determined in her companion a choice between two or three highly different alternatives mrs assingham s rejoinder at all events however much or however little it was a choice was presently a triumph speaking with this love of your own then have you undertaken to convey to me that you believe your husband and your father s wife to be in act and in fact lovers of each other and then as the princess didn t at first answer do you call such an allegation as that mild oh i m not pretending to be mild to you but i ve told you and moreover you must have seen for yourself how much so i ve been to them mrs assingham more brightly again bridled is that what you call it when you make them for terror as you say do as you like ah there wouldn t be any terror for them if they had nothing to hide mrs assingham faced her quite steady now are you really conscious love of what you re saying i m saying that i m bewildered and tormented and that i ve no one but you to speak to i ve thought i ve in fact been sure that you ve seen for yourself how much this is the case it s why i ve believed you would meet me half way half way to what to denouncing fanny asked two persons friends of years whom i ve always immensely admired and liked and against whom i haven t the shadow of a charge to make maggie looked at her with wide eyes i had much rather you should denounce me than denounce them denounce me denounce me she said if you can see your way it was exactly what she appeared to have argued out with herself if conscientiously you can denounce me if conscientiously you can revile me if conscientiously you can put me in my place for a low minded little pig well said mrs assingham consideringly as she paused for emphasis i think i shall be saved her friend took it for a minute however by carrying thoughtful eyes eyes verily portentous over her head you say you ve no one to speak to and you make a point of your having so disguised your feelings not having as you call it given yourself away have you then never seen it not only as your right but as your bounden duty worked up to such a pitch to speak to your husband i ve spoken to him said maggie mrs assingham stared ah then it isn t true that you ve made no sign maggie had a silence i ve made no trouble i ve made no scene i ve taken no stand i ve neither reproached nor accused him you ll say there s a way in all that of being nasty enough oh dropped from fanny as if she couldn t help it but i don t think strangely enough that he regards me as nasty i think that at bottom for that is said the princess the strangeness he s sorry for me yes i think that deep within he pities me her companion wondered for the state you ve let yourself get into for not being happy when i ve so much to make me so you ve everything said mrs assingham with alacrity yet she remained for an instant embarrassed as to a further advance i don t understand however how if you ve done nothing an impatience from maggie had checked her i ve not done absolutely nothing but what then well she went on after a minute he knows what i ve done it produced on mrs assingham s part her whole tone and manner exquisitely aiding a hush not less prolonged and the very duration of which inevitably gave it something of the character of an equal recognition and what then has he done maggie took again a minute he has been splendid splendid then what more do you want ah what you see said maggie not to be afraid it made her guest again hang fire not to be afraid really to speak not to be afraid not to speak mrs assingham considered further you can t even to charlotte but as at this after a look at her maggie turned off with a movement of suppressed despair she checked herself and might have been watching her for all the difficulty and the pity of it vaguely moving to the window and the view of the hill street it was almost as if she had had to give up from failure of responsive wit in her friend the last failure she had feared the hope of the particular relief she had been working for mrs assingham resumed the next instant however in the very tone that seemed most to promise her she should have to give up nothing i see i see you would have in that case too many things to consider it brought the princess round again proving itself thus the note of comprehension she wished most to clutch at don t be afraid maggie took it where she stood which she was soon able to signify thank you it very properly encouraged her counsellor what your idea imputes is a criminal intrigue carried on from day to day amid perfect trust and sympathy not only under your eyes but under your father s that s an idea it s impossible for me for a moment to entertain ah there you are then it s exactly what i wanted from you you re welcome to it mrs assingham breathed you never have entertained it maggie pursued never for an instant said fanny with her head very high maggie took it again yet again as wanting more pardon my being so horrid but by all you hold sacred mrs assingham faced her ah my dear upon my positive word as an honest woman thank you then said the princess so they remained a little after which but do you believe it love fanny inquired i believe you well as i ve faith in them it comes to the same thing maggie at this last appeared for a moment to think again but she embraced the proposition the same thing then you re no longer unhappy her guest urged coming more gaily toward her i doubtless shan t be a great while but it was now mrs assingham s turn to want more i ve convinced you it s impossible she had held out her arms and maggie after a moment meeting her threw herself into them with a sound that had its oddity as a sign of relief impossible impossible she emphatically more than emphatically replied yet the next minute she had burst into tears over the impossibility and a few seconds later pressing clinging sobbing had even caused them to flow audibly sympathetically and perversely from her friend xxxi the understanding appeared to have come to be that the colonel and his wife were to present themselves toward the middle of july for the good long visit at fawns on which maggie had obtained from her father that he should genially insist as well as that the couple from eaton square should welcome there earlier in the month and less than a week after their own arrival the advent of the couple from portland place oh we shall give you time to breathe fanny remarked in reference to the general prospect with a gaiety that announced itself as heedless of criticism to each member of the party in turn sustaining and bracing herself by her emphasis pushed even to an amiable cynicism of the confident view of these punctualities of the assinghams the ground she could best occupy to her sense was that of her being moved as in this connexion she had always been moved by the admitted grossness of her avidity the way the hospitality of the ververs met her convenience and ministered to her ease destitute as the colonel had kept her from the first of any rustic retreat any leafy bower of her own any fixed base for the stale season now at hand she had explained at home she had repeatedly reexplained the terms of her dilemma the real difficulty of her or as she now put it of their position when the pair could do nothing else in cadogan place they could still talk of marvellous little maggie and of the charm the sinister charm of their having to hold their breath to watch her a topic the momentous midnight discussion at which we have been present was so far from having exhausted it came up irrepressibly at all private hours they had planted it there between them and it grew from day to day in a manner to make their sense of responsibility almost yield to their sense of fascination mrs assingham declared at such moments that in the interest of this admirable young thing to whom she also declared she had quite come over she was ready to pass with all the world else even with the prince himself the object inconsequently as well of her continued her explicitly shameless appreciation for a vulgar indelicate pestilential woman showing her true character in an abandoned old age the colonel s confessed attention had been enlisted we have seen as never yet under pressure from his wife by any guaranteed imbroglio but this she could assure him she perfectly knew was not a bit because he was sorry for her or touched by what she had let herself in for but because when once they had been opened he couldn t keep his eyes from resting complacently resting almost intelligently on the princess if he was in love with her now however so much the better it would help them both not to wince at what they would have to do for her mrs assingham had come back to that whenever he groaned or grunted she had at no beguiled moment since maggie s little march was positively beguiling let him lose sight of the grim necessity awaiting them we shall have as i ve again and again told you to lie for her to lie till we re black in the face to lie for her the colonel often at these hours as from a vague vision of old chivalry in a new form wandered into apparent lapses from lucidity to lie to her up and down and in and out it comes to the same thing it will consist just as much of lying to the others too to the prince about one s belief in him to charlotte about one s belief in her to mr verver dear sweet man about one s belief in everyone so we ve work cut out with the biggest lie on top of all being that we like to be there for such a purpose we hate it unspeakably i m more ready to be a coward before it to let the whole thing to let everyone selfishly and pusillanimously slide than before any social duty any felt human call that has ever forced me to be decent i speak at least for myself for you she had added as i ve given you so perfect an opportunity to fall in love with maggie you ll doubtless find your account in being so much nearer to her and what do you make the colonel could at this always imperturbably enough ask of the account you yourself will find in being so much nearer to the prince of your confirmed if not exasperated infatuation with whom to say nothing of my weak good nature about it you give such a pretty picture to the picture in question she had been always in fact able contemplatively to return the difficulty of my enjoyment of that is don t you see that i m making in my loyalty to maggie a sad hash of his affection for me you find means to call it then this whitewashing of his crime being loyal to maggie oh about that particular crime there is always much to say it is always more interesting to us than any other crime it has at least that for it but of course i call everything i have in mind at all being loyal to maggie being loyal to her is more than anything else helping her with her father which is what she most wants and needs the colonel had had it before but he could apparently never have too much of it helping her with him helping her against him then against what we ve already so fully talked of its having to be recognised between them that he doubts that s where my part is so plain to see her through to see her through to the end exaltation for the moment always lighted mrs assingham s reference to this plainness yet she at the same time seldom failed the next instant to qualify her view of it when i talk of my obligation as clear i mean that it s absolute for just how from day to day and through thick and thin to keep the thing up is i grant you another matter there s one way luckily nevertheless in which i m strong i can perfectly count on her the colonel seldom failed here as from the insidious growth of an excitement to wonder to encourage not to see you re lying to stick to me fast whatever she sees if i stick to her that is to my own poor struggling way under providence of watching over them all she ll stand by me to the death she won t give me away for you know she easily can this regularly was the most lurid turn of their road but bob assingham with each journey met it as for the first time easily she can utterly dishonour me with her father she can let him know that i was aware at the time of his marriage as i had been aware at the time of her own of the relations that had pre existed between his wife and her husband and how can she do so if up to this minute by your own statement she is herself in ignorance of your knowledge it was a question that mrs assingham had ever for dealing with a manner to which repeated practice had given almost a grand effect very much as if she was invited by it to say that about this exactly she proposed to do her best lying but she said and with full lucidity something quite other it could give itself a little the air still of a triumph over his coarseness by acting immediately with the blind resentment with which in her place ninety nine women out of a hundred would act and by so making mr verver in turn act with the same natural passion the passion of ninety nine men out of a hundred they ve only to agree about me the poor lady said they ve only to feel at one over it feel bitterly practised upon cheated and injured they ve only to denounce me to each other as false and infamous for me to be quite irretrievably dished of course it s i who have been and who continue to be cheated cheated by the prince and charlotte but they re not obliged to give me the benefit of that or to give either of us the benefit of anything they ll be within their rights to lump us all together as a false cruel conspiring crew and if they can find the right facts to support them get rid of us root and branch this on each occasion put the matter so at the worst that repetition even scarce controlled the hot flush with which she was compelled to see the parts of the whole history all its ugly consistency and its temporary gloss hang together she enjoyed invariably the sense of making her danger present of making it real to her husband and of his almost turning pale when their eyes met at this possibility of their compromised state and their shared discredit the beauty was that as under a touch of one of the ivory notes at the left of the keyboard he sounded out with the short sharpness of the dear fond stupid uneasy man conspiring so far as you were concerned to what end why to the obvious end of getting the prince a wife at maggie s expense and then to that of getting charlotte a husband at mr verver s of rendering friendly services yes which have produced as it turns out complications but from the moment you didn t do it for the complications why shouldn t you have rendered them it was extraordinary for her always in this connexion how with time given him he fell to speaking better for her than she could in the presence of her clear cut image of the worst speak for herself troubled as she was she thus never wholly failed of her amusement by the way oh isn t what i may have meddled for so far as it can be proved i did meddle open to interpretation by which i mean to mr verver s and maggie s mayn t they see my motive in the light of that appreciation as the wish to be decidedly more friendly to the others than to the victimised father and daughter she positively liked to keep it up mayn t they see my motive as the determination to serve the prince in any case and at any price first to place him comfortably in other words to find him his fill of money mayn t it have all the air for them of a really equivocal sinister bargain between us something quite unholy and louche it produced in the poor colonel infallibly the echo louche love why haven t you said as much yourself haven t you put your finger on that awful possibility she had a way now with his felicities that made him enjoy being reminded of them in speaking of your having always had such a mash such a mash precisely for the man i was to help to put so splendidly at his ease a motherly mash an impartial look at it would show it only as likely to have been but we re not talking of course about impartial looks we re talking of good innocent people deeply worked upon by a horrid discovery and going much further in their view of the lurid as such people almost always do than those who have been wider awake all round from the first what i was to have got from my friend in such a view in exchange for what i had been able to do for him well that would have been an equivalent of a kind best known to myself for me shrewdly to consider and she easily lost herself each time in the anxious satisfaction of filling out the picture it would have been seen it would have been heard of before the case of the woman a man doesn t want or of whom he s tired or for whom he has no use but such uses and who is capable in her infatuation in her passion of promoting his interests with other women rather than lose sight of him lose touch of him cease to have to do with him at all cela s est vu my dear and stranger things still as i needn t tell you very good then she wound up there is a perfectly possible conception of the behaviour of your sweet wife since as i say there s no imagination so lively once it s started as that of really agitated lambs lions are nothing to them for lions are sophisticated are blases are brought up from the first to prowling and mauling it does give us you ll admit something to think about my relief is luckily however in what i finally do think he was well enough aware by this time of what she finally did think but he was not without a sense again also for his amusement by the way it would have made him for a spectator of these passages between the pair resemble not a little the artless child who hears his favourite story told for the twentieth time and enjoys it exactly because he knows what is next to happen what of course will pull them up if they turn out to have less imagination than you assume is the profit you can have found in furthering mrs verver s marriage you weren t at least in love with charlotte oh mrs assingham at this always brought out my hand in that is easily accounted for by my desire to be agreeable to him to mr verver to the prince by preventing her in that way from taking as he was in danger of seeing her do some husband with whom he wouldn t be able to open to keep open so large an account as with his father in law i ve brought her near him kept her within his reach as she could never have remained either as a single woman or as the wife of a different man kept her on that sweet construction to be his mistress kept her on that sweet construction to be his mistress she brought it out grandly it had always so for her own ear as well as visibly for her husband s its effect the facilities in the case thanks to the particular conditions being so quite ideal down even to the facility of your minding everything so little from your own point of view as to have supplied him with the enjoyment of two beautiful women down even to that to the monstrosity of my folly but not mrs assingham added two of anything one beautiful woman and one beautiful fortune that s what a creature of pure virtue exposes herself to when she suffers her pure virtue suffers her sympathy her disinterestedness her exquisite sense for the lives of others to carry her too far voila i see it s the way the ververs have you it s the way the ververs have me it s in other words the way they would be able to make such a show to each other of having me if maggie weren t so divine she lets you off he never failed to insist on all this to the very end which was how he had become so versed in what she finally thought she lets me off so that now horrified and contrite at what i ve done i may work to help her out and mr verver she was fond of adding lets me off too then you do believe he knows it determined in her always there with a significant pause a deep immersion in her thought i believe he would let me off if he did know so that i might work to help him out or rather really she went on that i might work to help maggie that would be his motive that would be his condition in forgiving me just as hers for me in fact her motive and her condition are my acting to spare her father but it s with maggie only that i m directly concerned nothing ever not a breath not a look i ll guarantee shall i have whatever happens from mr verver himself so it is therefore that i shall probably by the closest possible shave escape the penalty of my crimes you mean being held responsible i mean being held responsible my advantage will be that maggie s such a trump such a trump that as you say she ll stick to you stick to me on our understanding stick to me for our understanding s signed and sealed and to brood over it again was ever for mrs assingham to break out again with exaltation it s a grand high compact she has solemnly promised but in words oh yes in words enough since it s a matter of words to keep up her lie so long as i keep up mine and what do you call her lie why the pretence that she believes me believes they re innocent she positively believes then they re guilty she has arrived at that she s really content with it in the absence of proof it was here each time that fanny assingham most faltered but always at last to get the matter for her own sense and with a long sigh sufficiently straight it isn t a question of belief or of proof absent or present it s inevitably with her a question of natural perception of insurmountable feeling she irresistibly knows that there s something between them but she hasn t arrived at it as you say at all that s exactly what she hasn t done what she so steadily and intensely refuses to do she stands off and off so as not to arrive she keeps out to sea and away from the rocks and what she most wants of me is to keep at a safe distance with her as i for my own skin only ask not to come nearer after which invariably she let him have it all so far from wanting proof which she must get in a manner by my siding with her she wants disproof as against herself and has appealed to me so extraordinarily to side against her it s really magnificent when you come to think of it the spirit of her appeal if i ll but cover them up brazenly enough the others so as to show round and about them as happy as a bird she on her side will do what she can if i ll keep them quiet in a word it will enable her to gain time time as against any idea of her father s and so somehow come out if i ll take care of charlotte in particular she ll take care of the prince and it s beautiful and wonderful really pathetic and exquisite to see what she feels that time may do for her ah but what does she call poor little thing time well this summer at fawns to begin with she can live as yet of course but from hand to mouth but she has worked it out for herself i think that the very danger of fawns superficially looked at may practically amount to a greater protection there the lovers if they are lovers will have to mind they ll feel it for themselves unless things are too utterly far gone with them and things are not too utterly far gone with them she had inevitably poor woman her hesitation for this but she put down her answer as for the purchase of some absolutely indispensable article she would have put down her last shilling no it made him always grin at her is that a lie do you think you re worth lying to if it weren t the truth for me she added i wouldn t have accepted for fawns i can i believe keep the wretches quiet but how at the worst oh the worst don t talk about the worst i can keep them quiet at the best i seem to feel simply by our being there it will work from week to week of itself you ll see he was willing enough to see but he desired to provide yet if it doesn t work ah that s talking about the worst well it might be but what were they doing from morning to night at this crisis but talk who ll keep the others the others who ll keep them quiet if your couple have had a life together they can t have had it completely without witnesses without the help of persons however few who must have some knowledge some idea about them they ve had to meet secretly protectedly they ve had to arrange for if they haven t met and haven t arranged and haven t thereby in some quarter or other had to give themselves away why are we piling it up so therefore if there s evidence up and down london there must be people in possession of it ah it isn t all she always remembered up and down london some of it must connect them i mean she musingly added it naturally would with other places with who knows what strange adventures opportunities dissimulations but whatever there may have been it will also all have been buried on the spot oh they ve known how too beautifully but nothing all the same is likely to find its way to maggie of itself because every one who may have anything to tell you hold will have been so squared and then inveterately before she could say he enjoyed so much coming to this what will have squared lady castledean the consciousness she had never lost her promptness of having no stones to throw at any one else s windows she has enough to do to guard her own glass that was what she was doing fanny said that last morning at matcham when all of us went off and she kept the prince and charlotte over she helped them simply that she might herself be helped if it wasn t perhaps rather with her ridiculous mr blint that he might be they put in together therefore of course that day they got it clear and quite under her eyes inasmuch as they didn t become traceable again as we know till late in the evening on this historic circumstance mrs assingham was always ready afresh to brood but she was no less ready after her brooding devoutly to add only we know nothing whatever else for which all our stars be thanked the colonel s gratitude was apt to be less marked what did they do for themselves all the same from the moment they got that free hand to the moment long after dinner time haven t you told me of their turning up at their respective homes well it s none of your business i don t speak of it as mine but it s only too much theirs people are always traceable in england when tracings are required something sooner or later happens somebody sooner or later breaks the holy calm murder will out murder will but this isn t murder quite the contrary perhaps i verily believe she had her moments of adding that for the amusement of the row you would prefer an explosion this however was a remark he seldom noticed he wound up for the most part after a long contemplative smoke with a transition from which no exposed futility in it had succeeded in weaning him what i can t for my life make out is your idea of the old boy charlotte s too inconceivably funny husband i have no idea i beg your pardon you ve just shown it you never speak of him but as too inconceivably funny well he is she always confessed that is he may be for all i know too inconceivably great but that s not an idea it represents only my weak necessity of feeling that he s beyond me which isn t an idea either you see he may be stupid too precisely there you are yet on the other hand she always went on he may be sublime sublimer even than maggie herself he may in fact have already been but we shall never know with which her tone betrayed perhaps a shade of soreness for the single exemption she didn t yearningly welcome that i can see oh i say it came to affect the colonel himself with a sense of privation i m not sure even that charlotte will oh my dear what charlotte doesn t know but she brooded and brooded i m not sure even that the prince will it seemed privation in short for them all they ll be mystified confounded tormented but they won t know and all their possible putting their heads together won t make them that said fanny assingham will be their punishment and she ended ever when she had come so far at the same pitch it will probably also if i get off with so little be mine and what her husband liked to ask will be mine nothing you re not worthy of any one s punishment is in what one feels and what will make ours effective is that we shall feel she was splendid with her ours she flared up with this prophecy it will be maggie herself who will mete it out maggie she ll know about her father everything everything she repeated on the vision of which each time mrs assingham as with the presentiment of an odd despair turned away from it but she ll never tell us xxxii if maggie had not so firmly made up her mind never to say either to her good friend or to any one else more than she meant about her father she might have found herself betrayed into some such overflow during the week spent in london with her husband after the others had adjourned to fawns for the summer this was because of the odd element of the unnatural imparted to the so simple fact of their brief separation by the assumptions resident in their course of life hitherto she was used herself certainly by this time to dealing with odd elements but she dropped instantly even from such peace as she had patched up when it was a question of feeling that her unpenetrated parent might be alone with them she thought of him as alone with them when she thought of him as alone with charlotte and this strangely enough even while fixing her sense to the full on his wife s power of preserving quite of enhancing every felicitous appearance charlotte had done that under immeasurably fewer difficulties indeed during the numerous months of their hymeneal absence from england the period prior to that wonderful reunion of the couples in the interest of the larger play of all the virtues of each which was now bearing for mrs verver s stepdaughter at least such remarkable fruit it was the present so much briefer interval in a situation possibly in a relation so changed it was the new terms of her problem that would tax charlotte s art the princess could pull herself up repeatedly by remembering that the real relation between her father and his wife was a thing that she knew nothing about and that in strictness was none of her business but she none the less failed to keep quiet as she would have called it before the projected image of their ostensibly happy isolation nothing could have had less of the quality of quietude than a certain queer wish that fitfully flickered up in her a wish that usurped perversely the place of a much more natural one if charlotte while she was about it could only have been worse that idea maggie fell to invoking instead of the idea that she might desirably have been better for exceedingly odd as it was to feel in such ways she believed she mightn t have worried so much if she didn t somehow make her stepmother out under the beautiful trees and among the dear old gardens as lavish of fifty kinds of confidence and twenty kinds at least of gentleness gentleness and confidence were certainly the right thing as from a charming woman to her husband but the fine tissue of reassurance woven by this lady s hands and flung over her companion as a light muffling veil formed precisely a wrought transparency through which she felt her father s eyes continually rest on herself the reach of his gaze came to her straighter from a distance it showed him as still more conscious down there alone of the suspected the felt elaboration of the process of their not alarming or hurting him she had herself now for weeks and weeks and all unwinkingly traced the extension of this pious effort but her perfect success in giving no sign she did herself that credit would have been an achievement quite wasted if mrs verver should make with him those mistakes of proportion one set of them too abruptly too incoherently designed to correct another set that she had made with his daughter however if she had been worse poor woman who should say that her husband would to a certainty have been better one groped noiselessly among such questions and it was actually not even definite for the princess that her own amerigo left alone with her in town had arrived at the golden mean of non precautionary gallantry which would tend by his calculation to brush private criticism from its last perching place the truth was in this connection that she had different sorts of terrors and there were hours when it came to her that these days were a prolonged repetition of that night drive of weeks before from the other house to their own when he had tried to charm her by his sovereign personal power into some collapse that would commit her to a repudiation of consistency she was never alone with him it was to be said without her having sooner or later to ask herself what had already become of her consistency yet at the same time so long as she breathed no charge she kept hold of a remnant of appearance that could save her from attack attack real attack from him as he would conduct it was what she above all dreaded she was so far from sure that under that experience she mightn t drop into some depth of weakness mightn t show him some shortest way with her that he would know how to use again therefore since she had given him as yet no moment s pretext for pretending to her that she had either lost faith or suffered by a feather s weight in happiness she left him it was easy to reason with an immense advantage for all waiting and all tension she wished him for the present to make up to her for nothing who could say to what making up might lead into what consenting or pretending or destroying blindness it might plunge her she loved him too helplessly still to dare to open the door by an inch to his treating her as if either of them had wronged the other something or somebody and who at this which of them all would inevitably would in the gust of momentary selfishness be sacrificed to that whereas what she intelligently needed was to know where she was going knowledge knowledge was a fascination as well as a fear and a part precisely of the strangeness of this juncture was the way her apprehension that he would break out to her with some merely general profession was mixed with her dire need to forgive him to reassure him to respond to him on no ground that she didn t fully measure to do these things it must be clear to her what they were for but to act in that light was by the same effect to learn horribly what the other things had been he might tell her only what he wanted only what would work upon her by the beauty of his appeal and the result of the direct appeal of any beauty in him would be her helpless submission to his terms all her temporary safety her hand to mouth success accordingly was in his neither perceiving nor divining this thanks to such means as she could take to prevent him take literally from hour to hour during these days of more unbroken exposure from hour to hour she fairly expected some sign of his having decided on a jump ah yes it has been as you think i ve strayed away i ve fancied myself free given myself in other quantities with larger generosities because i thought you were different different from what i now see but it was only only because i didn t know and you must admit that you gave me scarce reason enough reason enough i mean to keep clear of my mistake to which i confess for which i ll do exquisite penance which you can help me now i too beautifully feel to get completely over that was what while she watched herself she potentially heard him bring out and while she carried to an end another day another sequence and yet another of their hours together without his producing it she felt herself occupied with him beyond even the intensity of surrender she was keeping her head for a reason for a cause and the labour of this detachment with the labour of her keeping the pitch of it down held them together in the steel hoop of an intimacy compared with which artless passion would have been but a beating of the air her greatest danger or at least her greatest motive for care was the obsession of the thought that if he actually did suspect the fruit of his attention to her couldn t help being a sense of the growth of her importance taking the measure with him as she had taken it with her father of the prescribed reach of her hypocrisy she saw how it would have to stretch even to her seeking to prove that she was not all the same important a single touch from him oh she should know it in case of its coming any brush of his hand of his lips of his voice inspired by recognition of her probable interest as distinct from pity for her virtual gloom would hand her over to him bound hand and foot therefore to be free to be free to act other than abjectly for her father she must conceal from him the validity that like a microscopic insect pushing a grain of sand she was taking on even for herself she could keep it up with a change in sight but she couldn t keep it up forever so that really one extraordinary effect of their week of untempered confrontation which bristled with new marks was to make her reach out in thought to their customary companions and calculate the kind of relief that rejoining them would bring she was learning almost from minute to minute to be a mistress of shades since always when there were possibilities enough of intimacy there were also by that fact in intercourse possibilities of iridescence but she was working against an adversary who was a master of shades too and on whom if she didn t look out she should presently have imposed a consciousness of the nature of their struggle to feel him in fact to think of his feeling himself her adversary in things of this fineness to see him at all in short brave a name that would represent him as in opposition was already to be nearly reduced to a visible smothering of her cry of alarm should he guess they were having in their so occult manner a high fight and that it was she all the while in her supposed stupidity who had made it high and was keeping it high in the event of his doing this before they could leave town she should verily be lost the possible respite for her at fawns would come from the fact that observation in him there would inevitably find some of its directness diverted this would be the case if only because the remarkable strain of her father s placidity might be thought of as likely to claim some larger part of his attention besides which there would be always charlotte herself to draw him off charlotte would help him again doubtless to study anything right or left that might be symptomatic but maggie could see that this very fact might perhaps contribute in its degree to protect the secret of her own fermentation it is not even incredible that she may have discovered the gleam of a comfort that was to broaden in the conceivable effect on the prince s spirit on his nerves on his finer irritability of some of the very airs and aspects the light graces themselves of mrs verver s too perfect competence what it would most come to after all she said to herself was a renewal for him of the privilege of watching that lady watch her very well then with the elements after all so mixed in him how long would he go on enjoying mere spectatorship of that act for she had by this time made up her mind that in charlotte s company he deferred to charlotte s easier art of mounting guard wouldn t he get tired to put it only at that of seeing her always on the rampart erect and elegant with her lace flounced parasol now folded and now shouldered march to and fro against a gold coloured east or west maggie had gone far truly for a view of the question of this particular reaction and she was not incapable of pulling herself up with the rebuke that she counted her chickens before they were hatched how sure she should have to be of so many things before she might thus find a weariness in amerigo s expression and a logic in his weariness one of her dissimulated arts for meeting their tension meanwhile was to interweave mrs assingham as plausibly as possible with the undulations of their surface to bring it about that she should join them of an afternoon when they drove together or if they went to look at things looking at things being almost as much a feature of their life as if they were bazaar opening royalties then there were such combinations later in the day as her attendance on them and the colonel s as well for such whimsical matters as visits to the opera no matter who was singing and sudden outbreaks of curiosity about the british drama the good couple from cadogan place could always unprotestingly dine with them and go on afterwards to such publicities as the princess cultivated the boldness of now perversely preferring it may be said of her that during these passages she plucked her sensations by the way detached nervously the small wild blossoms of her dim forest so that she could smile over them at least with the spacious appearance for her companions for her husband above all of bravely of altogether frivolously going a maying she had her intense her smothered excitements some of which were almost inspirations she had in particular the extravagant positively at moments the amused sense of using her friend to the topmost notch accompanied with the high luxury of not having to explain never no never should she have to explain to fanny assingham again who poor woman on her own side would be charged it might be forever with that privilege of the higher ingenuity she put it all off on fanny and the dear thing herself might henceforth appraise the quantity more and more magnificent now in her blameless egoism maggie asked no questions of her and thus only signified the greatness of the opportunity she gave her she didn t care for what devotions what dinners of their own the assinghams might have been booked that was a detail and she could think without wincing of the ruptures and rearrangements to which her service condemned them it all fell in beautifully moreover so that as hard at this time in spite of her fever as a little pointed diamond the princess showed something of the glitter of consciously possessing the constructive the creative hand she had but to have the fancy of presenting herself of presenting her husband in a certain high and convenient manner to make it natural they should go about with their gentleman and their lady to what else but this exactly had charlotte during so many weeks of the earlier season worked her up herself assuming and discharging so far as might be the character and office of one of those revolving subordinate presences that float in the wake of greatness the precedent was therefore established and the group normally constituted mrs assingham meanwhile at table on the stairs in the carriage or the opera box might with her constant overflow of expression for that matter and its singularly resident character where men in especial were concerned look across at amerigo in whatever sense she liked it was not of that maggie proposed to be afraid she might warn him she might rebuke him she might reassure him she might if it were impossible not to absolutely make love to him even this was open to her as a matter simply between them if it would help her to answer for the impeccability he had guaranteed and maggie desired in fact only to strike her as acknowledging the efficacy of her aid when she mentioned to her one evening a small project for the morrow privately entertained the idea irresistible intense of going to pay at the museum a visit to mr crichton mr crichton as mrs assingham could easily remember was the most accomplished and obliging of public functionaries whom every one knew and who knew every one who had from the first in particular lent himself freely and for the love of art and history to becoming one of the steadier lights of mr verver s adventurous path the custodian of one of the richest departments of the great national collection of precious things he could feel for the sincere private collector and urge him on his way even when condemned to be present at his capture of trophies sacrificed by the country to parliamentary thrift he carried his amiability to the point of saying that since london under pettifogging views had to miss from time to time its rarest opportunities he was almost consoled to see such lost causes invariably wander at last one by one with the tormenting tinkle of their silver bells into the wondrous the already famous fold beyond the mississippi there was a charm in his almosts that was not to be resisted especially after mr verver and maggie had grown sure or almost again of enjoying the monopoly of them and on this basis of envy changed to sympathy by the more familiar view of the father and the daughter mr crichton had at both houses though especially in eaton square learned to fill out the responsive and suggestive character it was at his invitation fanny well recalled that maggie one day long before and under her own attendance precisely had for the glory of the name she bore paid a visit to one of the ampler shrines of the supreme exhibitory temple an alcove of shelves charged with the gold and brown gold and ivory of old italian bindings and consecrated to the records of the prince s race it had been an impression that penetrated that remained yet maggie had sighed ever so prettily at its having to be so superficial she was to go back some day to dive deeper to linger and taste in spite of which however mrs assingham could not recollect perceiving that the visit had been repeated this second occasion had given way for a long time in her happy life to other occasions all testifying in their degree to the quality of her husband s blood its rich mixture and its many remarkable references after which no doubt the charming piety involved had grown on still further grounds bewildered and faint it now appeared none the less that some renewed conversation with mr crichton had breathed on the faintness revivingly and maggie mentioned her purpose as a conception of her very own to the success of which she designed to devote her morning visits of gracious ladies under his protection lighted up rosily for this perhaps most flower loving and honey sipping member of the great bloomsbury hive its packed passages and cells and though not sworn of the province toward which his friend had found herself according to her appeal to him yearning again nothing was easier for him than to put her in relation with the presiding urbanities so it had been settled maggie said to mrs assingham and she was to dispense with amerigo s company fanny was to remember later on that she had at first taken this last fact for one of the finer notes of her young woman s detachment imagined she must be going alone because of the shade of irony that in these ambiguous days her husband s personal presence might be felt to confer practically on any tribute to his transmitted significance then as the next moment she felt it clear that so much plotted freedom was virtually a refinement of reflection an impulse to commemorate afresh whatever might still survive of pride and hope her sense of ambiguity happily fell and she congratulated her companion on having anything so exquisite to do and on being so exquisitely in the humour to do it after the occasion had come and gone she was confirmed in her optimism she made out in the evening that the hour spent among the projected lights the annals and illustrations the parchments and portraits the emblazoned volumes and the murmured commentary had been for the princess enlarging and inspiring maggie had said to her some days before very sweetly but very firmly invite us to dine please for friday and have any one you like or you can it doesn t in the least matter whom and the pair in cadogan place had bent to this mandate with a docility not in the least ruffled by all that it took for granted it provided for an evening this had been maggie s view and she lived up to her view in her friend s eyes by treating the occasion more or less explicitly as new and strange the good assinghams had feasted in fact at the two other boards on a scale so disproportionate to the scant solicitations of their own that it was easy to make a joke of seeing how they fed at home how they met themselves the question of giving to eat maggie dined with them in short and arrived at making her husband appear to dine much in the manner of a pair of young sovereigns who have in the frolic humour of the golden years of reigns proposed themselves to a pair of faithfully serving subjects she showed an interest in their arrangements an inquiring tenderness almost for their economies so that her hostess not unnaturally as they might have said put it all down the tone and the freedom of which she set the example to the effect wrought in her afresh by one of the lessons learned in the morning at the altar of the past hadn t she picked it up from an anecdote or two offered again to her attention that there were for princesses of such a line more ways than one of being a heroine maggie s way to night was to surprise them all truly by the extravagance of her affability she was doubtless not positively boisterous yet though mrs assingham as a bland critic had never doubted her being graceful she had never seen her put so much of it into being what might have been called assertive it was all a tune to which fanny s heart could privately palpitate her guest was happy happy as a consequence of something that had occurred but she was making the prince not lose a ripple of her laugh though not perhaps always enabling him to find it absolutely not foolish foolish in public beyond a certain point he was scarce the man to brook his wife s being thought to be so that there hovered before their friend the possibility of some subsequent scene between them in the carriage or at home of slightly sarcastic inquiry of promptly invited explanation a scene that according as maggie should play her part in it might or might not precipitate developments what made these appearances practically thrilling meanwhile was this mystery a mystery it was clear to amerigo himself of the incident or the influence that had so peculiarly determined them the lady of cadogan place was to read deeper however within three days and the page was turned for her on the eve of her young confidant s leaving london the awaited migration to fawns was to take place on the morrow and it was known meanwhile to mrs assingham that their party of four were to dine that night at the american embassy with another and a larger party so that the elder woman had a sense of surprise on receiving from the younger under date of six o clock a telegram requesting her immediate attendance please come to me at once dress early if necessary so that we shall have time the carriage ordered for us will take you back first mrs assingham on quick deliberation dressed though not perhaps with full lucidity and by seven o clock was in portland place where her friend upstairs and described to her on her arrival as herself engaged in dressing instantly received her she knew on the spot poor fanny as she was afterwards to declare to the colonel that her feared crisis had popped up as at the touch of a spring that her impossible hour was before her her impossible hour was the hour of its coming out that she had known of old so much more than she had ever said and she had often put it to herself in apprehension she tried to think even in preparation that she should recognise the approach of her doom by a consciousness akin to that of the blowing open of a window on some night of the highest wind and the lowest thermometer it would be all in vain to have crouched so long by the fire the glass would have been smashed the icy air would fill the place if the air in maggie s room then on her going up was not as yet quite the polar blast she had expected it was distinctly none the less such an atmosphere as they had not hitherto breathed together the princess she perceived was completely dressed that business was over it added indeed to the effect of her importantly awaiting the assistance she had summoned of her showing a deck cleared so to speak for action her maid had already left her and she presented herself in the large clear room where everything was admirable but where nothing was out of place as for the first time in her life rather bedizened was it that she had put on too many things overcharged herself with jewels wore in particular more of them than usual and bigger ones in her hair a question her visitor presently answered by attributing this appearance largely to the bright red spot red as some monstrous ruby that burned in either of her cheeks these two items of her aspect had promptly enough their own light for mrs assingham who made out by it that nothing more pathetic could be imagined than the refuge and disguise her agitation had instinctively asked of the arts of dress multiplied to extravagance almost to incoherence she had had visibly her idea that of not betraying herself by inattentions into which she had never yet fallen and she stood there circled about and furnished forth as always in a manner that testified to her perfect little personal processes it had ever been her sign that she was for all occasions found ready without loose ends or exposed accessories or unremoved superfluities a suggestion of the swept and garnished in her whole splendid yet thereby more or less encumbered and embroidered setting that reflected her small still passion for order and symmetry for objects with their backs to the walls and spoke even of some probable reference in her american blood to dusting and polishing new england grandmothers if her apartment was princely in the clearness of the lingering day she looked as if she had been carried there prepared all attired and decorated like some holy image in a procession and left precisely to show what wonder she could work under pressure her friend felt how could she not as the truly pious priest might feel when confronted behind the altar before the festa with his miraculous madonna such an occasion would be grave in general with all the gravity of what he might look for but the gravity to night would be of the rarest what he might look for would depend so on what he could give xxxiii something very strange has happened and i think you ought to know it maggie spoke this indeed without extravagance yet with the effect of making her guest measure anew the force of her appeal it was their definite understanding whatever fanny knew fanny s faith would provide for and she knew accordingly at the end of five minutes what the extraordinary in the late occurrence had consisted of and how it had all come of maggie s achieved hour under mr crichton s protection at the museum he had desired mr crichton with characteristic kindness after the wonderful show after offered luncheon at his incorporated lodge hard by to see her safely home especially on his noting in attending her to the great steps that she had dismissed her carriage which she had done really just for the harmless amusement of taking her way alone she had known she should find herself as the consequence of such an hour in a sort of exalted state under the influence of which a walk through the london streets would be exactly what would suit her best an independent ramble impressed excited contented with nothing to mind and nobody to talk to and shop windows in plenty to look at if she liked a low taste of the essence it was to be supposed of her nature that she had of late for so many reasons been unable to gratify she had taken her leave with her thanks she knew her way quite enough it being also sufficiently the case that she had even a shy hope of not going too straight to wander a little wild was what would truly amuse her so that keeping clear of oxford street and cultivating an impression as of parts she didn t know she had ended with what she had more or less had been fancying an encounter with three or four shops an old bookseller s an old printmonger s a couple of places with dim antiquities in the window that were not as so many of the other shops those in sloane street say a hollow parade which had long since ceased to beguile there had remained with her moreover an allusion of charlotte s of some months before seed dropped into her imagination in the form of a casual speech about there being in bloomsbury such funny little fascinating places and even sometimes such unexpected finds there could perhaps have been no stronger mark than this sense of well nigh romantic opportunity no livelier sign of the impression made on her and always so long retained so watchfully nursed by any observation of charlotte s however lightly thrown off and then she had felt somehow more at her ease than for months and months before she didn t know why but her time at the museum oddly had done it it was as if she hadn t come into so many noble and beautiful associations nor secured them also for her boy secured them even for her father only to see them turn to vanity and doubt turn possibly to something still worse i believed in him again as much as ever and i felt how i believed in him she said with bright fixed eyes i felt it in the streets as i walked along and it was as if that helped me and lifted me up my being off by myself there not having for the moment to wonder and watch having on the contrary almost nothing on my mind it was so much as if everything would come out right that she had fallen to thinking of her father s birthday had given herself this as a reason for trying what she could pick up for it they would keep it at fawns where they had kept it before since it would be the twenty first of the month and she mightn t have another chance of making sure of something to offer him there was always the impossibility of course of finding him anything the least bit good that he wouldn t already long ago in his rummagings have seen himself and only not to think a quarter good enough this however was an old story and one could not have had any fun with him but for his sweet theory that the individual gift the friendship s offering was by a rigorous law of nature a foredoomed aberration and that the more it was so the more it showed and the more one cherished it for showing how friendly it had been the infirmity of art was the candour of affection the grossness of pedigree the refinement of sympathy the ugliest objects in fact as a general thing were the bravest the tenderest mementos and as such figured in glass cases apart worthy doubtless of the home but not worthy of the temple dedicated to the grimacing not to the clear faced gods she herself naturally through the past years had come to be much represented in those receptacles against the thick locked panes of which she still liked to flatten her nose finding in its place each time everything she had on successive anniversaries tried to believe he might pretend at her suggestion to be put off with or at least think curious she was now ready to try it again they had always with his pleasure in her pretence and her pleasure in his with the funny betrayal of the sacrifice to domestic manners on either side played the game so happily to this end on her way home she had loitered everywhere quite too deludedly among the old books and the old prints which had yielded nothing to her purpose but with a strange inconsequence in one of the other shops that of a small antiquarian a queer little foreign man who had shown her a number of things shown her finally something that struck with it as rather a rarity and thinking it would compared to some of her ventures quite superlatively do she had bought bought really when it came to that for a price it appears now it won t do at all said maggie something has happened since that puts it quite out of the question i had only my day of satisfaction in it but i feel at the same time as i keep it here before me that i wouldn t have missed it for the world she had talked from the first of her friend s entrances coherently enough even with a small quaver that overstated her calm but she held her breath every few seconds as if for deliberation and to prove she didn t pant all of which marked for fanny the depth of her commotion her reference to her thought about her father about her chance to pick up something that might divert him her mention in fine of his fortitude under presents having meanwhile naturally it should be said much less an amplitude of insistence on the speaker s lips than a power to produce on the part of the listener herself the prompt response and full comprehension of memory and sympathy of old amused observation the picture was filled out by the latter s fond fancy but maggie was at any rate under arms she knew what she was doing and had already her plan a plan for making for allowing as yet no difference in accordance with which she would still dine out and not with red eyes nor convulsed features nor neglected items of appearance nor anything that would raise a question yet there was some knowledge that exactly to this support of her not breaking down she desired she required possession of and with the sinister rise and fall of lightning unaccompanied by thunder it played before mrs assingham s eyes that she herself should have at whatever risk or whatever cost to supply her with the stuff of her need all our friend s instinct was to hold off from this till she should see what the ground would bear she would take no step nearer unless intelligibly to meet her and awkward though it might be to hover there only pale and distorted with mere imbecilities of vagueness there was a quality of bald help in the fact of not as yet guessing what such an ominous start could lead to she caught however after a second s thought at the princess s allusion to her lost reassurance you mean you were so at your ease on monday the night you dined with us i was very happy then said maggie yes we thought you so gay and so brilliant fanny felt it feeble but she went on we were so glad you were happy maggie stood a moment at first only looking at her you thought me all right eh surely dearest we thought you all right well i daresay it was natural but in point of fact i never was more wrong in my life for all the while if you please this was brewing mrs assingham indulged as nearly as possible to luxury her vagueness this that replied the princess whose eyes her companion now saw had turned to an object on the chimney piece of the room of which among so many precious objects the ververs wherever they might be always revelled peculiarly in matchless old mantel ornaments her visitor had not taken heed do you mean the gilt cup i mean the gilt cup the piece now recognised by fanny as new to her own vision was a capacious bowl of old looking rather strikingly yellow gold mounted by a short stem on an ample foot which held a central position above the fire place where to allow it the better to show a clearance had been made of other objects notably of the louis seize clock that accompanied the candelabra this latter trophy ticked at present on the marble slab of a commode that exactly matched it in splendour and style mrs assingham took it the bowl as a fine thing but the question was obviously not of its intrinsic value and she kept off from it admiring it at a distance but what has that to do it has everything you ll see with which again however for the moment maggie attached to her strange wide eyes he knew her before before i had ever seen him he knew but fanny while she cast about her for the links she missed could only echo it amerigo knew charlotte more than i ever dreamed fanny felt then it was stare for stare but surely you always knew they had met i didn t understand i knew too little don t you see what i mean the princess asked mrs assingham wondered during these instants how much she even now knew it had taken a minute to perceive how gently she was speaking with that perception of its being no challenge of wrath no heat of the deceived soul but only a free exposure of the completeness of past ignorance inviting derision even if it must the elder woman felt first a strange barely credible relief she drew in as if it had been the warm summer scent of a flower the sweet certainty of not meeting any way she should turn any consequence of judgment she shouldn t be judged save by herself which was her own wretched business the next moment however at all events she blushed within for her immediate cowardice she had thought of herself thought of getting off before so much as thinking that is of pitifully seeing that she was in presence of an appeal that was all an appeal that utterly accepted its necessity in a general way dear child yes but not a in connexion with what you ve been telling me they were intimate you see intimate said the princess fanny continued to face her taking from her excited eyes this history so dim and faint for all her anxious emphasis of the far away other time there s always the question of what one considers what one considers intimate well i know what i consider intimate now too intimate said maggie to let me know anything about it it was quiet yes but not too quiet for fanny assingham s capacity to wince only compatible with letting me you mean she had asked it after a pause but turning again to the new ornament of the chimney and wondering even while she took relief from it at this gap in her experience but here are things my dear of which my ignorance is perfect they went about together they re known to have done it and i don t mean only before i mean after after said fanny assingham before we were married yes but after we were engaged ah i ve known nothing about that and she said it with a braver assurance clutching with comfort at something that was apparently new to her that bowl maggie went on is so strangely too strangely almost to believe at this time of day the proof they were together all the while up to the very eve of our marriage don t you remember how just before that she came back so unexpectedly from america the question had for mrs assingham and whether all consciously or not the oddest pathos of simplicity oh yes dear of course i remember how she came back from america and how she stayed with us and what view one had of it maggie s eyes still all the time pressed and penetrated so that during a moment just here she might have given the little flare have made the little pounce of asking what then one s view had been to the small flash of this eruption fanny stood for her minute wittingly exposed but she saw it as quickly cease to threaten quite saw the princess even though in all her pain refuse in the interest of their strange and exalted bargain to take advantage of the opportunity for planting the stab of reproach the opportunity thus coming all of itself she saw her or she believed she saw her look at her chance for straight denunciation look at it and then pass it by and she felt herself with this fact hushed well nigh to awe at the lucid higher intention that no distress could confound and that no discovery since it was however obscurely a case of discovery could make less needful these seconds were brief they rapidly passed but they lasted long enough to renew our friend s sense of her own extraordinary undertaking the function again imposed on her the answerability again drilled into her by this intensity of intimation she was reminded of the terms on which she was let off her quantity of release having made its sufficient show in that recall of her relation to charlotte s old reappearance and deep within the whole impression glowed ah so inspiringly when it came to that her steady view clear from the first of the beauty of her companion s motive it was like a fresh sacrifice for a larger conquest only see me through now do it in the face of this and in spite of it and i leave you a hand of which the freedom isn t to be said the aggravation of fear or call it apparently of knowledge had jumped straight into its place as an aggravation above all for her father the effect of this being but to quicken to passion her reasons for making his protectedness or in other words the forms of his ignorance still the law of her attitude and the key to her solution she kept as tight hold of these reasons and these forms in her confirmed horror as the rider of a plunging horse grasps his seat with his knees and she might absolutely have been putting it to her guest that she believed she could stay on if they should only meet nothing more though ignorant still of what she had definitely met fanny yearned within over her spirit and so no word about it said passed through mere pitying eyes a vow to walk ahead and at crossroads with a lantern for the darkness and wavings away for unadvised traffic look out for alarms there was accordingly no wait in maggie s reply they spent together hours spent at least a morning the certainty of which has come back to me now but that i didn t dream of it at the time that cup there has turned witness by the most wonderful of chances that s why since it has been here i ve stood it out for my husband to see put it where it would meet him almost immediately if he should come into the room i ve wanted it to meet him she went on and i ve wanted him to meet it and to be myself present at the meeting but that hasn t taken place as yet often as he has lately been in the way of coming to see me here yes in particular lately he hasn t showed to day it was with her managed quietness more and more that she talked an achieved coherence that helped her evidently to hear and to watch herself there was support and thereby an awful harmony but which meant a further guidance in the facts she could add together it s quite as if he had an instinct something that has warned him off or made him uneasy he doesn t quite know naturally what has happened but guesses with his beautiful cleverness that something has and isn t in a hurry to be confronted with it so in his vague fear he keeps off but being meanwhile in the house i ve no idea not having seen him to day by exception since before luncheon he spoke to me then the princess freely explained of a ballot of great importance at a club for somebody some personal friend i think who s coming up and is supposed to be in danger to make an effort for him he thought he had better lunch there you see the efforts he can make for which maggie found a smile that went to her friend s heart he s in so many ways the kindest of men but it was hours ago mrs assingham thought the more danger then of his coming in and finding me here i don t know you see what you now consider that you ve ascertained nor anything of the connexion with it of that object that you declare so damning her eyes rested on this odd acquisition and then quitted it went back to it and again turned from it it was inscrutable in its rather stupid elegance and yet from the moment one had thus appraised it vivid and definite in its domination of the scene fanny could no more overlook it now than she could have overlooked a lighted christmas tree but nervously and all in vain she dipped into her mind for some floating reminiscence of it at the same time that this attempt left her blank she understood a good deal she even not a little shared the prince s mystic apprehension the golden bowl put on under consideration a sturdy a conscious perversity as a document somehow it was ugly though it might have a decorative grace his finding me here in presence of it might be more flagrantly disagreeable for all of us than you intend or than would necessarily help us and i must take time truly to understand what it means you re safe as far as that goes maggie returned you may take it from me that he won t come in and that i shall only find him below waiting for me when i go down to the carriage fanny assingham took it from her took it and more we re to sit together at the ambassador s then or at least you two are with this new complication thrust up before you all unexplained and to look at each other with faces that pretend for the ghastly hour not to be seeing it maggie looked at her with a face that might have been the one she was preparing unexplained my dear quite the contrary explained fully intensely admirably explained with nothing really to add my own love she kept it up i don t want anything more i ve plenty to go upon and to do with as it is fanny assingham stood there in her comparative darkness with her links verily still missing but the most acceptable effect of this was singularly as yet a cold fear of getting nearer the fact but when you come home i mean he ll come up with you again won t he see it then on which maggie gave her after an instant s visible thought the strangest of slow headshakes i don t know perhaps he ll never see it if it only stands there waiting for him he may never again said the princess come into this room fanny more deeply wondered never again oh yes it may be how do i know with this she quietly went on she had not looked again at the incriminating piece but there was a marvel to her friend in the way the little word representing it seemed to express and include for her the whole of her situation then you intend not to speak to him maggie waited to speak well about your having it and about what you consider that it represents oh i don t know that i shall speak if he doesn t but his keeping away from me because of that what will that be but to speak he can t say or do more it won t be for me to speak maggie added in a different tone one of the tones that had already so penetrated her guest it will be for me to listen mrs assingham turned it over then it all depends on that object that you regard for your reasons as evidence i think i may say that i depend on it i can t said maggie treat it as nothing now mrs assingham at this went closer to the cup on the chimney quite liking to feel that she did so moreover without going closer to her companion s vision she looked at the precious thing if precious it was found herself in fact eyeing it as if by her dim solicitation to draw its secret from it rather than suffer the imposition of maggie s knowledge it was brave and rich and firm with its bold deep hollow and without this queer torment about it would thanks to her love of plenty of yellow figure to her as an enviable ornament a possession really desirable she didn t touch it but if after a minute she turned away from it the reason was rather oddly and suddenly in her fear of doing so then it all depends on the bowl i mean your future does for that s what it comes to i judge what it comes to maggie presently returned is what that thing has put me so almost miraculously in the way of learning how far they had originally gone together if there was so much between them before there can t with all the other appearances not be a great deal more now and she went on and on she steadily made her points if such things were already then between them they make all the difference for possible doubt of what may have been between them since if there had been nothing before there might be explanations but it makes to day too much to explain i mean to explain away she said fanny assingham was there to explain away of this she was duly conscious for that at least had been true up to now in the light however of maggie s demonstration the quantity even without her taking as yet a more exact measure might well seem larger than ever besides which with or without exactness the effect of each successive minute in the place was to put her more in presence of what maggie herself saw maggie herself saw the truth and that was really while they remained there together enough for mrs assingham s relation to it there was a force in the princess s mere manner about it that made the detail of what she knew a matter of minor importance fanny had in fact something like a momentary shame over her own need of asking for this detail i don t pretend to repudiate she said after a little my own impressions of the different times i suppose you speak of any more she added than i can forget what difficulties and as it constantly seemed to me what dangers every course of action whatever i should decide upon made for me i tried i tried hard to act for the best and you know she next pursued while at the sound of her own statement a slow courage and even a faint warmth of conviction came back to her and you know i believe it s what i shall turn out to have done this produced a minute during which their interchange though quickened and deepened was that of silence only and the long charged look all of which found virtual consecration when maggie at last spoke i m sure you tried to act for the best it kept fanny assingham again a minute in silence i never thought dearest you weren t an angel not however that this alone was much help it was up to the very eve you see the princess went on up to within two or three days of our marriage that that you know and she broke down for strangely smiling yes as i say it was while she was with me but i didn t know it that is said fanny assingham i didn t know of anything in particular it sounded weak that she felt but she had really her point to make what i mean is that i don t know for knowledge now anything i didn t then that s how i am she still however floundered i mean it s how i was but don t they how you were and how you are maggie asked come practically to the same thing the elder woman s words had struck her own ear as in the tone now mistimed of their recent but all too factitious understanding arrived at in hours when as there was nothing susceptible of proof there was nothing definitely to disprove the situation had changed by well by whatever there was by the outbreak of the definite and this could keep maggie at least firm she was firm enough as she pursued it was on the whole thing that amerigo married me with which her eyes had their turn again at her damnatory piece and it was on that it was on that but they came back to her visitor and it was on it all that father married her her visitor took it as might be they both married ah that you must believe with the highest intentions father did certainly and then at the renewal of this consciousness it all rolled over her ah to thrust such things on us to do them here between us and with us day after day and in return in return to do it to him to him to him fanny hesitated you mean it s for him you most suffer and then as the princess after a look but turned away moving about the room which made the question somehow seem a blunder i ask she continued because i think everything everything we now speak of may be for him really may be made for him quite as if it hadn t been but maggie had the next moment faced about as if without hearing her father did it for me did it all and only for me mrs assingham with a certain promptness threw up her head but she faltered again before she spoke well it was only an intended word but maggie showed after an instant that it had reached her do you mean that that s the reason that that s a reason fanny at first however feeling the response in this didn t say all she meant she said for the moment something else instead he did it for you largely at least for you and it was for you that i did in my smaller interested way well what i could do for i could do something she continued i thought i saw your interest as he himself saw it and i thought i saw charlotte s i believed in her and i believed in her said maggie mrs assingham waited again but she presently pushed on she believed then in herself ah maggie murmured something exquisite faintly eager in the prompt simplicity of it supported her friend further and the prince believed his belief was real just as he believed in himself maggie spent a minute in taking it from her he believed in himself just as i too believed in him for i absolutely did maggie to which fanny then added and i believe in him yet i mean she subjoined well i mean i do maggie again took it from her after which she was again restlessly set afloat then when this had come to an end and do you believe in charlotte yet mrs assingham had a demur that she felt she could now afford we ll talk of charlotte some other day they both at any rate thought themselves safe at the time then why did they keep from me everything i might have known her friend bent upon her the mildest eyes why did i myself keep it from you oh you weren t for honour obliged dearest maggie the poor woman broke out on this you are divine they pretended to love me the princess went on and they pretended to love him and pray what was there that i didn t pretend not at any rate to care for me as you cared for amerigo and for charlotte they were much more interesting it was perfectly natural how couldn t you like amerigo maggie continued mrs assingham gave it up how couldn t i how couldn t i then with a fine freedom she went all her way how can t i how can t i it fixed afresh maggie s wide eyes on her i see i see well it s beautiful for you to be able to and of course she added you wanted to help charlotte yes fanny considered it i wanted to help charlotte but i wanted also you see to help you by not digging up a past that i believed with so much on top of it solidly buried i wanted as i still want she richly declared to help every one it set maggie once more in movement movement which however spent itself again with a quick emphasis then it s a good deal my fault if everything really began so well fanny assingham met it as she could you ve been only too perfect you ve thought only too much but the princess had already caught at the words yes i ve thought only too much yet she appeared to continue for the minute full of that fault she had it in fact by this prompted thought all before her of him dear man of him her friend able to take in thus directly her vision of her father watched her with a new suspense that way might safety lie it was like a wider chink of light he believed with a beauty in charlotte yes and it was i who had made him believe i didn t mean to at the time so much for i had no idea then of what was coming but i did it i did it the princess declared with a beauty ah with a beauty you too mrs assingham insisted maggie however was seeing for herself it was another matter the thing was that he made her think it would be so possible fanny again hesitated the prince made her think maggie stared she had meant her father but her vision seemed to spread they both made her think she wouldn t have thought without them yet amerigo s good faith mrs assingham insisted was perfect and there was nothing all the more she added against your father s the remark however kept maggie for a moment still nothing perhaps but his knowing that she knew knew that he was doing it so much for me to what extent she suddenly asked of her friend do you think he was aware that she knew ah who can say what passes between people in such a relation the only thing one can be sure of is that he was generous and mrs assingham conclusively smiled he doubtless knew as much as was right for himself as much that is as was right for her yes then as was right for her the point is fanny declared that whatever his knowledge it made all the way it went for his good faith maggie continued to gaze and her friend now fairly waited on her successive movements isn t the point very considerably that his good faith must have been his faith in her taking almost as much interest in me as he himself took fanny assingham thought he recognised he adopted your long friendship but he founded on it no selfishness no said maggie with still deeper consideration he counted her selfishness out almost as he counted his own so you may say very well maggie went on if he had none of his own he invited her may have expected her on her side to have as little and she may only since have found that out mrs assingham looked blank since and he may have become aware maggie pursued that she has found it out that she has taken the measure since their marriage she explained of how much he had asked of her more say than she had understood at the time he may have made out at last how such a demand was in the long run to affect her he may have done many things mrs assingham responded but there s one thing he certainly won t have done he ll never have shown that he expected of her a quarter as much as she must have understood he was to give i ve often wondered maggie mused what charlotte really understood but it s one of the things she has never told me then as it s one of the things she has never told me either we shall probably never know it and we may regard it as none of our business there are many things said mrs assingham that we shall never know maggie took it in with a long reflection never but there are others her friend went on that stare us in the face and that under whatever difficulty you may feel you labour may now be enough for us your father has been extraordinary it had been as if maggie were feeling her way but she rallied to this with a rush extraordinary magnificent said fanny assingham her companion held tight to it magnificent then he ll do for himself whatever there may be to do what he undertook for you he ll do to the end he didn t undertake it to break down in what quiet patient exquisite as he is did he ever break down he had never in his life proposed to himself to have failed and he won t have done it on this occasion ah this occasion and maggie s wail showed her of a sudden thrown back on it am i in the least sure that with everything he even knows what it is and yet am i in the least sure he doesn t if he doesn t then so much the better leave him alone do you mean give him up leave her fanny assingham went on leave her to him maggie looked at her darkly do you mean leave him to her after this after everything aren t they for that matter intimately together now intimately how do i know but fanny kept it up aren t you and your husband in spite of everything maggie s eyes still further if possible dilated it remains to be seen if you re not then where s your faith in my husband mrs assingham but for an instant hesitated in your father it all comes back to that rest on it on his ignorance fanny met it again on whatever he may offer you take that take it maggie stared mrs assingham held up her head and be grateful on which for a minute she let the princess face her do you see i see said maggie at last then there you are but maggie had turned away moving to the window as if still to keep something in her face from sight she stood there with her eyes on the street while mrs assingham s reverted to that complicating object on the chimney as to which her condition so oddly even to herself was that both of recurrent wonder and recurrent protest she went over it looked at it afresh and yielded now to her impulse to feel it in her hands she laid them on it lifting it up and was surprised thus with the weight of it she had seldom handled so much massive gold that effect itself somehow prompted her to further freedom and presently to saying i don t believe in this you know it brought maggie round to her don t believe in it you will when i tell you ah tell me nothing i won t have it said mrs assingham she kept the cup in her hand held it there in a manner that gave maggie s attention to her she saw the next moment a quality of excited suspense this suggested to her oddly that she had with the liberty she was taking an air of intention and the impression betrayed by her companion s eyes grew more distinct in a word of warning it s of value but its value s impaired i ve learned by a crack a crack in the gold it isn t gold with which somewhat strangely maggie smiled that s the point what is it then it s glass and cracked under the gilt as i say at that glass of this weight well said maggie it s crystal and was once i suppose precious but what she then asked do you mean to do with it she had come away from her window one of the three by which the wide room enjoying an advantageous back commanded the western sky and caught a glimpse of the evening flush while mrs assingham possessed of the bowl and possessed too of this indication of a flaw approached another for the benefit of the slowly fading light here thumbing the singular piece weighing it turning it over and growing suddenly more conscious above all of an irresistible impulse she presently spoke again a crack then your whole idea has a crack maggie by this time at some distance from her waited a moment if you mean by my idea the knowledge that has come to me that but fanny with decision had already taken her up there s only one knowledge that concerns us one fact with which we can have anything to do which one then the fact that your husband has never never never but the very gravity of this statement while she raised her eyes to her friend across the room made her for an instant hang fire well never what never been half so interested in you as now but don t you my dear really feel it maggie considered oh i think what i ve told you helps me to feel it his having to day given up even his forms his keeping away from me his not having come and she shook her head as against all easy glosses it is because of that you know well then if it s because of this and fanny assingham who had been casting about her and whose inspiration decidedly had come raised the cup in her two hands raised it positively above her head and from under it solemnly smiled at the princess as a signal of intention so for an instant full of her thought and of her act she held the precious vessel and then with due note taken of the margin of the polished floor bare fine and hard in the embrasure of her window she dashed it boldly to the ground where she had the thrill of seeing it with the violence of the crash lie shattered she had flushed with the force of her effort as maggie had flushed with wonder at the sight and this high reflection in their faces was all that passed between them for a minute more after which whatever you meant by it and i don t want to know now has ceased to exist mrs assingham said and what in the world my dear did you mean by it that sound as at the touch of a spring rang out as the first effect of fanny s speech it broke upon the two women s absorption with a sharpness almost equal to the smash of the crystal for the door of the room had been opened by the prince without their taking heed he had apparently had time moreover to catch the conclusion of fanny s act his eyes attached themselves through the large space allowing just there as happened a free view to the shining fragments at this lady s feet his question had been addressed to his wife but he moved his eyes immediately afterwards to those of her visitor whose own then held them in a manner of which neither party had been capable doubtless for mute penetration since the hour spent by him in cadogan place on the eve of his marriage and the afternoon of charlotte s reappearance something now again became possible for these communicants under the intensity of their pressure something that took up that tale and that might have been a redemption of pledges then exchanged this rapid play of suppressed appeal and disguised response lasted indeed long enough for more results than one long enough for mrs assingham to measure the feat of quick self recovery possibly therefore of recognition still more immediate accompanying amerigo s vision and estimate of the evidence with which she had been so admirably she felt as she looked at him inspired to deal she looked at him and looked at him there were so many things she wanted on the spot to say but maggie was looking too and was moreover looking at them both so that these things for the elder woman quickly enough reduced themselves to one she met his question not too late since in their silence it had remained in the air gathering herself to go leaving the golden bowl split into three pieces on the ground she simply referred him to his wife she should see them later they would all meet soon again and meanwhile as to what maggie had meant she said in her turn from the door why maggie herself was doubtless by this time ready to tell him xxxiv left with her husband maggie however for the time said nothing she only felt on the spot a strong sharp wish not to see his face again till he should have had a minute to arrange it she had seen it enough for her temporary clearness and her next movement seen it as it showed during the stare of surprise that followed his entrance then it was that she knew how hugely expert she had been made for judging it quickly by that vision of it indelibly registered for reference that had flashed a light into her troubled soul the night of his late return from matcham the expression worn by it at that juncture for however few instants had given her a sense of its possibilities one of the most relevant of which might have been playing up for her before the consummation of fanny assingham s retreat just long enough to be recognised what she had recognised in it was his recognition the result of his having been forced by the flush of their visitor s attitude and the unextinguished report of her words to take account of the flagrant signs of the accident of the incident on which he had unexpectedly dropped he had not unnaturally failed to see this occurrence represented by the three fragments of an object apparently valuable which lay there on the floor and which even across the width of the room his kept interval reminded him unmistakably though confusedly of something known some other unforgotten image that was a mere shock that was a pain as if fanny s violence had been a violence redoubled and acting beyond its intention a violence calling up the hot blood as a blow across the mouth might have called it maggie knew as she turned away from him that she didn t want his pain what she wanted was her own simple certainty not the red mark of conviction flaming there in his beauty if she could have gone on with bandaged eyes she would have liked that best if it were a question of saying what she now apparently should have to and of taking from him what he would say any blindness that might wrap it would be the nearest approach to a boon she went in silence to where her friend never in intention visibly so much her friend as at that moment had braced herself to so amazing an energy and there under amerigo s eyes she picked up the shining pieces bedizened and jewelled in her rustling finery she paid with humility of attitude this prompt tribute to order only to find however that she could carry but two of the fragments at once she brought them over to the chimney piece to the conspicuous place occupied by the cup before fanny s appropriation of it and after laying them carefully down went back for what remained the solid detached foot with this she returned to the mantel shelf placing it with deliberation in the centre and then for a minute occupying herself as with the attempt to fit the other morsels after she had squared again her little objects on the chimney she was within an ace in fact of turning on him with that appeal besides its being lucid for her all the while that the occasion was passing that they were dining out that he wasn t dressed and that though she herself was she was yet in all probability so horribly red in the face and so awry in many ways with agitation that in view of the ambassador s company of possible comments and constructions she should need before her glass some restoration of appearances amerigo meanwhile after all could clearly make the most of her having enjoined on him to wait suggested it by the positive pomp of her dealings with the smashed cup to wait that is till she should pronounce as mrs assingham had promised for her this delay again certainly tested her presence of mind though that strain was not what presently made her speak keep her eyes for the time from her husband s as she might she soon found herself much more drivingly conscious of the strain on his own wit there was even a minute when her back was turned to him during which she knew once more the strangeness of her desire to spare him a strangeness that had already fifty times brushed her in the depth of her trouble as with the wild wing of some bird of the air who might blindly have swooped for an instant into the shaft of a well darkening there by his momentary flutter the far off round of sky it was extraordinary this quality in the taste of her wrong which made her completed sense of it seem rather to soften than to harden and it was the more extraordinary the more she had to recognise it for what it came to was that seeing herself finally sure knowing everything having the fact in all its abomination so utterly before her that there was nothing else to add what it came to was that merely by being with him there in silence she felt within her the sudden split between conviction and action they had begun to cease on the spot surprisingly to be connected conviction that is budged no inch only planting its feet the more firmly in the soil but action began to hover like some lighter and larger but easier form excited by its very power to keep above ground it would be free it would be independent it would go in wouldn t it for some prodigious and superior adventure of its own what would condemn it so to speak to the responsibility of freedom this glimmered on maggie even now was the possibility richer with every lapsing moment that her husband would have on the whole question a new need of her a need which was in fact being born between them in these very seconds it struck her truly as so new that he would have felt hitherto none to compare with it at all would indeed absolutely by this circumstance be really needing her for the first one in their whole connection no he had used her had even exceedingly enjoyed her before this but there had been no precedent for that character of a proved necessity to him which she was rapidly taking on the immense advantage of this particular clue moreover was that she should have now to arrange alter to falsify nothing should have to be but consistently simple and straight she asked herself with concentration while her back was still presented what would be the very ideal of that method after which the next instant it had all come to her and she had turned round upon him for the application fanny assingham broke it knowing it had a crack and that it would go if she used sufficient force she thought when i had told her that that would be the best thing to do with it thought so from her own point of view that hadn t been at all my idea but she acted before i understood i had on the contrary she explained put it here in full view exactly that you might see he stood with his hands in his pockets he had carried his eyes to the fragments on the chimney piece and she could already distinguish the element of relief absolutely of succour in his acceptance from her of the opportunity to consider the fruits of their friend s violence every added inch of reflection and delay having the advantage from this point on of counting for him double it had operated within her now to the last intensity her glimpse of the precious truth that by her helping him helping him to help himself as it were she should help him to help her hadn t she fairly got into his labyrinth with him wasn t she indeed in the very act of placing herself there for him at its centre and core whence on that definite orientation and by an instinct all her own she might securely guide him out of it she offered him thus assuredly a kind of support that was not to have been imagined in advance and that moreover required ah most truly some close looking at before it could be believed in and pronounced void of treachery yes look look she seemed to see him hear her say even while her sounded words were other look look both at the truth that still survives in that smashed evidence and at the even more remarkable appearance that i m not such a fool as you supposed me look at the possibility that since i am different there may still be something in it for you if you re capable of working with me to get that out consider of course as you must the question of what you may have to surrender on your side what price you may have to pay whom you may have to pay with to set this advantage free but take in at any rate that there is something for you if you don t too blindly spoil your chance for it he went no nearer the damnatory pieces but he eyed them from where he stood with a degree of recognition just visibly less to be dissimulated all of which represented for her a certain traceable process and her uttered words meanwhile were different enough from those he might have inserted between the lines of her already spoken it s the golden bowl you know that you saw at the little antiquario s in bloomsbury so long ago when you went there with charlotte when you spent those hours with her unknown to me a day or two before our marriage it was shown you both but you didn t take it you left it for me and i came upon it extraordinarily through happening to go into the same shop on monday last in walking home in prowling about to pick up some small old thing for father s birthday after my visit to the museum my appointment there with mr crichton of which i told you it was shown me and i was struck with it and took it knowing nothing about it at the time what i now know i ve learned since i learned this afternoon a couple of hours ago receiving from it naturally a great impression so there it is in its three pieces you can handle them don t be afraid if you want to make sure the thing is the thing you and charlotte saw together its having come apart makes an unfortunate difference for its beauty its artistic value but none for anything else its other value is just the same i mean that of its having given me so much of the truth about you i don t therefore so much care what becomes of it now unless perhaps you may yourself when you come to think have some good use for it in that case maggie wound up we can easily take the pieces with us to fawns it was wonderful how she felt by the time she had seen herself through this narrow pass that she had really achieved something that she was emerging a little in fine with the prospect less contracted she had done for him that is what her instinct enjoined had laid a basis not merely momentary on which he could meet her when by the turn of his head he did finally meet her this was the last thing that glimmered out of his look but it came into sight none the less as a perception of his distress and almost as a question of his eyes so that for still another minute before he committed himself there occurred between them a kind of unprecedented moral exchange over which her superior lucidity presided it was not however that when he did commit himself the show was promptly portentous but what in the world has fanny assingham had to do with it she could verily out of all her smothered soreness almost have smiled his question so affected her as giving the whole thing up to her but it left her only to go the straighter she has had to do with it that i immediately sent for her and that she immediately came she was the first person i wanted to see because i knew she would know know more about what i had learned i mean than i could make out for myself i made out as much as i could for myself that i also wanted to have done but it didn t in spite of everything take me very far and she has really been a help not so much as she would like to be not so much as poor dear she just now tried to be yet she has done her very best for you never forget that and has kept me along immeasurably better than i should have been able to come without her she has gained me time and that these three months don t you see has been everything she had said don t you see on purpose and was to feel the next moment that it had acted these three months the prince asked counting from the night you came home so late from matcham counting from the hours you spent with charlotte at gloucester your visit to the cathedral which you won t have forgotten describing to me in so much detail for that was the beginning of my being sure before it i had been sufficiently in doubt sure maggie developed of your having and of your having for a long time had two relations with charlotte he stared a little at sea as he took it up two something in the tone of it gave it a sense or an ambiguity almost foolish leaving maggie to feel as in a flash how such a consequence a foredoomed infelicity partaking of the ridiculous even in one of the cleverest might be of the very essence of the penalty of wrong doing oh you may have had fifty had the same relation with her fifty times it s of the number of kinds of relation with her that i speak a number that doesn t matter really so long as there wasn t only one kind as father and i supposed one kind she went on was there before us we took that fully for granted as you saw and accepted it we never thought of there being another kept out of our sight but after the evening i speak of i knew there was something else as i say i had before that my idea which you never dreamed i had from the moment i speak of it had more to go upon and you became yourselves you and she vaguely yet uneasily conscious of the difference but it s within these last hours that i ve most seen where we are and as i ve been in communication with fanny assingham about my doubts so i wanted to let her know my certainty with the determination of which however you must understand she has had nothing to do she defends you maggie remarked he had given her all his attention and with this impression for her again that he was in essence fairly reaching out to her for time time only time she could sufficiently imagine and to whatever strangeness that he absolutely liked her to talk even at the cost of his losing almost everything else by it it was still for a minute as if he waited for something worse wanted everything that was in her to come out any definite fact anything more precisely nameable so that he too as was his right should know where he was what stirred in him above all while he followed in her face the clear train of her speech must have been the impulse to take up something she put before him that he was yet afraid directly to touch he wanted to make free with it but had to keep his hands off for reasons he had already made out and the discomfort of his privation yearned at her out of his eyes with an announcing gleam of the fever the none too tolerable chill of specific recognition she affected him as speaking more or less for her father as well and his eyes might have been trying to hypnotise her into giving him the answer without his asking the question had he his idea and has he now with you anything more those were the words he had to hold himself from not speaking and that she would as yet certainly do nothing to make easy she felt with her sharpest thrill how he was straitened and tied and with the miserable pity of it her present conscious purpose of keeping him so could none the less perfectly accord to name her father on any such basis of anxiety of compunction would be to do the impossible thing to do neither more nor less than give charlotte away visibly palpably traceably he stood off from this moved back from it as from an open chasm now suddenly perceived but which had been between the two with so much so strangely much else quite uncalculated verily it towered before her this history of their confidence they had built strong and piled high based as it was on such appearances their conviction that thanks to her native complacencies of so many sorts she would always quite to the end and through and through take them as nobly sparing her amerigo was at any rate having the sensation of a particular ugliness to avoid a particular difficulty to count with that practically found him as unprepared as if he had been like his wife an abjectly simple person and she meanwhile however abjectly simple was further discerning for herself that whatever he might have to take from her she being on her side beautifully free he would absolutely not be able for any qualifying purpose to name charlotte either as his father in law s wife mrs verver rose between them there for the time in august and prohibitive form to protect her defend her explain about her was at the least to bring her into the question which would be by the same stroke to bring her husband but this was exactly the door maggie wouldn t open to him on all of which she was the next moment asking herself if thus warned and embarrassed he were not fairly writhing in his pain he writhed on that hypothesis some seconds more for it was not till then that he had chosen between what he could do and what he couldn t you re apparently drawing immense conclusions from very small matters won t you perhaps feel in fairness that you re striking out triumphing or whatever i may call it rather too easily feel it when i perfectly admit that your smashed cup there does come back to me i frankly confess now to the occasion and to having wished not to speak of it to you at the time we took two or three hours together by arrangement it was on the eve of my marriage at the moment you say but that put it on the eve of yours too my dear which was directly the point it was desired to find for you at the eleventh hour some small wedding present a hunt for something worth giving you and yet possible from other points of view as well in which it seemed i could be of use you were naturally not to be told precisely because it was all for you we went forth together and we looked we rummaged about and as i remember we called it we prowled then it was that as i freely recognise we came across that crystal cup which i m bound to say upon my honour i think it rather a pity fanny assingham from whatever good motive should have treated so he had kept his hands in his pockets he turned his eyes again but more complacently now to the ruins of the precious vessel and maggie could feel him exhale into the achieved quietness of his explanation a long deep breath of comparative relief behind everything beneath everything it was somehow a comfort to him at last to be talking with her and he seemed to be proving to himself that he could talk it was at a little shop in bloomsbury i think i could go to the place now the man understood italian i remember he wanted awfully to work off his bowl but i didn t believe in it and we didn t take it maggie had listened with an interest that wore all the expression of candour oh you left it for me but what did you take he looked at her first as if he were trying to remember then as if he might have been trying to forget nothing i think at that place what did you take then at any other what did you get me since that was your aim and end for a wedding gift the prince continued very nobly to bethink himself didn t we get you anything maggie waited a little she had for some time now kept her eyes on him steadily but they wandered at this to the fragments on her chimney yes it comes round after all to your having got me the bowl i myself was to come upon it the other day by so wonderful a chance was to find it in the same place and to have it pressed upon me by the same little man who does as you say understand italian i did believe in it you see must have believed in it somehow instinctively for i took it as soon as i saw it though i didn t know at all then she added what i was taking with it the prince paid her for an instant visibly the deference of trying to imagine what this might have been i agree with you that the coincidence is extraordinary the sort of thing that happens mainly in novels and plays but i don t see you must let me say the importance or the connexion of my having made the purchase where you failed of it she had quickly taken him up but she had with her eyes on him once more another drop into the order of her thoughts to which through whatever he might say she was still adhering it s not my having gone into the place at the end of four years that makes the strangeness of the coincidence for don t such chances as that in london easily occur the strangeness she lucidly said is in what my purchase was to represent to me after i had got it home which value came she explained from the wonder of my having found such a friend such a friend as a wonder assuredly her husband could but take it as the little man in the shop he did for me more than he knew i owe it to him he took an interest in me maggie said and taking that interest he recalled your visit he remembered you and spoke of you to me on which the prince passed the comment of a sceptical smile ah but my dear if extraordinary things come from people s taking an interest in you my life in that case she asked must be very agitated well he liked me i mean very particularly it s only so i can account for my afterwards hearing from him and in fact he gave me that to day she pursued he gave me it frankly as his reason to day the prince inquiringly echoed but she was singularly able it had been marvellously given her she afterwards said to herself to abide for her light for her clue by her own order i inspired him with sympathy there you are but the miracle is that he should have a sympathy to offer that could be of use to me that was really the oddity of my chance the princess proceeded that i should have been moved in my ignorance to go precisely to him he saw her so keep her course that it was as if he could at the best but stand aside to watch her and let her pass he only made a vague demonstration that was like an ineffective gesture i m sorry to say any ill of your friends and the thing was a long time ago besides which there was nothing to make me recur to it but i remember the man s striking me as a decided little beast she gave a slow headshake as if no after consideration not that way were an issue i can only think of him as kind for he had nothing to gain he had in fact only to lose it was what he came to tell me that he had asked me too high a price more than the object was really worth there was a particular reason which he hadn t mentioned and which had made him consider and repent he wrote for leave to see me again wrote in such terms that i saw him here this afternoon here it made the prince look about him downstairs in the little red room while he was waiting he looked at the few photographs that stand about there and recognised two of them though it was so long ago he remembered the visit made him by the lady and the gentleman and that gave him his connexion it gave me mine for he remembered everything and told me everything you see you too had produced your effect only unlike you he had thought of it again he had recurred to it he told me of your having wished to make each other presents but of that s not having come off the lady was greatly taken with the piece i had bought of him but you had your reason against receiving it from her and you had been right he would think that of you more than ever now maggie went on he would see how wisely you had guessed the flaw and how easily the bowl could be broken i had bought it myself you see for a present he knew i was doing that this was what had worked in him especially after the price i had paid her story had dropped an instant she still brought it out in small waves of energy each of which spent its force so that he had an opportunity to speak before this force was renewed but the quaint thing was what he now said and what pray was the price she paused again a little it was high certainly for those fragments i think i feel as i look at them there rather ashamed to say the prince then again looked at them he might have been growing used to the sight but shall you at least get your money back oh i m far from wanting it back i feel so that i m getting its worth with which before he could reply she had a quick transition the great fact about the day we re talking of seems to me to have been quite remarkably that no present was then made me if your undertaking had been for that that was not at least what came of it you received then nothing at all the prince looked vague and grave almost retrospectively concerned nothing but an apology for empty hands and empty pockets which was made me as if it mattered a mite ever so frankly ever so beautifully and touchingly this amerigo heard with interest yet not with confusion ah of course you couldn t have minded distinctly as she went on he was getting the better of the mere awkwardness of his arrest quite as if making out that he need suffer arrest from her now before they should go forth to show themselves in the world together in no greater quantity than an occasion ill chosen at the best for a scene might decently make room for he looked at his watch their engagement all the while remained before him but i don t make out you see what case against me you rest on everything i m telling you why the whole case the case of your having for so long so successfully deceived me the idea of your finding something for me charming as that would have been was what had least to do with your taking a morning together at that moment what had really to do with it said maggie was that you had to you couldn t not from the moment you were again face to face and the reason of that was that there had been so much between you before before i came between you at all her husband had been for these last moments moving about under her eyes but at this as to check any show of impatience he again stood still you ve never been more sacred to me than you were at that hour unless perhaps you ve become so at this one the assurance of his speech she could note quite held up its head in him his eyes met her own so for the declaration that it was as if something cold and momentarily unimaginable breathed upon her from afar off out of his strange consistency she kept her direction still however under that oh the thing i ve known best of all is that you ve never wanted together to offend us you ve wanted quite intensely not to and the precautions you ve had to take for it have been for a long time one of the strongest of my impressions that i think she added is the way i ve best known known he repeated after a moment known known that you were older friends and so much more intimate ones than i had any reason to suppose when we married known there were things that hadn t been told me and that gave their meaning little by little to other things that were before me would they have made a difference in the matter of our marriage the prince presently asked if you had known them she took her time to think i grant you not in the matter of ours and then as he again fixed her with his hard yearning which he couldn t keep down the question is so much bigger than that you see how much what i know makes of it for me that was what acted on him this iteration of her knowledge into the question of the validity of the various bearings of which he couldn t on the spot trust himself to pretend in any high way to go what her claim as she made it represented for him that he couldn t help betraying if only as a consequence of the effect of the word itself her repeated distinct know know on his nerves she was capable of being sorry for his nerves at a time when he should need them for dining out pompously rather responsibly without his heart in it yet she was not to let that prevent her using with all economy so precious a chance for supreme clearness i didn t force this upon you you must recollect and it probably wouldn t have happened for you if you hadn t come in ah said the prince i was liable to come in you know i didn t think you were this evening and why not well she answered you have many liabilities of different sorts with which she recalled what she had said to fanny assingham and then you re so deep it produced in his features in spite of his control of them one of those quick plays of expression the shade of a grimace that testified as nothing else did to his race it s you cara who are deep which after an instant she had accepted from him she could so feel at last that it was true then i shall have need of it all but what would you have done he was by this time asking if i hadn t come in i don t know she had hesitated what would you oh io that isn t the question i depend upon you i go on you would have spoken to morrow i think i would have waited and for what he asked to see what difference it would make for myself my possession at last i mean of real knowledge oh said the prince my only point now at any rate she went on is the difference as i say that it may make for you your knowing was from the moment you did come in all i had in view and she sounded it again he should have it once more your knowing that i ve ceased that you ve ceased with her pause in fact she had fairly made him press her for it why to be as i was not to know it was once more then after a little that he had had to stand receptive yet the singular effect of this was that there was still something of the same sort he was made to want he had another hesitation but at last this odd quantity showed then does any one else know it was as near as he could come to naming her father and she kept him at that distance any one any one i mean but fanny assingham i should have supposed you had had by this time particular means of learning i don t see she said why you ask me then after an instant and only after an instant as she saw he made out what she meant and it gave her all strangely enough the still further light that charlotte for herself knew as little as he had known the vision loomed in this light it fairly glared for the few seconds the vision of the two others alone together at fawns and charlotte as one of them having gropingly to go on always not knowing and not knowing the picture flushed at the same time with all its essential colour that of the so possible identity of her father s motive and principle with her own he was deep as amerigo called it so that no vibration of the still air should reach his daughter just as she had earned that description by making and by for that matter intending still to make her care for his serenity or at any rate for the firm outer shell of his dignity all marvellous enamel her paramount law more strangely even than anything else her husband seemed to speak now but to help her in this i know nothing but what you tell me then i ve told you all i intended find out the rest find it out he waited she stood before him a moment it took that time to go on depth upon depth of her situation as she met his face surged and sank within her but with the effect somehow once more that they rather lifted her than let her drop she had her feet somewhere through it all it was her companion absolutely who was at sea and she kept her feet she pressed them to what was beneath her she went over to the bell beside the chimney and gave a ring that he could but take as a summons for her maid it stopped everything for the present it was an intimation to him to go and dress but she had to insist find out for yourself part fifth xxxv after the little party was again constituted at fawns which had taken for completeness some ten days maggie naturally felt herself still more possessed in spirit of everything that had last happened in london there was a phrase that came back to her from old american years she was having by that idiom the time of her life she knew it by the perpetual throb of this sense of possession which was almost too violent either to recognise or to hide it was as if she had come out that was her most general consciousness out of a dark tunnel a dense wood or even simply a smoky room and had thereby at least for going on the advantage of air in her lungs it was as if she were somehow at last gathering in the fruits of patience she had either been really more patient than she had known at the time or had been so for longer the change brought about by itself as great a difference of view as the shift of an inch in the position of a telescope it was her telescope in fact that had gained in range just as her danger lay in her exposing herself to the observation by the more charmed and therefore the more reckless use of this optical resource not under any provocation to produce it in public was her unremitted rule but the difficulties of duplicity had not shrunk while the need of it had doubled humbugging which she had so practised with her father had been a comparatively simple matter on the basis of mere doubt but the ground to be covered was now greatly larger and she felt not unlike some young woman of the theatre who engaged for a minor part in the play and having mastered her cues with anxious effort should find herself suddenly promoted to leading lady and expected to appear in every act of the five she had made much to her husband that last night of her knowing but it was exactly this quantity she now knew that from the moment she could only dissimulate it added to her responsibility and made of the latter all a mere question of having something precious and precarious in charge there was no one to help her with it not even fanny assingham now this good friend s presence having become inevitably with that climax of their last interview in portland place a severely simplified function she had her use oh yes a thousand times but it could only consist henceforth in her quite conspicuously touching at no point whatever assuredly at least with maggie the matter they had discussed she was there inordinately as a value but as a value only for the clear negation of everything she was their general sign precisely of unimpaired beatitude and she was to live up to that somewhat arduous character poor thing as she might she might privately lapse from it if she must with amerigo or with charlotte only not of course ever so much as for the wink of an eye with the master of the house such lapses would be her own affair which maggie at present could take no thought of she treated her young friend meanwhile it was to be said to no betrayal of such wavering so that from the moment of her alighting at the door with the colonel everything went on between them at concert pitch what had she done that last evening in maggie s room but bring the husband and wife more together than as would seem they had ever been therefore what indiscretion should she not show by attempting to go behind the grand appearance of her success which would be to court a doubt of her beneficent work she knew accordingly nothing but harmony and diffused restlessly nothing but peace an extravagant expressive aggressive peace not incongruous after all with the solid calm of the place a kind of helmetted trident shaking pax britannica the peace it must be added had become as the days elapsed a peace quite generally animated and peopled thanks to that fact of the presence of company in which maggie s ability to preserve an appearance had learned from so far back to find its best resource it was not inconspicuous it was in fact striking that this resource just now seemed to meet in the highest degree every one s need quite as if every one were by the multiplication of human objects in the scene by the creation by the confusion of fictive issues hopeful of escaping somebody else s notice it had reached the point in truth that the collective bosom might have been taken to heave with the knowledge of the descent upon adjacent shores for a short period of mrs rance and the lutches still united and still so divided for conquest the sense of the party showed at least oddly enough as favourable to the fancy of the quaint turn that some near week end might derive from their reappearance this measured for maggie the ground they had all travelled together since that unforgotten afternoon of the none so distant year that determinant september sunday when sitting with her father in the park as in commemoration of the climax both of their old order and of their old danger she had proposed to him that they should call in charlotte call her in as a specialist might be summoned to an invalid s chair wasn t it a sign of something rather portentous their being ready to be beholden as for a diversion to the once despised kitty and dotty that had already had its application in truth to her invocation of the castledeans and several other members again of the historic matcham week made before she left town and made always consistently with an idea since she was never henceforth to approach these people without an idea and since that lurid element of their intercourse grew and grew for her with each occasion the flame with which it burned afresh during these particular days the way it held up the torch to anything to everything that might have occurred as the climax of revels springing from traditions so vivified this by itself justified her private motive and reconsecrated her diplomacy she had already produced by the aid of these people something of the effect she sought that of being good for whatever her companions were good for and of not asking either of them to give up anyone or anything for her sake there was moreover frankly a sharpness of point in it that she enjoyed it gave an accent to the truth she wished to illustrate the truth that the surface of her recent life thick sown with the flower of earnest endeavour with every form of the unruffled and the undoubting suffered no symptom anywhere to peep out it was as if under her pressure neither party could get rid of the complicity as it might be figured of the other as if in a word she saw amerigo and charlotte committed for fear of betrayals on their own side to a kind of wan consistency on the subject of lady castledean s set and this latter group by the same stroke compelled to assist at attestations the extent and bearing of which they rather failed to grasp and which left them indeed in spite of hereditary high spirits a trifle bewildered and even a trifle scared they made none the less at fawns for number for movement for sound they played their parts during a crisis that must have hovered for them in the long passages of the old house after the fashion of the established ghost felt through the dark hours as a constant possibility rather than have menaced them in the form of a daylight bore one of the perceived outsiders who are liable to be met in the drawing room or to be sat next to at dinner if the princess moreover had failed of her occult use for so much of the machinery of diversion she would still have had a sense not other than sympathetic for the advantage now extracted from it by fanny assingham s bruised philosophy this good friend s relation to it was actually the revanche she sufficiently indicated of her obscured lustre at matcham where she had known her way about so much less than most of the others she knew it at fawns through the pathless wild of the right tone positively better than any one maggie could note for her and her revenge had the magnanimity of a brave pointing out of it to every one else a wonderful irresistible conscious almost compassionate patronage here was a house she triumphantly caused it to be noted in which she so bristled with values that some of them might serve by her amused willingness to share for such of the temporarily vague among her fellow guests such of the dimly disconcerted as had lost the key to their own it may have been partly through the effect of this especial strain of community with her old friend that maggie found herself one evening moved to take up again their dropped directness of reference they had remained downstairs together late the other women of the party had filed singly or in couples up the grand staircase on which from the equally grand hall these retreats and advances could always be pleasantly observed the men had apparently taken their way to the smoking room while the princess in possession thus of a rare reach of view had lingered as if to enjoy it then she saw that mrs assingham was remaining a little and as for the appreciation of her enjoyment upon which they stood looking at each other across the cleared prospect until the elder woman only vaguely expressive and tentative now came nearer it was like the act of asking if there were anything she could yet do and that question was answered by her immediately feeling on this closer view as she had felt when presenting herself in portland place after maggie s last sharp summons their understanding was taken up by these new snatched moments where that occasion had left it he has never told her that i know of that i m at last satisfied and then as mrs assingham opened wide eyes i ve been in the dark since we came down not understanding what he has been doing or intending not making out what can have passed between them but within a day or two i ve begun to suspect and this evening for reasons oh too many to tell you i ve been sure since it explains nothing has passed between them that s what has happened it explains the princess repeated with energy it explains it explains she spoke in a manner that her auditor was afterwards to describe to the colonel oddly enough as that of the quietest excitement she had turned back to the chimney place where in honour of a damp day and a chill night the piled logs had turned to flame and sunk to embers and the evident intensity of her vision for the fact she imparted made fanny assingham wait upon her words it explained this striking fact more indeed than her companion though conscious of fairly gaping with good will could swallow at once the princess however as for indulgence and confidence quickly filled up the measure he hasn t let her know that i know and clearly doesn t mean to he has made up his mind he ll say nothing about it therefore as she s quite unable to arrive at the knowledge by herself she has no idea how much i m really in possession she believes said maggie and so far as her own conviction goes she knows that i m not in possession of anything and that somehow for my own help seems to me immense immense my dear mrs assingham applausively murmured though not quite even as yet seeing all the way he s keeping quiet then on purpose on purpose maggie s lighted eyes at least looked further than they had ever looked he ll never tell her now fanny wondered she cast about her most of all she admired her little friend in whom this announcement was evidently animated by an heroic lucidity she stood there in her full uniform like some small erect commander of a siege an anxious captain who has suddenly got news replete with importance for him of agitation of division within the place this importance breathed upon her comrade so you re all right oh all right s a good deal to say but i seem at least to see as i haven t before where i am with it fanny bountifully brooded there was a point left vague and you have it from him your husband himself has told you told me why what you speak of it isn t of an assurance received from him then that you do speak at which maggie had continued to stare dear me no do you suppose i ve asked him for an assurance ah you haven t her companion smiled that s what i supposed you might mean then darling what have you asked him for i ve asked him for nothing but this in turn made fanny stare then nothing that evening of the embassy dinner passed between you on the contrary everything passed everything everything i told him what i knew and i told him how i knew it mrs assingham waited and that was all wasn t it quite enough oh love she bridled that s for you to have judged then i have judged said maggie i did judge i made sure he understood then i let him alone mrs assingham wondered but he didn t explain explain thank god no maggie threw back her head as with horror at the thought then the next moment added and i didn t either the decency of pride in it shed a cold little light yet as from heights at the base of which her companion rather panted but if he neither denies nor confesses he does what s a thousand times better he lets it alone he does maggie went on as he would do as i see now that i was sure he would he lets me alone fanny assingham turned it over then how do you know so where as you say you are why just by that i put him in possession of the difference the difference made about me by the fact that i hadn t been after all though with a wonderful chance i admitted helping me too stupid to have arrived at knowledge he had to see that i m changed for him quite changed from the idea of me that he had so long been going on with it became a question then of his really taking in the change and what i now see is that he is doing so fanny followed as she could which he shows by letting you as you say alone maggie looked at her a minute and by letting her mrs assingham did what she might to embrace it checked a little however by a thought that was the nearest approach she could have in this almost too large air to an inspiration ah but does charlotte let him oh that s another affair with which i ve practically nothing to do i dare say however she doesn t and the princess had a more distant gaze for the image evoked by the question i don t in fact well see how she can but the point for me is that he understands yes fanny assingham cooed understands well what i want i want a happiness without a hole in it big enough for you to poke in your finger a brilliant perfect surface to begin with at least i see the golden bowl as it was to have been and maggie dwelt musingly on this obscured figure the bowl with all our happiness in it the bowl without the crack for mrs assingham too the image had its force and the precious object shone before her again reconstituted plausible presentable but wasn t there still a piece missing yet if he lets you alone and you only let him mayn t our doing so you mean be noticed mayn t it give us away well we hope not we try not we take such care we alone know what s between us we and you and haven t you precisely been struck since you ve been here maggie asked with our making so good a show her friend hesitated to your father but it made her hesitate too she wouldn t speak of her father directly to everyone to her now that you understand it held poor fanny again in wonder to charlotte yes if there s so much beneath it for you and if it s all such a plan that makes it hang together it makes you hang together she fairly exhaled her admiration you re like nobody else you re extraordinary maggie met it with appreciation but with a reserve no i m not extraordinary but i am for every one quiet well that s just what is extraordinary quiet is more than i am and you leave me far behind with which again for an instant mrs assingham frankly brooded now that i understand you say but there s one thing i don t understand and the next minute while her companion waited she had mentioned it how can charlotte after all not have pressed him not have attacked him about it how can she not have asked him asked him on his honour i mean if you know how can she not why of course said the princess limpidly she must well then well then you think he must have told her why exactly what i mean said maggie is that he will have done nothing of the sort will as i say have maintained the contrary fanny assingham weighed it under her direct appeal for the truth under her direct appeal for the truth her appeal to his honour her appeal to his honour that s my point fanny assingham braved it for the truth as from him to her from him to any one mrs assingham s face lighted he ll simply he ll insistently have lied maggie brought it out roundly he ll simply he ll insistently have lied it held again her companion who next however with a single movement throwing herself on her neck overflowed oh if you knew how you help me maggie had liked her to understand so far as this was possible but had not been slow to see afterwards how the possibility was limited when one came to think by mysteries she was not to sound this inability in her was indeed not remarkable inasmuch as the princess herself as we have seen was only now in a position to boast of touching bottom maggie lived inwardly in a consciousness that she could but partly open even to so good a friend and her own visitation of the fuller expanse of which was for that matter still going on they had been duskier still however these recesses of her imagination that no doubt was what might at present be said for them she had looked into them on the eve of her leaving town almost without penetration she had made out in those hours and also of a truth during the days which immediately followed little more than the strangeness of a relation having for its chief mark whether to be prolonged or not the absence of any intimate result of the crisis she had invited her husband to recognise they had dealt with this crisis again face to face very briefly the morning after the scene in her room but with the odd consequence of her having appeared merely to leave it on his hands he had received it from her as he might have received a bunch of keys or a list of commissions attentive to her instructions about them but only putting them for the time very carefully and safely into his pocket the instructions had seemed from day to day to make so little difference for his behaviour that is for his speech or his silence to produce as yet so little of the fruit of action he had taken from her on the spot in a word before going to dress for dinner all she then had to give after which on the morrow he had asked her for more a good deal as if she might have renewed her supply during the night but he had had at his command for this latter purpose an air of extraordinary detachment and discretion an air amounting really to an appeal which if she could have brought herself to describe it vulgarly she would have described as cool just as he himself would have described it in any one else as cheeky a suggestion that she should trust him on the particular ground since she didn t on the general neither his speech nor his silence struck her as signifying more or less under this pressure than they had seemed to signify for weeks past yet if her sense hadn t been absolutely closed to the possibility in him of any thought of wounding her she might have taken his undisturbed manner the perfection of his appearance of having recovered himself for one of those intentions of high impertinence by the aid of which great people les grands seigneurs persons of her husband s class and type always know how to re establish a violated order it was her one purely good fortune that she could feel thus sure impertinence to her at any rate was not among the arts on which he proposed to throw himself for though he had in so almost mystifying a manner replied to nothing denied nothing explained nothing apologised for nothing he had somehow conveyed to her that this was not because of any determination to treat her case as not worth it there had been consideration on both occasions in the way he had listened to her even though at the same time there had been extreme reserve a reserve indeed it was also to be remembered qualified by the fact that on their second and shorter interview in portland place and quite at the end of this passage she had imagined him positively proposing to her a temporary accommodation it had been but the matter of something in the depths of the eyes he finally fixed upon her and she had found in it the more she kept it before her the tacitly offered sketch of a working arrangement leave me my reserve don t question it it s all i have just now don t you see so that if you ll make me the concession of letting me alone with it for as long a time as i require i promise you something or other grown under cover of it even though i don t yet quite make out what as a return for your patience she had turned away from him with some such unspoken words as that in her ear and indeed she had to represent to herself that she had spiritually heard them had to listen to them still again to explain her particular patience in face of his particular failure he hadn t so much as pretended to meet for an instant the question raised by her of her accepted ignorance of the point in time the period before their own marriage from which his intimacy with charlotte dated as an ignorance in which he and charlotte had been personally interested and to the pitch of consummately protecting for years each other s interest as a condition so imposed upon her the fact of its having ceased might have made it on the spot the first article of his defence he had vouchsafed it however nothing better than his longest stare of postponed consideration that tribute he had coldly paid it and maggie might herself have been stupefied truly had she not had something to hold on by at her own present ability even provisional to make terms with a chapter of history into which she could but a week before not have dipped without a mortal chill at the rate at which she was living she was getting used hour by hour to these extensions of view and when she asked herself at fawns to what single observation of her own in london the prince had had an affirmation to oppose she but just failed to focus the small strained wife of the moments in question as some panting dancer of a difficult step who had capered before the footlights of an empty theatre to a spectator lounging in a box her best comprehension of amerigo s success in not committing himself was in her recall meanwhile of the inquiries he had made of her on their only return to the subject and which he had in fact explicitly provoked their return in order to make he had had it over with her again the so distinctly remarkable incident of her interview at home with the little bloomsbury shopman this anecdote for him had not altogether surprisingly required some straighter telling and the prince s attitude in presence of it had represented once more his nearest approach to a cross examination the difficulty in respect to the little man had been for the question of his motive his motive in writing first in the spirit of retraction to a lady with whom he had made a most advantageous bargain and in then coming to see her so that his apology should be personal maggie had felt her explanation weak but there were the facts and she could give no other left alone after the transaction with the knowledge that his visitor designed the object bought of him as a birthday gift to her father for maggie confessed freely to having chattered to him almost as to a friend the vendor of the golden bowl had acted on a scruple rare enough in vendors of any class and almost unprecedented in the thrifty children of israel he hadn t liked what he had done and what he had above all made such a good thing of having done at the thought of his purchaser s good faith and charming presence opposed to that flaw in her acquestion which would make it verily as an offering to a loved parent a thing of sinister meaning and evil effect he had known conscientious he had known superstitious visitings had given way to a whim all the more remarkable to his own commercial mind no doubt from its never having troubled him in other connexions she had recognised the oddity of her adventure and left it to show for what it was she had not been unconscious on the other hand that if it hadn t touched amerigo so nearly he would have found in it matter for some amused reflection he had uttered an extraordinary sound something between a laugh and a howl on her saying as she had made a point of doing oh most certainly he told me his reason was because he liked me though she remained in doubt of whether that inarticulate comment had been provoked most by the familiarities she had offered or by those that so pictured she had had to endure that the partner of her bargain had yearned to see her again that he had plainly jumped at a pretext for it this also she had frankly expressed herself to the prince as having in no snubbing no scandalised but rather in a positively appreciative and indebted spirit not delayed to make out he had wished ever so seriously to return her a part of her money and she had wholly declined to receive it and then he had uttered his hope that she had not at all events already devoted the crystal cup to the beautiful purpose she had so kindly and so fortunately named to him it wasn t a thing for a present to a person she was fond of for she wouldn t wish to give a present that would bring ill luck that had come to him so that he couldn t rest and he should feel better now that he had told her his having led her to act in ignorance was what he should have been ashamed of and if she would pardon gracious lady as she was all the liberties he had taken she might make of the bowl any use in life but that one it was after this that the most extraordinary incident of all of course had occurred his pointing to the two photographs with the remark that those were persons he knew and that more wonderful still he had made acquaintance with them years before precisely over the same article the lady on that occasion had taken up the fancy of presenting it to the gentleman and the gentleman guessing and dodging ever so cleverly had declared that he wouldn t for the world receive an object under such suspicion he himself the little man had confessed wouldn t have minded about them but he had never forgotten either their talk or their faces the impression altogether made by them and if she really wished to know now what had perhaps most moved him it was the thought that she should ignorantly have gone in for a thing not good enough for other buyers he had been immensely struck that was another point with this accident of their turning out after so long friends of hers too they had disappeared and this was the only light he had ever had upon them he had flushed up quite red with his recognition with all his responsibility had declared that the connexion must have had mysteriously something to do with the impulse he had obeyed and maggie had made to her husband while he again stood before her no secret of the shock for herself so suddenly and violently received she had done her best even while taking it full in the face not to give herself away but she wouldn t answer no she wouldn t for what she might in her agitation have made her informant think he might think what he would there had been three or four minutes during which while she asked him question upon question she had doubtless too little cared and he had spoken for his remembrance as fully as she could have wished he had spoken oh delightedly for the terms on which his other visitors had appeared to be with each other and in fact for that conviction of the nature and degree of their intimacy under which in spite of precautions they hadn t been able to help leaving him he had observed and judged and not forgotten he had been sure they were great people but no ah no distinctly hadn t liked them as he liked the signora principessa certainly she had created no vagueness about that he had been in possession of her name and address for sending her both her cup and her account but the others he had only always wondered about he had been sure they would never come back and as to the time of their visit he could place it positively to a day by reason of a transaction of importance recorded in his books that had occurred but a few hours later he had left her in short definitely rejoicing that he had been able to make up to her for not having been quite square over their little business by rendering her so unexpectedly the service of this information his joy moreover was as much as amerigo would a matter of the personal interest with which her kindness gentleness grace her charming presence and easy humanity and familiarity had inspired him all of which while in thought maggie went over it again and again oh over any imputable rashness of her own immediate passion and pain as well as over the rest of the straight little story she had after all to tell might very conceivably make a long sum for the prince to puzzle out there were meanwhile after the castledeans and those invited to meet them had gone and before mrs rance and the lutches had come three or four days during which she was to learn the full extent of her need not to be penetrable and then it was indeed that she felt all the force and threw herself upon all the help of the truth she had confided several nights earlier to fanny assingham she had known it in advance had warned herself of it while the house was full charlotte had designs upon her of a nature best known to herself and was only waiting for the better opportunity of their finding themselves less companioned this consciousness had been exactly at the bottom of maggie s wish to multiply their spectators there were moments for her positively moments of planned postponement of evasion scarcely less disguised than studied during which she turned over with anxiety the different ways there being two or three possible ones in which her young stepmother might at need seek to work upon her amerigo s not having told her of his passage with his wife gave for maggie altogether a new aspect to charlotte s consciousness and condition an aspect with which for apprehension for wonder and even at moments inconsequently enough for something like compassion the princess had now to reckon she asked herself for she was capable of that what he had meant by keeping the sharer of his guilt in the dark about a matter touching her otherwise so nearly what he had meant that is for this unmistakably mystified personage herself maggie could imagine what he had meant for her all sorts of thinkable things whether things of mere form or things of sincerity things of pity or things of prudence he had meant for instance in all probability primarily to conjure away any such appearance of a changed relation between the two women as his father in law might notice and follow up it would have been open to him however given the pitch of their intimacy to avert this danger by some more conceivable course with charlotte since an earnest warning in fact the full freedom of alarm that of his insisting to her on the peril of suspicion incurred and on the importance accordingly of outward peace at any price would have been the course really most conceivable instead of warning and advising he had reassured and deceived her so that our young woman who had been from far back by the habit if her nature as much on her guard against sacrificing others as if she felt the great trap of life mainly to be set for one s doing so now found herself attaching her fancy to that side of the situation of the exposed pair which involved for themselves at least the sacrifice of the least fortunate she never at present thought of what amerigo might be intending without the reflection by the same stroke that whatever this quantity he was leaving still more to her own ingenuity he was helping her when the thing came to the test only by the polished possibly almost too polished surface his manner to his wife wore for an admiring world and that surely was entitled to scarcely more than the praise of negative diplomacy he was keeping his manner right as she had related to mrs assingham the case would have been beyond calculation truly if on top of everything he had allowed it to go wrong she had hours of exaltation indeed when the meaning of all this pressed in upon her as a tacit vow from him to abide without question by whatever she should be able to achieve or think fit to prescribe then it was that even while holding her breath for the awe of it she truly felt almost able enough for anything it was as if she had passed in a time incredibly short from being nothing for him to being all it was as if rightly noted every turn of his head every tone of his voice in these days might mean that there was but one way in which a proud man reduced to abjection could hold himself during those of maggie s vigils in which that view loomed largest the image of her husband that it thus presented to her gave out a beauty for the revelation of which she struck herself as paying if anything all too little to make sure of it to make sure of the beauty shining out of the humility and of the humility lurking in all the pride of his presence she would have gone the length of paying more yet of paying with difficulties and anxieties compared to which those actually before her might have been as superficial as headaches or rainy days the point at which these exaltations dropped however was the point at which it was apt to come over her that if her complications had been greater the question of paying would have been limited still less to the liabilities of her own pocket the complications were verily great enough whether for ingenuities or sublimities so long as she had to come back to it so often that charlotte all the while could only be struggling with secrets sharper than her own it was odd how that certainty again and again determined and coloured her wonderments of detail the question for instance of how amerigo in snatched opportunities of conference put the haunted creature off with false explanations met her particular challenges and evaded if that was what he did do her particular demands even the conviction that charlotte was but awaiting some chance really to test her trouble upon her lover s wife left maggie s sense meanwhile open as to the sight of gilt wires and bruised wings the spacious but suspended cage the home of eternal unrest of pacings beatings shakings all so vain into which the baffled consciousness helplessly resolved itself the cage was the deluded condition and maggie as having known delusion rather understood the nature of cages she walked round charlotte s cautiously and in a very wide circle and when inevitably they had to communicate she felt herself comparatively outside on the breast of nature and saw her companion s face as that of a prisoner looking through bars so it was that through bars bars richly gilt but firmly though discreetly planted charlotte finally struck her as making a grim attempt from which at first the princess drew back as instinctively as if the door of the cage had suddenly been opened from within xxxvi they had been alone that evening alone as a party of six and four of them after dinner under suggestion not to be resisted sat down to bridge in the smoking room they had passed together to that apartment on rising from table charlotte and mrs assingham alike indulgent always to tobacco and in fact practising an emulation which as fanny said would for herself had the colonel not issued an interdict based on the fear of her stealing his cigars have stopped only at the short pipe here cards had with inevitable promptness asserted their rule the game forming itself as had often happened before of mr verver with mrs assingham for partner and of the prince with mrs verver the colonel who had then asked of maggie license to relieve his mind of a couple of letters for the earliest post out on the morrow was addressing himself to this task at the other end of the room and the princess herself had welcomed the comparatively hushed hour for the bridge players were serious and silent much in the mood of a tired actress who has the good fortune to be off while her mates are on almost long enough for a nap on the property sofa in the wing maggie s nap had she been able to snatch forty winks would have been of the spirit rather than of the sense yet as she subsided near a lamp with the last salmon coloured french periodical she was to fail for refreshment even of that sip of independence there was no question for her as she found of closing her eyes and getting away they strayed back to life in the stillness over the top of her review she could lend herself to none of those refinements of the higher criticism with which its pages bristled she was there where her companions were there again and more than ever there it was as if of a sudden they had been made in their personal intensity and their rare complexity of relation freshly importunate to her it was the first evening there had been no one else mrs rance and the lutches were due the next day but meanwhile the facts of the situation were upright for her round the green cloth and the silver flambeaux the fact of her father s wife s lover facing his mistress the fact of her father sitting all unsounded and unblinking between them the fact of charlotte keeping it up keeping up everything across the table with her husband beside her the fact of fanny assingham wonderful creature placed opposite to the three and knowing more about each probably when one came to think than either of them knew of either erect above all for her was the sharp edged fact of the relation of the whole group individually and collectively to herself herself so speciously eliminated for the hour but presumably more present to the attention of each than the next card to be played yes under that imputation to her sense they sat the imputation of wondering beneath and behind all their apparently straight play if she weren t really watching them from her corner and consciously as might be said holding them in her hand she was asking herself at last how they could bear it for though cards were as nought to her and she could follow no move so that she was always on such occasions out of the party they struck her as conforming alike in the matter of gravity and propriety to the stiff standard of the house her father she knew was a high adept one of the greatest she had been ever in her stupidity his small his sole despair amerigo excelled easily as he understood and practised every art that could beguile large leisure mrs assingham and charlotte moreover were accounted as good as members of a sex incapable of the nobler consistency could be therefore evidently they were not all so up to their usual form merely passing it off whether for her or for themselves and the amount of enjoyed or at least achieved security represented by so complete a conquest of appearances was what acted on her nerves precisely with a kind of provocative force she found herself for five minutes thrilling with the idea of the prodigious effect that just as she sat there near them she had at her command with the sense that if she were but different oh ever so different all this high decorum would hang by a hair there reigned for her absolutely during these vertiginous moments that fascination of the monstrous that temptation of the horribly possible which we so often trace by its breaking out suddenly lest it should go further in unexplained retreats and reactions after it had been thus vividly before her for a little that springing up under her wrong and making them all start stare and turn pale she might sound out their doom in a single sentence a sentence easy to choose among several of the lurid after she had faced that blinding light and felt it turn to blackness she rose from her place laying aside her magazine and moved slowly round the room passing near the card players and pausing an instant behind the chairs in turn silent and discreet she bent a vague mild face upon them as if to signify that little as she followed their doings she wished them well and she took from each across the table in the common solemnity an upward recognition which she was to carry away with her on her moving out to the terrace a few minutes later her father and her husband mrs assingham and charlotte had done nothing but meet her eyes yet the difference in these demonstrations made each a separate passage which was all the more wonderful since with the secret behind every face they had alike tried to look at her through it and in denial of it it all left her as she wandered off with the strangest of impressions the sense forced upon her as never yet of an appeal a positive confidence from the four pairs of eyes that was deeper than any negation and that seemed to speak on the part of each of some relation to be contrived by her a relation with herself which would spare the individual the danger the actual present strain of the relation with the others they thus tacitly put it upon her to be disposed of the whole complexity of their peril and she promptly saw why because she was there and there just as she was to lift it off them and take it to charge herself with it as the scapegoat of old of whom she had once seen a terrible picture had been charged with the sins of the people and had gone forth into the desert to sink under his burden and die that indeed wasn t their design and their interest that she should sink under hers it wouldn t be their feeling that she should do anything but live live on somehow for their benefit and even as much as possible in their company to keep proving to them that they had truly escaped and that she was still there to simplify this idea of her simplifying and of their combined struggle dim as yet but steadily growing toward the perception of her adopting it from them clung to her while she hovered on the terrace where the summer night was so soft that she scarce needed the light shawl she had picked up several of the long windows of the occupied rooms stood open to it and the light came out in vague shafts and fell upon the old smooth stones the hour was moonless and starless and the air heavy and still which was why in her evening dress she need fear no chill and could get away in the outer darkness from that provocation of opportunity which had assaulted her within on her sofa as a beast might have leaped at her throat nothing in fact was stranger than the way in which when she had remained there a little her companions watched by her through one of the windows actually struck her as almost consciously and gratefully safer they might have been really charming as they showed in the beautiful room and charlotte certainly as always magnificently handsome and supremely distinguished they might have been figures rehearsing some play of which she herself was the author they might even for the happy appearance they continued to present have been such figures as would by the strong note of character in each fill any author with the certitude of success especially of their own histrionic they might in short have represented any mystery they would the point being predominantly that the key to the mystery the key that could wind and unwind it without a snap of the spring was there in her pocket or rather no doubt clasped at this crisis in her hand and pressed as she walked back and forth to her breast she walked to the end and far out of the light she returned and saw the others still where she had left them she passed round the house and looked into the drawing room lighted also but empty now and seeming to speak the more in its own voice of all the possibilities she controlled spacious and splendid like a stage again awaiting a drama it was a scene she might people by the press of her spring either with serenities and dignities and decencies or with terrors and shames and ruins things as ugly as those formless fragments of her golden bowl she was trying so hard to pick up she continued to walk and continued to pause she stopped afresh for the look into the smoking room and by this time it was as if the recognition had of itself arrested her she saw as in a picture with the temptation she had fled from quite extinct why it was she had been able to give herself so little from the first to the vulgar heat of her wrong she might fairly as she watched them have missed it as a lost thing have yearned for it for the straight vindictive view the rights of resentment the rages of jealousy the protests of passion as for something she had been cheated of not least a range of feelings which for many women would have meant so much but which for her husband s wife for her father s daughter figured nothing nearer to experience than a wild eastern caravan looming into view with crude colours in the sun fierce pipes in the air high spears against the sky all a thrill a natural joy to mingle with but turning off short before it reached her and plunging into other defiles she saw at all events why horror itself had almost failed her the horror that foreshadowed in advance would by her thought have made everything that was unaccustomed in her cry out with pain the horror of finding evil seated all at its ease where she had only dreamed of good the horror of the thing hideously behind behind so much trusted so much pretended nobleness cleverness tenderness it was the first sharp falsity she had known in her life to touch at all or be touched by it had met her like some bad faced stranger surprised in one of the thick carpeted corridors of a house of quiet on a sunday afternoon and yet yes amazingly she had been able to look at terror and disgust only to know that she must put away from her the bitter sweet of their freshness the sight from the window of the group so constituted told her why told her how named to her as with hard lips named straight at her so that she must take it full in the face that other possible relation to the whole fact which alone would bear upon her irresistibly it was extraordinary they positively brought home to her that to feel about them in any of the immediate inevitable assuaging ways the ways usually open to innocence outraged and generosity betrayed would have been to give them up and that giving them up was marvellously not to be thought of she had never from the first hour of her state of acquired conviction given them up so little as now though she was no doubt as the consequence of a step taken a few minutes later to invoke the conception of doing that if might be even less she had resumed her walk stopping here and there while she rested on the cool smooth stone balustrade to draw it out in the course of which after a little she passed again the lights of the empty drawing room and paused again for what she saw and felt there it was not at once however that this became quite concrete that was the effect of her presently making out that charlotte was in the room launched and erect there in the middle and looking about her that she had evidently just come round to it from her card table by one of the passages with the expectation to all appearance of joining her stepdaughter she had pulled up at seeing the great room empty maggie not having passed out on leaving the group in a manner to be observed so definite a quest of her with the bridge party interrupted or altered for it was an impression that fairly assailed the princess and to which something of attitude and aspect of the air of arrested pursuit and purpose in charlotte together with the suggestion of her next vague movements quickly added its meaning this meaning was that she had decided that she had been infinitely conscious of maggie s presence before that she knew that she would at last find her alone and that she wanted her for some reason enough to have presumably called on bob assingham for aid he had taken her chair and let her go and the arrangement was for maggie a signal proof of her earnestness of the energy in fact that though superficially commonplace in a situation in which people weren t supposed to be watching each other was what affected our young woman on the spot as a breaking of bars the splendid shining supple creature was out of the cage was at large and the question now almost grotesquely rose of whether she mightn t by some art just where she was and before she could go further be hemmed in and secured it would have been for a moment in this case a matter of quickly closing the windows and giving the alarm with poor maggie s sense that though she couldn t know what she wanted of her it was enough for trepidation that at these firm hands anything should be to say nothing of the sequel of a flight taken again along the terrace even under the shame of the confessed feebleness of such evasions on the part of an outraged wife it was to this feebleness none the less that the outraged wife had presently resorted the most that could be said for her being as she felt while she finally stopped short at a distance that she could at any rate resist her abjection sufficiently not to sneak into the house by another way and safely reach her room she had literally caught herself in the act of dodging and ducking and it told her there vividly in a single word what she had all along been most afraid of she had been afraid of the particular passage with charlotte that would determine her father s wife to take him into her confidence as she couldn t possibly as yet have done to prepare for him a statement of her wrong to lay before him the infamy of what she was apparently suspected of this should she have made up her mind to do it would rest on a calculation the thought of which evoked strangely other possibilities and visions it would show her as sufficiently believing in her grasp of her husband to be able to assure herself that with his daughter thrown on the defensive with maggie s cause and maggie s word in fine against her own it wasn t maggie s that would most certainly carry the day such a glimpse of her conceivable idea which would be founded on reasons all her own reasons of experience and assurance impenetrable to others but intimately familiar to herself such a glimpse opened out wide as soon as it had come into view for if so much as this was still firm ground between the elder pair if the beauty of appearances had been so consistently preserved it was only the golden bowl as maggie herself knew it that had been broken the breakage stood not for any wrought discomposure among the triumphant three it stood merely for the dire deformity of her attitude toward them she was unable at the minute of course fully to measure the difference thus involved for her and it remained inevitably an agitating image the way it might be held over her that if she didn t of her own prudence satisfy charlotte as to the reference in her mocking spirit of so much of the unuttered and unutterable of the constantly and unmistakably implied her father would be invited without further ceremony to recommend her to do so but any confidence any latent operating insolence that mrs verver should thanks to her large native resources continue to be possessed of and to hold in reserve glimmered suddenly as a possible working light and seemed to offer for meeting her a new basis and something like a new system maggie felt truly a rare contraction of the heart on making out the next instant what the new system would probably have to be and she had practically done that before perceiving that the thing she feared had already taken place charlotte extending her search appeared now to define herself vaguely in the distance of this after an instant the princess was sure though the darkness was thick for the projected clearness of the smoking room windows had presently contributed its help her friend came slowly into that circle having also for herself by this time not indistinguishably discovered that maggie was on the terrace maggie from the end saw her stop before one of the windows to look at the group within and then saw her come nearer and pause again still with a considerable length of the place between them yes charlotte had seen she was watching her from afar and had stopped now to put her further attention to the test her face was fixed on her through the night she was the creature who had escaped by force from her cage yet there was in her whole motion assuredly even as so dimly discerned a kind of portentous intelligent stillness she had escaped with an intention but with an intention the more definite that it could so accord with quiet measures the two women at all events only hovered there for these first minutes face to face over their interval and exchanging no sign the intensity of their mutual look might have pierced the night and maggie was at last to start with the scared sense of having thus yielded to doubt to dread to hesitation for a time that with no other proof needed would have completely given her away how long had she stood staring a single minute or five long enough in any case to have felt herself absolutely take from her visitor something that the latter threw upon her irresistibly by this effect of silence by this effect of waiting and watching by this effect unmistakably of timing her indecision and her fear if then scared and hanging back she had as was so evident sacrificed all past pretences it would have been with the instant knowledge of an immense advantage gained that charlotte finally saw her come on maggie came on with her heart in her hands she came on with the definite prevision throbbing like the tick of a watch of a doom impossibly sharp and hard but to which after looking at it with her eyes wide open she had none the less bowed her head by the time she was at her companion s side for that matter by the time charlotte had without a motion without a word simply let her approach and stand there her head was already on the block so that the consciousness that everything had now gone blurred all perception of whether or no the axe had fallen oh the advantage it was perfectly enough in truth with mrs verver for what was maggie s own sense but that of having been thrown over on her back with her neck from the first half broken and her helpless face staring up that position only could account for the positive grimace of weakness and pain produced there by charlotte s dignity i ve come to join you i thought you would be here oh yes i m here maggie heard herself return a little flatly it s too close in doors very but close even here charlotte was still and grave she had even uttered her remark about the temperature with an expressive weight that verged upon solemnity so that maggie reduced to looking vaguely about at the sky could only feel her not fail of her purpose the air s heavy as if with thunder i think there ll be a storm she made the suggestion to carry off an awkwardness which was a part always of her companion s gain but the awkwardness didn t diminish in the silence that followed charlotte had said nothing in reply her brow was dark as with a fixed expression and her high elegance her handsome head and long straight neck testified through the dusk to their inveterate completeness and noble erectness it was as if what she had come out to do had already begun and when as a consequence maggie had said helplessly don t you want something won t you have my shawl everything might have crumbled away in the comparative poverty of the tribute mrs verver s rejection of it had the brevity of a sign that they hadn t closed in for idle words just as her dim serious face uninterruptedly presented until they moved again might have represented the success with which she watched all her message penetrate they presently went back the way she had come but she stopped maggie again within range of the smoking room window and made her stand where the party at cards would be before her side by side for three minutes they fixed this picture of quiet harmonies the positive charm of it and as might have been said the full significance which as was now brought home to maggie could be no more after all than a matter of interpretation differing always for a different interpreter as she herself had hovered in sight of it a quarter of an hour before it would have been a thing for her to show charlotte to show in righteous irony in reproach too stern for anything but silence but now it was she who was being shown it and shown it by charlotte and she saw quickly enough that as charlotte showed it so she must at present submissively seem to take it the others were absorbed and unconscious either silent over their game or dropping remarks unheard on the terrace and it was to her father s quiet face discernibly expressive of nothing that was in his daughter s mind that our young woman s attention was most directly given his wife and his daughter were both closely watching him and to which of them could he have been notified of this would his raised eyes first all impulsively have responded in which of them would he have felt it most important to destroy for his clutch at the equilibrium any germ of uneasiness not yet since his marriage had maggie so sharply and so formidably known her old possession of him as a thing divided and contested she was looking at him by charlotte s leave and under charlotte s direction quite in fact as if the particular way she should look at him were prescribed to her quite even as if she had been defied to look at him in any other it came home to her too that the challenge wasn t as might be said in his interest and for his protection but pressingly insistently in charlotte s for that of her security at any price she might verily by this dumb demonstration have been naming to maggie the price naming it as a question for maggie herself a sum of money that she properly was to find she must remain safe and maggie must pay what she was to pay with being her own affair straighter than ever thus the princess again felt it all put upon her and there was a minute just a supreme instant during which there burned in her a wild wish that her father would only look up it throbbed for these seconds as a yearning appeal to him she would chance it that is if he would but just raise his eyes and catch them across the larger space standing in the outer dark together then he might be affected by the sight taking them as they were he might make some sign she scarce knew what that would save her save her from being the one this way to pay all he might somehow show a preference distinguishing between them might out of pity for her signal to her that this extremity of her effort for him was more than he asked that represented maggie s one little lapse from consistency the sole small deflection in the whole course of her scheme it had come to nothing the next minute for the dear man s eyes had never moved and charlotte s hand promptly passed into her arm had already had very firmly drawn her on quite for that matter as from some sudden some equal perception on her part too of the more ways than one in which their impression could appeal they retraced their steps along the rest of the terrace turning the corner of the house and presently came abreast of the other windows those of the pompous drawing room still lighted and still empty here charlotte again paused and it was again as if she were pointing out what maggie had observed for herself the very look the place had of being vivid in its stillness of having with all its great objects as ordered and balanced as for a formal reception been appointed for some high transaction some real affair of state in presence of this opportunity she faced her companion once more she traced in her the effect of everything she had already communicated she signified with the same success that the terrace and the sullen night would bear too meagre witness to the completion of her idea soon enough then within the room under the old lustres of venice and the eyes of the several great portraits more or less contemporary with these that awaited on the walls of fawns their final far migration soon enough maggie found herself staring and at first all too gaspingly at the grand total to which each separate demand mrs verver had hitherto made upon her however she had made it now amounted i ve been wanting and longer than you d perhaps believe to put a question to you for which no opportunity has seemed to me yet quite so good as this it would have been easier perhaps if you had struck me as in the least disposed ever to give me one i have to take it now you see as i find it they stood in the centre of the immense room and maggie could feel that the scene of life her imagination had made of it twenty minutes before was by this time sufficiently peopled these few straight words filled it to its uttermost reaches and nothing was now absent from her consciousness either of the part she was called upon to play in it charlotte had marched straight in dragging her rich train she rose there beautiful and free with her whole aspect and action attuned to the firmness of her speech maggie had kept the shawl she had taken out with her and clutching it tight in her nervousness drew it round her as if huddling in it for shelter covering herself with it for humility she looked out as from under an improvised hood the sole headgear of some poor woman at somebody s proud door she waited even like the poor woman she met her friend s eyes with recognitions she couldn t suppress she might sound it as she could what question then everything in her from head to foot crowded it upon charlotte that she knew she knew too well that she was showing so that successful vagueness to save some scrap of her dignity from the imminence of her defeat was already a lost cause and the one thing left was if possible at any cost even that of stupid inconsequence to try to look as if she weren t afraid if she could but appear at all not afraid she might appear a little not ashamed that is not ashamed to be afraid which was the kind of shame that could be fastened on her it being fear all the while that moved her her challenge at any rate her wonder her terror the blank blurred surface whatever it was that she presented became a mixture that ceased to signify for to the accumulated advantage by which charlotte was at present sustained her next words themselves had little to add have you any ground of complaint of me is there any wrong you consider i ve done you i feel at last that i ve a right to ask you their eyes had to meet on it and to meet long maggie s avoided at least the disgrace of looking away what makes you want to ask it my natural desire to know you ve done that for so long little justice maggie waited a moment for so long you mean you ve thought i mean my dear that i ve seen i ve seen week after week that you seemed to be thinking of something that perplexed or worried you is it anything for which i m in any degree responsible maggie summoned all her powers what in the world should it be ah that s not for me to imagine and i should be very sorry to have to try to say i m aware of no point whatever at which i may have failed you said charlotte nor of any at which i may have failed any one in whom i can suppose you sufficiently interested to care if i ve been guilty of some fault i ve committed it all unconsciously and am only anxious to hear from you honestly about it but if i ve been mistaken as to what i speak of the difference more and more marked as i ve thought in all your manner to me why obviously so much the better no form of correction received from you could give me greater satisfaction she spoke it struck her companion with rising with extraordinary ease as if hearing herself say it all besides seeing the way it was listened to helped her from point to point she saw she was right that this was the tone for her to take and the thing for her to do the thing as to which she was probably feeling that she had in advance in her delays and uncertainties much exaggerated the difficulty the difficulty was small and it grew smaller as her adversary continued to shrink she was not only doing as she wanted but had by this time effectively done it and hung it up all of which but deepened maggie s sense of the sharp and simple need now of seeing her through to the end if you ve been mistaken you say and the princess but barely faltered you have been mistaken charlotte looked at her splendidly hard you re perfectly sure it s all my mistake all i can say is that you ve received a false impression ah then so much the better from the moment i had received it i knew i must sooner or later speak of it for that you see is systematically my way and now charlotte added you make me glad i ve spoken i thank you very much it was strange how for maggie too with this the difficulty seemed to sink her companion s acceptance of her denial was like a general pledge not to keep things any worse for her than they essentially had to be it positively helped her to build up her falsehood to which accordingly she contributed another block i ve affected you evidently quite accidentally in some way of which i ve been all unaware i ve not felt at any time that you ve wronged me how could i come within a mile charlotte inquired of such a possibility maggie with her eyes on her more easily now made no attempt to say she said after a little something more to the present point i accuse you i accuse you of nothing ah that s lucky charlotte had brought this out with the richness almost of gaiety and maggie to go on had to think with her own intensity of amerigo to think how he on his side had had to go through with his lie to her how it was for his wife he had done so and how his doing so had given her the clue and set her the example he must have had his own difficulty about it and she was not after all falling below him it was in fact as if thanks to her hovering image of him confronted with this admirable creature even as she was confronted there glowed upon her from afar yet straight and strong a deep explanatory light which covered the last inch of the ground he had given her something to conform to and she hadn t unintelligently turned on him gone back on him as he would have said by not conforming they were together thus he and she close close together whereas charlotte though rising there radiantly before her was really off in some darkness of space that would steep her in solitude and harass her with care the heart of the princess swelled accordingly even in her abasement she had kept in tune with the right and something certainly something that might be like a rare flower snatched from an impossible ledge would and possibly soon come of it for her the right the right yes it took this extraordinary form of her humbugging as she had called it to the end it was only a question of not by a hair s breadth deflecting into the truth so supremely was she braced you must take it from me that your anxiety rests quite on a misconception you must take it from me that i ve never at any moment fancied i could suffer by you and marvellously she kept it up not only kept it up but improved on it you must take it from me that i ve never thought of you but as beautiful wonderful and good which is all i think that you can possibly ask charlotte held her a moment longer she needed not then to have appeared only tactless the last word it s much more my dear than i dreamed of asking i only wanted your denial well then you have it upon your honour upon my honour and she made a point even our young woman of not turning away her grip of her shawl had loosened she had let it fall behind her but she stood there for anything more and till the weight should be lifted with which she saw soon enough what more was to come she saw it in charlotte s face and felt it make between them in the air a chill that completed the coldness of their conscious perjury will you kiss me on it then she couldn t say yes but she didn t say no what availed her still however was to measure in her passivity how much too far charlotte had come to retreat but there was something different also something for which while her cheek received the prodigious kiss she had her opportunity the sight of the others who having risen from their cards to join the absent members of their party had reached the open door at the end of the room and stopped short evidently in presence of the demonstration that awaited them her husband and her father were in front and charlotte s embrace of her which wasn t to be distinguished for them either she felt from her embrace of charlotte took on with their arrival a high publicity xxxvii her father had asked her three days later in an interval of calm how she was affected in the light of their reappearance and of their now perhaps richer fruition by dotty and kitty and by the once formidable mrs rance and the consequence of this inquiry had been for the pair just such another stroll together away from the rest of the party and off into the park as had asserted its need to them on the occasion of the previous visit of these anciently more agitating friends that of their long talk on a sequestered bench beneath one of the great trees when the particular question had come up for them the then purblind discussion of which at their enjoyed leisure maggie had formed the habit of regarding as the first beginning of their present situation the whirligig of time had thus brought round for them again on their finding themselves face to face while the others were gathering for tea on the terrace the same odd impulse quietly to slope so adam verver himself as they went familiarly expressed it that had acted in its way of old acted for the distant autumn afternoon and for the sharpness of their since so outlived crisis it might have been funny to them now that the presence of mrs rance and the lutches and with symptoms too at that time less developed had once for their anxiety and their prudence constituted a crisis it might have been funny that these ladies could ever have figured to their imagination as a symbol of dangers vivid enough to precipitate the need of a remedy this amount of entertainment and assistance they were indeed disposed to extract from their actual impressions they had been finding it for months past by maggie s view a resource and a relief to talk with an approach to intensity when they met of all the people they weren t really thinking of and didn t really care about the people with whom their existence had begun almost to swarm and they closed in at present round the spectres of their past as they permitted themselves to describe the three ladies with a better imitation of enjoying their theme than they had been able to achieve certainly during the stay for instance of the castledeans the castledeans were a new joke comparatively and they had had always to maggie s view to teach themselves the way of it whereas the detroit the providence party rebounding so from providence from detroit was an old and ample one of which the most could be made and as to which a humorous insistence could be guarded sharp and sudden moreover this afternoon had been their well nigh confessed desire just to rest together a little as from some strain long felt but never named to rest as who should say shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand each pair of eyes so yearningly and indeed what could it be but so wearily closed as to render the collapse safe from detection by the other pair it was positively as if in short the inward felicity of their being once more perhaps only for half an hour simply daughter and father had glimmered out for them and they had picked up the pretext that would make it easiest they were husband and wife oh so immensely as regards other persons but after they had dropped again on their old bench conscious that the party on the terrace augmented as in the past by neighbours would do beautifully without them it was wonderfully like their having got together into some boat and paddled off from the shore where husbands and wives luxuriant complications made the air too tropical in the boat they were father and daughter and poor dotty and kitty supplied abundantly for their situation the oars or the sail why into the bargain for that matter this came to maggie couldn t they always live so far as they lived together in a boat she felt in her face with the question the breath of a possibility that soothed her they needed only know each other henceforth in the unmarried relation that other sweet evening in the same place he had been as unmarried as possible which had kept down so to speak the quantity of change in their state well then that other sweet evening was what the present sweet evening would resemble with the quite calculable effect of an exquisite inward refreshment they had after all whatever happened always and ever each other each other that was the hidden treasure and the saving truth to do exactly what they would with a provision full of possibilities who could tell as yet what thanks to it they wouldn t have done before the end they had meanwhile been tracing together in the golden air that toward six o clock of a july afternoon hung about the massed kentish woods several features of the social evolution of her old playmates still beckoned on it would seem by unattainable ideals still falling back beyond the sea to their native seats for renewals of the moral financial conversational one scarce knew what to call it outfit and again and for ever reappearing like a tribe of wandering jewesses our couple had finally exhausted however the study of these annals and maggie was to take up after a drop a different matter or one at least with which the immediate connection was not at first apparent were you amused at me just now when i wondered what other people could wish to struggle for did you think me she asked with some earnestness well fatuous fatuous he seemed at a loss i mean sublime in our happiness as if looking down from a height or rather sublime in our general position that s what i mean she spoke as from the habit of her anxious conscience something that disposed her frequently to assure herself for her human commerce of the state of the books of the spirit because i don t at all want she explained to be blinded or made sniffy by any sense of a social situation her father listened to this declaration as if the precautions of her general mercy could still as they betrayed themselves have surprises for him to say nothing of a charm of delicacy and beauty he might have been wishing to see how far she could go and where she would all touchingly to him arrive but she waited a little as if made nervous precisely by feeling him depend too much on what she said they were avoiding the serious standing off anxiously from the real and they fell again and again as if to disguise their precaution itself into the tone of the time that came back to them from their other talk when they had shared together this same refuge don t you remember she went on how when they were here before i broke it to you that i wasn t so very sure we ourselves had the thing itself he did his best to do so had you mean a social situation yes after fanny assingham had first broken it to me that at the rate we were going we should never have one which was what put us on charlotte oh yes they had had it over quite often enough for him easily to remember maggie had another pause taking it from him that he now could both affirm and admit without wincing that they had been at their critical moment put on charlotte it was as if this recognition had been threshed out between them as fundamental to the honest view of their success well she continued i recall how i felt about kitty and dotty that even if we had already then been more placed or whatever you may call what we are now it still wouldn t have been an excuse for wondering why others couldn t obligingly leave me more exalted by having themselves smaller ideas for those she said were the feelings we used to have oh yes he responded philosophically i remember the feelings we used to have maggie appeared to wish to plead for them a little in tender retrospect as if they had been also respectable it was bad enough i thought to have no sympathy in your heart when you had a position but it was worse to be sublime about it as i was so afraid as i m in fact still afraid of being when it wasn t even there to support one and she put forth again the earnestness she might have been taking herself as having outlived became for it which was doubtless too often even now her danger almost sententious one must always whether or no have some imagination of the states of others of what they may feel deprived of however she added kitty and dotty couldn t imagine we were deprived of anything and now and now but she stopped as for indulgence to their wonder and envy and now they see still more that we can have got everything and kept everything and yet not be proud no we re not proud she answered after a moment i m not sure that we re quite proud enough yet she changed the next instant that subject too she could only do so however by harking back as if it had been a fascination she might have been wishing under this renewed this still more suggestive visitation to keep him with her for remounting the stream of time and dipping again for the softness of the water into the contracted basin of the past we talked about it we talked about it you don t remember so well as i you too didn t know and it was beautiful of you like kitty and dotty you too thought we had a position and were surprised when i thought we ought to have told them we weren t doing for them what they supposed in fact maggie pursued we re not doing it now we re not you see really introducing them i mean not to the people they want then what do you call the people with whom they re now having tea it made her quite spring round that s just what you asked me the other time one of the days there was somebody and i told you i didn t call anybody anything i remember that such people the people we made so welcome didn t count that fanny assingham knew they didn t she had awakened his daughter the echo and on the bench there as before he nodded his head amusedly he kept nervously shaking his foot yes they were only good enough the people who came for us i remember he said again that was the way it all happened that was the way that was the way and you asked me maggie added if i didn t think we ought to tell them tell mrs rance in particular i mean that we had been entertaining her up to then under false pretences precisely but you said she wouldn t have understood to which you replied that in that case you were like her you didn t understand no no but i remember how about our having in our benighted innocence no position you quite crushed me with your explanation well then said maggie with every appearance of delight i ll crush you again i told you that you by yourself had one there was no doubt of that you were different from me you had the same one you always had and then i asked you her father concurred why in that case you hadn t the same then indeed you did he had brought her face round to him before and this held it covering him with its kindled brightness the result of the attested truth of their being able thus in talk to live again together what i replied was that i had lost my position by my marriage that one i know how i saw it would never come back i had done something to it i didn t quite know what given it away somehow and yet not as then appeared really got my return i had been assured always by dear fanny that i could get it only i must wake up so i was trying you see to wake up trying very hard yes and to a certain extent you succeeded as also in waking me but you made much he said of your difficulty to which he added it s the only case i remember mag of you ever making anything of a difficulty she kept her eyes on him a moment that i was so happy as i was that you were so happy as you were well you admitted maggie kept it up that that was a good difficulty you confessed that our life did seem to be beautiful he thought a moment yes i may very well have confessed it for so it did seem to me but he guarded himself with his dim his easier smile what do you want to put on me now only that we used to wonder that we were wondering then if our life wasn t perhaps a little selfish this also for a time much at his leisure adam verver retrospectively fixed because fanny assingham thought so oh no she never thought she couldn t think if she would anything of that sort she only thinks people are sometimes fools maggie developed she doesn t seem to think so much about their being wrong wrong that is in the sense of being wicked she doesn t the princess further adventured quite so much mind their being wicked i see i see and yet it might have been for his daughter that he didn t so very vividly see then she only thought us fools oh no i don t say that i m speaking of our being selfish and that comes under the head of the wickedness fanny condones oh i don t say she condones a scruple in maggie raised its crest besides i m speaking of what was her father showed however after a little that he had not been reached by this discrimination his thoughts were resting for the moment where they had settled look here mag he said reflectively i ain t selfish i ll be blowed if i m selfish well maggie if he would talk of that could also pronounce then father i am oh shucks said adam verver to whom the vernacular in moments of deepest sincerity could thus come back i ll believe it he presently added when amerigo complains of you ah it s just he who s my selfishness i m selfish so to speak for him i mean she continued that he s my motive in everything well her father could from experience fancy what she meant but hasn t a girl a right to be selfish about her husband what i don t mean she observed without answering is that i m jealous of him but that s his merit it s not mine her father again seemed amused at her you could be otherwise oh how can i talk she asked of otherwise it isn t luckily for me otherwise if everything were different she further presented her thought of course everything would be and then again as if that were but half my idea is this that when you only love a little you re naturally not jealous or are only jealous also a little so that it doesn t matter but when you love in a deeper and intenser way then you are in the same proportion jealous your jealousy has intensity and no doubt ferocity when however you love in the most abysmal and unutterable way of all why then you re beyond everything and nothing can pull you down mr verver listened as if he had nothing on these high lines to oppose and that s the way you love for a minute she failed to speak but at last she answered it wasn t to talk about that i do feel however beyond everything and as a consequence of that i dare say she added with a turn to gaiety seem often not to know quite where i am the mere fine pulse of passion in it the suggestion as of a creature consciously floating and shining in a warm summer sea some element of dazzling sapphire and silver a creature cradled upon depths buoyant among dangers in which fear or folly or sinking otherwise than in play was impossible something of all this might have been making once more present to him with his discreet his half shy assent to it her probable enjoyment of a rapture that he in his day had presumably convinced no great number of persons either of his giving or of his receiving he sat awhile as if he knew himself hushed almost admonished and not for the first time yet it was an effect that might have brought before him rather what she had gained than what he had missed besides who but himself really knew what he after all hadn t or even had gained the beauty of her condition was keeping him at any rate as he might feel in sight of the sea where though his personal dips were over the whole thing could shine at him and the air and the plash and the play become for him too a sensation that couldn t be fixed upon him as missing since if it wasn t personally floating if it wasn t even sitting in the sand it could yet pass very well for breathing the bliss in a communicated irresistible way for tasting the balm it could pass further for knowing for knowing that without him nothing might have been which would have been missing least of all i guess i ve never been jealous he finally remarked and it said more to her he had occasion next to perceive than he was intending for it made her as by the pressure of a spring give him a look that seemed to tell of things she couldn t speak but she at last tried for one of them oh it s you father who are what i call beyond everything nothing can pull you down he returned the look as with the sociability of their easy communion though inevitably throwing in this time a shade of solemnity he might have been seeing things to say and others whether of a type presumptuous or not doubtless better kept back so he settled on the merely obvious well then we make a pair we re all right oh we re all right a declaration launched not only with all her discriminating emphasis but confirmed by her rising with decision and standing there as if the object of their small excursion required accordingly no further pursuit at this juncture however with the act of their crossing the bar to get as might be into port there occurred the only approach to a betrayal of their having had to beat against the wind her father kept his place and it was as if she had got over first and were pausing for her consort to follow if they were all right they were all right yet he seemed to hesitate and wait for some word beyond his eyes met her own suggestively and it was only after she had contented herself with simply smiling at him smiling ever so fixedly that he spoke for the remaining importance of it from the bench where he leaned back raising his face to her his legs thrust out a trifle wearily and his hands grasping either side of the seat they had beaten against the wind and she was still fresh they had beaten against the wind and he as at the best the more battered vessel perhaps just vaguely drooped but the effect of their silence was that she appeared to beckon him on and he might have been fairly alongside of her when at the end of another minute he found their word the only thing is that as for ever putting up again with your pretending that you re selfish at this she helped him out with it you won t take it from me i won t take it from you well of course you won t for that s your way it doesn t matter and it only proves but it doesn t matter either what it proves i m at this very moment she declared frozen stiff with selfishness he faced her awhile longer in the same way it was strangely as if by this sudden arrest by their having in their acceptance of the unsaid or at least their reference to it practically given up pretending it was as if they were in for it for something they had been ineffably avoiding but the dread of which was itself in a manner a seduction just as any confession of the dread was by so much an allusion then she seemed to see him let himself go when a person s of the nature you speak of there are always other persons to suffer but you ve just been describing to me what you d take if you had once a good chance from your husband oh i m not talking about my husband then whom are you talking about both the retort and the rejoinder had come quicker than anything previously exchanged and they were followed on maggie s part by a momentary drop but she was not to fall away and while her companion kept his eyes on her while she wondered if he weren t expecting her to name his wife then with high hypocrisy as paying for his daughter s bliss she produced something that she felt to be much better i m talking about you do you mean i ve been your victim of course you ve been my victim what have you done ever done that hasn t been for me many things more than i can tell you things you ve only to think of for yourself what do you make of all that i ve done for myself yourself she brightened out with derision what do you make of what i ve done for american city it took her but a moment to say i m not talking of you as a public character i m talking of you on your personal side well american city if personalities can do it has given me a pretty personal side what do you make he went on of what i ve done for my reputation your reputation there you ve given it up to them the awful people for less than nothing you ve given it up to them to tear to pieces to make their horrible vulgar jokes against you with ah my dear i don t care for their horrible vulgar jokes adam verver almost artlessly urged then there exactly you are she triumphed everything that touches you everything that surrounds you goes on by your splendid indifference and your incredible permission at your expense just as he had been sitting he looked at her an instant longer then he slowly rose while his hands stole into his pockets and stood there before her of course my dear you go on at my expense it has never been my idea he smiled that you should work for your living i wouldn t have liked to see it with which for a little again they remained face to face say therefore i have had the feelings of a father how have they made me a victim because i sacrifice you but to what in the world at this it hung before her that she should have had as never yet her opportunity to say and it held her for a minute as in a vise her impression of his now with his strained smile which touched her to deepest depths sounding her in his secret unrest this was the moment in the whole process of their mutual vigilance in which it decidedly most hung by a hair that their thin wall might be pierced by the lightest wrong touch it shook between them this transparency with their very breath it was an exquisite tissue but stretched on a frame and would give way the next instant if either so much as breathed too hard she held her breath for she knew by his eyes the light at the heart of which he couldn t blind that he was by his intention making sure sure whether or no her certainty was like his the intensity of his dependence on it at that moment this itself was what absolutely convinced her so that as if perched up before him on her vertiginous point and in the very glare of his observation she balanced for thirty seconds she almost rocked she might have been for the time in all her conscious person the very form of the equilibrium they were in their different ways equally trying to save and they were saving it yes they were or at least she was that was still the workable issue she could say as she felt her dizziness drop she held herself hard the thing was to be done once for all by her acting now where she stood so much was crowded into so short a space that she knew already she was keeping her head she had kept it by the warning of his eyes she shouldn t lose it again she knew how and why and if she had turned cold this was precisely what helped her he had said to himself she ll break down and name amerigo she ll say it s to him she s sacrificing me and its by what that will give me with so many other things too that my suspicion will be clinched he was watching her lips spying for the symptoms of the sound whereby these symptoms had only to fail and he would have got nothing that she didn t measure out to him as she gave it she had presently in fact so recovered herself that she seemed to know she could more easily have made him name his wife than he have made her name her husband it was there before her that if she should so much as force him just not consciously to avoid saying charlotte charlotte he would have given himself away but to be sure of this was enough for her and she saw more clearly with each lapsing instant what they were both doing he was doing what he had steadily been coming to he was practically offering himself pressing himself upon her as a sacrifice he had read his way so into her best possibility and where had she already for weeks and days past planted her feet if not on her acceptance of the offer cold indeed colder and colder she turned as she felt herself suffer this close personal vision of his attitude still not to make her weaken that was her very certitude the intensity of his pressure for if something dreadful hadn t happened there wouldn t for either of them be these dreadful things to do she had meanwhile as well the immense advantage that she could have named charlotte without exposing herself as for that matter she was the next minute showing him why i sacrifice you simply to everything and to every one i take the consequences of your marriage as perfectly natural he threw back his head a little settling with one hand his eyeglass what do you call my dear the consequences your life as your marriage has made it well hasn t it made it exactly what we wanted she just hesitated then felt herself steady oh beyond what she had dreamed exactly what i wanted yes his eyes through his straightened glasses were still on hers and he might with his intenser fixed smile have been knowing she was for herself rightly inspired what do you make then of what i wanted i don t make anything any more than of what you ve got that s exactly the point i don t put myself out to do so i never have i take from you all i can get all you ve provided for me and i leave you to make of your own side of the matter what you can there you are the rest is your own affair i don t even pretend to concern myself to concern yourself he watched her as she faintly faltered looking about her now so as not to keep always meeting his face with what may have really become of you it s as if we had agreed from the first not to go into that such an arrangement being of course charming for me you can t say you know that i haven t stuck to it he didn t say so then even with the opportunity given him of her stopping once more to catch her breath he said instead oh my dear oh oh but it made no difference know as she might what a past still so recent and yet so distant it alluded to she repeated her denial warning him off on her side from spoiling the truth of her contention i never went into anything and you see i don t i ve continued to adore you but what s that from a decent daughter to such a father what but a question of convenient arrangement our having two houses three houses instead of one you would have arranged for fifty if i had wished and my making it easy for you to see the child you don t claim i suppose that my natural course once you had set up for yourself would have been to ship you back to american city these were direct inquiries they quite rang out in the soft wooded air so that adam verver for a minute appeared to meet them with reflection she saw reflection however quickly enough show him what to do with them do you know mag what you make me wish when you talk that way and he waited again while she further got from him the sense of something that had been behind deeply in the shade coming cautiously to the front and just feeling its way before presenting itself you regularly make me wish that i had shipped back to american city when you go on as you do but he really had to hold himself to say it well when i go on why you make me quite want to ship back myself you make me quite feel as if american city would be the best place for us it made her all too finely vibrate for us for me and charlotte do you know that if we should ship it would serve you quite right with which he smiled oh he smiled and if you say much more we will ship ah then it was that the cup of her conviction full to the brim overflowed at a touch there was his idea the clearness of which for an instant almost dazzled her it was a blur of light in the midst of which she saw charlotte like some object marked by contrast in blackness saw her waver in the field of vision saw her removed transported doomed and he had named charlotte named her again and she had made him which was all she had needed more it was as if she had held a blank letter to the fire and the writing had come out still larger than she hoped the recognition of it took her some seconds but she might when she spoke have been folding up these precious lines and restoring them to her pocket well i shall be as much as ever then the cause of what you do i haven t the least doubt of your being up to that if you should think i might get anything out of it even the little pleasure she laughed of having said as you call it more let my enjoyment of this therefore at any price continue to represent for you what i call sacrificing you she had drawn a long breath she had made him do it all for her and had lighted the way to it without his naming her husband that silence had been as distinct as the sharp the inevitable sound and something now in him followed it up a sudden air as of confessing at last fully to where she was and of begging the particular question don t you think then i can take care of myself ah it s exactly what i ve gone upon if it wasn t for that but she broke off and they remained only another moment face to face i ll let you know my dear the day i feel you ve begun to sacrifice me begun she extravagantly echoed well it will be for me the day you ve ceased to believe in me with which his glasses still fixed on her his hands in his pockets his hat pushed back his legs a little apart he seemed to plant or to square himself for a kind of assurance it had occurred to him he might as well treat her to in default of other things before they changed their subject it had the effect for her of a reminder a reminder of all he was of all he had done of all above and beyond his being her perfect little father she might take him as representing take him as having quite eminently in the eyes of two hemispheres been capable of and as therefore wishing not was it illegitimately to call her attention to the successful beneficent person the beautiful bountiful original dauntlessly wilful great citizen the consummate collector and infallible high authority he had been and still was these things struck her on the spot as making up for him in a wonderful way a character she must take into account in dealing with him either for pity or for envy he positively under the impression seemed to loom larger than life for her so that she saw him during these moments in a light of recognition which had had its brightness for her at many an hour of the past but which had never been so intense and so almost admonitory his very quietness was part of it now as always part of everything of his success his originality his modesty his exquisite public perversity his inscrutable incalculable energy and this quality perhaps it might be all the more too as the result for the present occasion of an admirable traceable effort that placed him in her eyes as no precious a work of art probably had ever been placed in his own there was a long moment absolutely during which her impression rose and rose even as that of the typical charmed gazer in the still museum before the named and dated object the pride of the catalogue that time has polished and consecrated extraordinary in particular was the number of the different ways in which he thus affected her as showing he was strong that was the great thing he was sure sure for himself always whatever his idea the expression of that in him had somehow never appeared more identical with his proved taste for the rare and the true but what stood out beyond everything was that he was always marvellously young which couldn t but crown at this juncture his whole appeal to her imagination before she knew it she was lifted aloft by the consciousness that he was simply a great and deep and high little man and that to love him with tenderness was not to be distinguished a whit from loving him with pride it came to her all strangely as a sudden an immense relief the sense that he wasn t a failure and could never be purged their predicament of every meanness made it as if they had really emerged in their transmuted union to smile almost without pain it was like a new confidence and after another instant she knew even still better why wasn t it because now also on his side he was thinking of her as his daughter was trying her during these mute seconds as the child of his blood oh then if she wasn t with her little conscious passion the child of any weakness what was she but strong enough too it swelled in her fairly it raised her higher higher she wasn t in that case a failure either hadn t been but the contrary his strength was her strength her pride was his and they were decent and competent together this was all in the answer she finally made him i believe in you more than any one than any one at all she hesitated for all it might mean but there was oh a thousand times no doubt of it than any one at all she kept nothing of it back now met his eyes over it let him have the whole of it after which she went on and that s the way i think you believe in me he looked at her a minute longer but his tone at last was right about the way yes well then she spoke as for the end and for other matters for anything everything else there might be they would never return to it well then his hands came out and while her own took them he drew her to his breast and held her he held her hard and kept her long and she let herself go but it was an embrace that august and almost stern produced for all its intimacy no revulsion and broke into no inconsequence of tears xxxviii maggie was to feel after this passage how they had both been helped through it by the influence of that accident of her having been caught a few nights before in the familiar embrace of her father s wife his return to the saloon had chanced to coincide exactly with this demonstration missed moreover neither by her husband nor by the assinghams who their card party suspended had quitted the billiard room with him she had been conscious enough at the time of what such an impression received by the others might in that extended state do for her case and none the less that as no one had appeared to wish to be the first to make a remark about it it had taken on perceptibly the special shade of consecration conferred by unanimities of silence the effect she might have considered had been almost awkward the promptitude of her separation from charlotte as if they had been discovered in some absurdity on her becoming aware of spectators the spectators on the other hand that was the appearance mightn t have supposed them in the existing relation addicted to mutual endearments and yet hesitating with a fine scruple between sympathy and hilarity must have felt that almost any spoken or laughed comment could be kept from sounding vulgar only by sounding beyond any permitted measure intelligent they had evidently looked the two young wives like a pair of women making up effusively as women were supposed to do especially when approved fools after a broil but taking note of the reconciliation would imply on her father s part on amerigo s and on fanny assingham s some proportionate vision of the grounds of their difference there had been something there had been but too much in the incident for each observer yet there was nothing any one could have said without seeming essentially to say see see the dear things their quarrel s blissfully over our quarrel what quarrel the dear things themselves would necessarily in that case have demanded and the wits of the others would thus have been called upon for some agility of exercise no one had been equal to the flight of producing off hand a fictive reason for any estrangement to take that is the place of the true which had so long for the finer sensibility pervaded the air and every one accordingly not to be inconveniently challenged was pretending immediately after to have remarked nothing that any one else hadn t maggie s own measure had remained all the same full of the reflection caught from the total inference which had acted virtually by enabling every one present and oh charlotte not least to draw a long breath the message of the little scene had been different for each but it had been this markedly all round that it reinforced reinforced even immensely the general effort carried on from week to week and of late distinctly more successful to look and talk and move as if nothing in life were the matter supremely however while this glass was held up to her had maggie s sense turned to the quality of the success constituted on the spot for charlotte most of all if she was guessing how her father must have secretly started how her husband must have secretly wondered how fanny assingham must have secretly in a flash seen daylight for herself most of all had she tasted by communication of the high profit involved for her companion she felt in all her pulses charlotte feel it and how publicity had been required absolutely to crown her own abasement it was the added touch and now nothing was wanting which to do her stepmother justice mrs verver had appeared but to desire from that evening to show with the last vividness that she recognised maggie lived over again the minutes in question had found herself repeatedly doing so to the degree that the whole evening hung together to her aftersense as a thing appointed by some occult power that had dealt with her that had for instance animated the four with just the right restlessness too had decreed and directed and exactly timed it in them making their game of bridge however abysmal a face it had worn for her give way precisely to their common unavowed impulse to find out to emulate charlotte s impatience a preoccupation this latter attached detectedly to the member of the party who was roaming in her queerness and was for all their simulated blindness not roaming unnoted if mrs verver meanwhile then had struck her as determined in a certain direction by the last felicity into which that night had flowered our young woman was yet not to fail of appreciating the truth that she had not been put at ease after all with absolute permanence maggie had seen her unmistakably desire to rise to the occasion and be magnificent seen her decide that the right way for this would be to prove that the reassurance she had extorted there under the high cool lustre of the saloon a twinkle of crystal and silver had not only poured oil upon the troubled waters of their question but had fairly drenched their whole intercourse with that lubricant she had exceeded the limit of discretion in this insistence on her capacity to repay in proportion a service she acknowledged as handsome why handsome maggie would have been free to ask since if she had been veracious the service assuredly would not have been huge it would in that case have come up vividly and for each of them alike that the truth on the princess s lips presented no difficulty if the latter s mood in fact could have turned itself at all to private gaiety it might have failed to resist the diversion of seeing so clever a creature so beguiled charlotte s theory of a generous manner was manifestly to express that her stepdaughter s word wiping out as she might have said everything had restored them to the serenity of a relation without a cloud it had been in short in this light ideally conclusive so that no ghost of anything it referred to could ever walk again what was the ecstasy of that however but in itself a trifle compromising as truly within the week maggie had occasion to suspect her friend of beginning and rather abruptly to remember convinced as she was of the example already given her by her husband and in relation to which her profession of trust in his mistress had been an act of conformity exquisitely calculated her imagination yet sought in the hidden play of his influence the explanation of any change of surface any difference of expression or intention there had been through life as we know few quarters in which the princess s fancy could let itself loose but it shook off restraint when it plunged into the figured void of the detail of that relation this was a realm it could people with images again and again with fresh ones they swarmed there like the strange combinations that lurked in the woods at twilight they loomed into the definite and faded into the vague their main present sign for her being however that they were always that they were duskily agitated her earlier vision of a state of bliss made insecure by the very intensity of the bliss this had dropped from her she had ceased to see as she lost herself the pair of operatic of high wagnerian lovers she found deep within her these comparisons interlocked in their wood of enchantment a green glade as romantic as one s dream of an old german forest the picture was veiled on the contrary with the dimness of trouble behind which she felt indistinguishable the procession of forms that had lost all so pitifully their precious confidence therefore though there was in these days for her with amerigo little enough even of the imitation from day to day of unembarrassed references as she had foreseen for that matter from the first that there would be her active conception of his accessibility to their companion s own private and unextinguished right to break ground was not much less active than before so it was that her inner sense in spite of everything represented him as still pulling wires and controlling currents or rather indeed as muffling the whole possibility keeping it down and down leading his accomplice continually on to some new turn of the road as regards herself maggie had become more conscious from week to week of his ingenuities of intention to make up to her for their forfeiture in so dire a degree of any reality of frankness a privation that had left on his lips perhaps a little of the same thirst with which she fairly felt her own distorted the torment of the lost pilgrim who listens in desert sands for the possible the impossible plash of water it was just this hampered state in him none the less that she kept before her when she wished most to find grounds of dignity for the hard little passion which nothing he had done could smother there were hours enough lonely hours in which she let dignity go then there were others when clinging with her winged concentration to some deep cell of her heart she stored away her hived tenderness as if she had gathered it all from flowers he was walking ostensibly beside her but in fact given over without a break to the grey medium in which he helplessly groped a perception on her part which was a perpetual pang and which might last what it would for ever if need be but which if relieved at all must be relieved by his act alone she herself could do nothing more for it she had done the utmost possible it was meantime not the easier to bear for this aspect under which charlotte was presented as depending on him for guidance taking it from him even in doses of bitterness and yet lost with him in devious depths nothing was thus more sharply to be inferred than that he had promptly enough warned her on hearing from her of the precious assurance received from his wife that she must take care her satisfaction didn t betray something of her danger maggie had a day of still waiting after allowing him time to learn how unreservedly she had lied for him of waiting as for the light of she scarce knew what slow shining reflection of this knowledge in his personal attitude what retarded evolution she asked herself in these hours mightn t poor charlotte all unwittingly have precipitated she was thus poor charlotte again for maggie even while maggie s own head was bowed and the reason for this kept coming back to our young woman in the conception of what would secretly have passed she saw her face to face with the prince take from him the chill of his stiffest admonition with the possibilities of deeper difficulty that it represented for each she heard her ask irritated and sombre what tone in god s name since her bravery didn t suit him she was then to adopt and by way of a fantastic flight of divination she heard amerigo reply in a voice of which every fine note familiar and admirable came home to her that one must really manage such prudences a little for one s self it was positive in the princess that for this she breathed charlotte s cold air turned away from him in it with her turned with her in growing compassion this way and that hovered behind her while she felt her ask herself where then she should rest marvellous the manner in which under such imaginations maggie thus circled and lingered quite as if she were materially following her unseen counting every step she helplessly wasted noting every hindrance that brought her to a pause a few days of this accordingly had wrought a change in that apprehension of the instant beatitude of triumph of triumph magnanimous and serene with which the upshot of the night scene on the terrace had condemned our young woman to make terms she had had as we know her vision of the gilt bars bent of the door of the cage forced open from within and the creature imprisoned roaming at large a movement on the creature s part that was to have even for the short interval its impressive beauty but of which the limit and in yet another direction had loomed straight into view during her last talk under the great trees with her father it was when she saw his wife s face ruefully attached to the quarter to which in the course of their session he had so significantly addressed his own it was then that maggie could watch for its turning pale it was then she seemed to know what she had meant by thinking of her in she shadow of his most ominous reference as doomed if as i say her attention now day after day so circled and hovered it found itself arrested for certain passages during which she absolutely looked with charlotte s grave eyes what she unfailingly made out through them was the figure of a little quiet gentleman who mostly wore as he moved alone across the field of vision a straw hat a white waistcoat and a blue necktie keeping a cigar in his teeth and his hands in his pockets and who oftener than not presented a somewhat meditative back while he slowly measured the perspectives of the park and broodingly counted it might have appeared his steps there were hours of intensity for a week or two when it was for all the world as if she had guardedly tracked her stepmother in the great house from room to room and from window to window only to see her here and there and everywhere try her uneasy outlook question her issue and her fate something unmistakably had come up for her that had never come up before it represented a new complication and had begotten a new anxiety things these that she carried about with her done up in the napkin of her lover s accepted rebuke while she vainly hunted for some corner where she might put them safely down the disguised solemnity the prolonged futility of her search might have been grotesque to a more ironic eye but maggie s provision of irony which we have taken for naturally small had never been so scant as now and there were moments while she watched with her thus unseen when the mere effect of being near her was to feel her own heart in her throat was to be almost moved to saying to her hold on tight my poor dear without too much terror and it will all come out somehow even to that indeed she could reflect charlotte might have replied that it was easy to say even to that no great meaning could attach so long as the little meditative man in the straw hat kept coming into view with his indescribable air of weaving his spell weaving it off there by himself in whatever quarter of the horizon the appearances were scanned he was to be noticed as absorbed in this occupation and maggie was to become aware of two or three extraordinary occasions of receiving from him the hint that he measured the impression he produced it was not really till after their recent long talk in the park that she knew how deeply how quite exhaustively they had then communicated so that they were to remain together for the time in consequence quite in the form of a couple of sociable drinkers who sit back from the table over which they have been resting their elbows over which they have emptied to the last drop their respective charged cups the cups were still there on the table but turned upside down and nothing was left for the companions but to confirm by placid silences the fact that the wine had been good they had parted positively as if on either side primed with it primed for whatever was to be and everything between them as the month waned added its touch of truth to this similitude nothing truly was at present between them save that they were looking at each other in infinite trust it fairly wanted no more words and when they met during the deep summer days met even without witnesses when they kissed at morning and evening or on any of the other occasions of contact that they had always so freely celebrated a pair of birds of the upper air could scarce have appeared less to invite each other to sit down and worry afresh so it was that in the house itself where more of his waiting treasures than ever were provisionally ranged she sometimes only looked at him from end to end of the great gallery the pride of the house for instance as if in one of the halls of a museum she had been an earnest young woman with a baedeker and he a vague gentleman to whom even baedekers were unknown he had ever of course had his way of walking about to review his possessions and verify their condition but this was a pastime to which he now struck her as almost extravagantly addicted and when she passed near him and he turned to give her a smile she caught or so she fancied the greater depth of his small perpetual hum of contemplation it was as if he were singing to himself sotto voce as he went and it was also on occasion quite ineffably as if charlotte hovering watching listening on her side too kept sufficiently within earshot to make it out as song and yet for some reason connected with the very manner of it stood off and didn t dare one of the attentions she had from immediately after her marriage most freely paid him was that of her interest in his rarities her appreciation of his taste her native passion for beautiful objects and her grateful desire not to miss anything he could teach her about them maggie had in due course seen her begin to work this fortunately natural source of sympathy for all it was worth she took possession of the mound throughout its extent she abounded to odd excess one might have remarked in the assumption of its being for her with her husband all the ground the finest clearest air and most breathable medium common to them it had been given to maggie to wonder if she didn t in these intensities of approbation too much shut him up to his province but this was a complaint he had never made his daughter and charlotte must at least have had for her that thanks to her admirable instinct her range of perception marching with his own and never falling behind she had probably not so much as once treated him to a rasping mistake or a revealing stupidity maggie wonderfully in the summer days felt it forced upon her that that was one way after all of being a genial wife and it was never so much forced upon her as at these odd moments of her encountering the sposi as amerigo called them under the coved ceilings of fawns while so together yet at the same time so separate they were making their daily round charlotte hung behind with emphasised attention she stopped when her husband stopped but at the distance of a case or two or of whatever other succession of objects and the likeness of their connection would not have been wrongly figured if he had been thought of as holding in one of his pocketed hands the end of a long silken halter looped round her beautiful neck he didn t twitch it yet it was there he didn t drag her but she came and those indications that i have described the princess as finding extraordinary in him were two or three mute facial intimations which his wife s presence didn t prevent his addressing his daughter nor prevent his daughter as she passed it was doubtless to be added from flushing a little at the receipt of they amounted perhaps only to a wordless wordless smile but the smile was the soft shake of the twisted silken rope and maggie s translation of it held in her breast till she got well away came out only as if it might have been overheard when some door was closed behind her yes you see i lead her now by the neck i lead her to her doom and she doesn t so much as know what it is though she has a fear in her heart which if you had the chances to apply your ear there that i as a husband have you would hear thump and thump and thump she thinks it may be her doom the awful place over there awful for her but she s afraid to ask don t you see just as she s afraid of not asking just as she s afraid of so many other things that she sees multiplied round her now as portents and betrayals she ll know however when she does know charlotte s one opportunity meanwhile for the air of confidence she had formerly worn so well and that agreed so with her firm and charming type was the presence of visitors never as the season advanced wholly intermitted rather in fact so constant with all the people who turned up for luncheon and for tea and to see the house now replete now famous that maggie grew to think again of this large element of company as of a kind of renewed water supply for the tank in which like a party of panting gold fish they kept afloat it helped them unmistakably with each other weakening the emphasis of so many of the silences of which their intimate intercourse would otherwise have consisted beautiful and wonderful for her even at times was the effect of these interventions their effect above all in bringing home to each the possible heroism of perfunctory things they learned fairly to live in the perfunctory they remained in it as many hours of the day as might be it took on finally the likeness of some spacious central chamber in a haunted house a great overarched and overglazed rotunda where gaiety might reign but the doors of which opened into sinister circular passages here they turned up for each other as they said with the blank faces that denied any uneasiness felt in the approach here they closed numerous doors carefully behind them all save the door that connected the place as by a straight tented corridor with the outer world and encouraging thus the irruption of society imitated the aperture through which the bedizened performers of the circus are poured into the ring the great part mrs verver had socially played came luckily maggie could make out to her assistance she had personal friends charlotte s personal friends had ever been in london at the two houses one of the most convenient pleasantries who actually tempered at this crisis her aspect of isolation and it wouldn t have been hard to guess that her best moments were those in which she suffered no fear of becoming a bore to restrain her appeal to their curiosity their curiosity might be vague but their clever hostess was distinct and she marched them about sparing them nothing as if she counted each day on a harvest of half crowns maggie met her again in the gallery at the oddest hours with the party she was entertaining heard her draw out the lesson insist upon the interest snub even the particular presumption and smile for the general bewilderment inevitable features these latter of almost any occasion in a manner that made our young woman herself incurably dazzled marvel afresh at the mystery by which a creature who could be in some connexions so earnestly right could be in others so perversely wrong when her father vaguely circulating was attended by his wife it was always charlotte who seemed to bring up the rear but he hung in the background when she did cicerone and it was then perhaps that moving mildly and modestly to and fro on the skirts of the exhibition his appearance of weaving his spell was for the initiated conscience least to be resisted brilliant women turned to him in vague emotion but his response scarce committed him more than if he had been the person employed to see that after the invading wave was spent the cabinets were all locked and the symmetries all restored there was a morning when during the hour before luncheon and shortly after the arrival of a neighbourly contingent neighbourly from ten miles off whom mrs verver had taken in charge maggie paused on the threshold of the gallery through which she had been about to pass faltered there for the very impression of his face as it met her from an opposite door charlotte half way down the vista held together as if by something almost austere in the grace of her authority the semi scared now that they were there knot of her visitors who since they had announced themselves by telegram as yearning to inquire and admire saw themselves restricted to this consistency her voice high and clear and a little hard reached her husband and her step daughter while she thus placed beyond doubt her cheerful submission to duty her words addressed to the largest publicity rang for some minutes through the place every one as quiet to listen as if it had been a church ablaze with tapers and she were taking her part in some hymn of praise fanny assingham looked rapt in devotion fanny assingham who forsook this other friend as little as she forsook either her host or the princess or the prince or the principino she supported her in slow revolutions in murmurous attestations of presence at all such times and maggie advancing after a first hesitation was not to fail of noting her solemn inscrutable attitude her eyes attentively lifted so that she might escape being provoked to betray an impression she betrayed one however as maggie approached dropping her gaze to the latter s level long enough to seem to adventure marvellously on a mute appeal you understand don t you that if she didn t do this there would be no knowing what she might do this light mrs assingham richly launched while her younger friend unresistingly moved became uncertain again and then not too much to show it or rather positively to conceal it and to conceal something more as well turned short round to one of the windows and awkwardly pointlessly waited the largest of the three pieces has the rare peculiarity that the garlands looped round it which as you see are the finest possible vieux saxe are not of the same origin or period or even wonderful as they are of a taste quite so perfect they have been put on at a later time by a process of which there are very few examples and none so important as this which is really quite unique so that though the whole thing is a little baroque its value as a specimen is i believe almost inestimable so the high voice quavered aiming truly at effects far over the heads of gaping neighbours so the speaker piling it up sticking at nothing as less interested judges might have said seemed to justify the faith with which she was honoured maggie meanwhile at the window knew the strangest thing to be happening she had turned suddenly to crying or was at least on the point of it the lighted square before her all blurred and dim the high voice went on its quaver was doubtless for conscious ears only but there were verily thirty seconds during which it sounded for our young woman like the shriek of a soul in pain kept up a minute longer it would break and collapse so that maggie felt herself the next thing turn with a start to her father can t she be stopped hasn t she done it enough some such question as that she let herself ask him to suppose in her then it was that across half the gallery for he had not moved from where she had first seen him he struck her as confessing with strange tears in his own eyes to sharp identity of emotion poor thing poor thing it reached straight isn t she for one s credit on the swagger after which as held thus together they had still another strained minute the shame the pity the better knowledge the smothered protest the divined anguish even so overcame him that blushing to his eyes he turned short away the affair but of a few muffled moments this snatched communion yet lifted maggie as on air so much for deep guesses on her own side too it gave her to think of there was honestly an awful mixture in things and it was not closed to her aftersense of such passages we have already indeed in other cases seen it open that the deepest depth of all in a perceived penalty was that you couldn t be sure some of your compunctions and contortions wouldn t show for ridiculous amerigo that morning for instance had been as absent as he at this juncture appeared to desire he should mainly be noted as being he had gone to london for the day and the night a necessity that now frequently rose for him and that he had more than once suffered to operate during the presence of guests successions of pretty women the theory of his fond interest in whom had been publicly cultivated it had never occurred to his wife to pronounce him ingenuous but there came at last a high dim august dawn when she couldn t sleep and when creeping restlessly about and breathing at her window the coolness of wooded acres she found the faint flush of the east march with the perception of that other almost equal prodigy it rosily coloured her vision that even such as he was yes her husband could on occasion sin by excess of candour he wouldn t otherwise have given as his reason for going up to portland place in the august days that he was arranging books there he had bought a great many of late and he had had others a large number sent from rome wonders of old print in which her father had been interested but when her imagination tracked him to the dusty town to the house where drawn blinds and pale shrouds where a caretaker and a kitchenmaid were alone in possession it wasn t to see him in his shirtsleeves unpacking battered boxes she saw him in truth less easily beguiled saw him wander in the closed dusky rooms from place to place or else for long periods recline on deep sofas and stare before him through the smoke of ceaseless cigarettes she made him out as liking better than anything in the world just now to be alone with his thoughts being herself connected with his thoughts she continued to believe more than she had ever been it was thereby a good deal as if he were alone with her she made him out as resting so from that constant strain of the perfunctory to which he was exposed at fawns and she was accessible to the impression of the almost beggared aspect of this alternative it was like his doing penance in sordid ways being sent to prison or being kept without money it wouldn t have taken much to make her think of him as really kept without food he might have broken away might easily have started to travel he had a right thought wonderful maggie now to so many more freedoms than he took his secret was of course that at fawns he all the while winced was all the while in presences in respect to which he had thrown himself back with a hard pressure on whatever mysteries of pride whatever inward springs familiar to the man of the world he could keep from snapping maggie for some reason had that morning while she watched the sunrise taken an extraordinary measure of the ground on which he would have had to snatch at pretexts for absence it all came to her there he got off to escape from a sound the sound was in her own ears still that of charlotte s high coerced quaver before the cabinets in the hushed gallery the voice by which she herself had been pierced the day before as by that of a creature in anguish and by which while she sought refuge at the blurred window the tears had been forced into her eyes her comprehension soared so high that the wonder for her became really his not feeling the need of wider intervals and thicker walls before that admiration she also meditated consider as she might now she kept reading not less into what he omitted than into what he performed a beauty of intention that touched her fairly the more by being obscure it was like hanging over a garden in the dark nothing was to be made of the confusion of growing things but one felt they were folded flowers and their vague sweetness made the whole air their medium he had to turn away but he wasn t at least a coward he would wait on the spot for the issue of what he had done on the spot she sank to her knees with her arm on the ledge of her window seat where she blinded her eyes from the full glare of seeing that his idea could only be to wait whatever might come at her side it was to her buried face that she thus for a long time felt him draw nearest though after a while when the strange wail of the gallery began to repeat its inevitable echo she was conscious of how that brought out his pale hard grimace xxxix the resemblance had not been present to her on first coming out into the hot still brightness of the sunday afternoon only the second sunday of all the summer when the party of six the party of seven including the principino had practically been without accessions or invasions but within sight of charlotte seated far away very much where she had expected to find her the princess fell to wondering if her friend wouldn t be affected quite as she herself had been that night on the terrace under mrs verver s perceptive pursuit the relation to day had turned itself round charlotte was seeing her come through patches of lingering noon quite as she had watched charlotte menace her through the starless dark and there was a moment that of her waiting a little as they thus met across the distance when the interval was bridged by a recognition not less soundless and to all appearance not less charged with strange meanings than that of the other occasion the point however was that they had changed places maggie had from her window seen her stepmother leave the house at so unlikely an hour three o clock of a canicular august for a ramble in garden or grove and had thereupon felt her impulse determined with the same sharpness that had made the spring of her companion s three weeks before it was the hottest day of the season and the shaded siesta for people all at their ease would certainly rather have been prescribed but our young woman had perhaps not yet felt it so fully brought home that such refinements of repose among them constituted the empty chair at the feast this was the more distinct as the feast literally in the great bedimmed dining room the cool ceremonious semblance of luncheon had just been taking place without mrs verver she had been represented but by the plea of a bad headache not reported to the rest of the company by her husband but offered directly to mr verver himself on their having assembled by her maid deputed for the effect and solemnly producing it maggie had sat down with the others to viands artfully iced to the slow circulation of precious tinkling jugs to marked reserves of reference in many directions poor fanny assingham herself scarce thrusting her nose out of the padded hollow into which she had withdrawn a consensus of languor which might almost have been taken for a community of dread ruled the scene relieved only by the fitful experiments of father mitchell good holy hungry man a trusted and overworked london friend and adviser who had taken for a week or two the light neighbouring service local rites flourishing under maggie s munificence and was enjoying as a convenience all the bounties of the house he conversed undiscouraged father mitchell conversed mainly with the indefinite wandering smile of the entertainers and the princess s power to feel him on the whole a blessing for these occasions was not impaired by what was awkward in her consciousness of having from the first of her trouble really found her way without his guidance she asked herself at times if he suspected how more than subtly how perversely she had dispensed with him and she balanced between visions of all he must privately have guessed and certitudes that he had guessed nothing whatever he might nevertheless have been so urbanely filling up gaps at present for the very reason that his instinct sharper than the expression of his face had sufficiently served him made him aware of the thin ice figuratively speaking and of prolongations of tension round about him mostly foreign to the circles in which luxury was akin to virtue some day in some happier season she would confess to him that she hadn t confessed though taking so much on her conscience but just now she was carrying in her weak stiffened hand a glass filled to the brim as to which she had recorded a vow that no drop should overflow she feared the very breath of a better wisdom the jostle of the higher light of heavenly help itself and in addition however that might be she drew breath this afternoon as never yet in an element heavy to oppression something grave had happened somehow and somewhere and she had god knew her choice of suppositions her heart stood still when she wondered above all if the cord mightn t at last have snapped between her husband and her father she shut her eyes for dismay at the possibility of such a passage there moved before them the procession of ugly forms it might have taken find out for yourself she had thrown to amerigo for her last word on the question of who else knew that night of the breaking of the bowl and she flattered herself that she hadn t since then helped him in her clear consistency by an inch it was what she had given him all these weeks to be busy with and she had again and again lain awake for the obsession of this sense of his uncertainty ruthlessly and endlessly playing with his dignity she had handed him over to an ignorance that couldn t even try to become indifferent and that yet wouldn t project itself either into the cleared air of conviction in proportion as he was generous it had bitten into his spirit and more than once she had said to herself that to break the spell she had cast upon him and that the polished old ivory of her father s inattackable surface made so absolute he would suddenly commit some mistake or some violence smash some windowpane for air fail even of one of his blest inveteracies of taste in that way fatally he would have put himself in the wrong blighting by a single false step the perfection of his outward show these shadows rose and fell for her while father mitchell prattled with other shadows as well those that hung over charlotte herself those that marked her as a prey to equal suspicions to the idea in particular of a change such a change as she didn t dare to face in the relations of the two men or there were yet other possibilities as it seemed to maggie there were always too many and all of them things of evil when one s nerves had at last done for one all that nerves could do had left one in a darkness of prowling dangers that was like the predicament of the night watcher in a beast haunted land who has no more means for a fire she might with such nerves have supposed almost anything of any one anything almost of poor bob assingham condemned to eternal observances and solemnly appreciating her father s wine anything verily yes of the good priest as he finally sat back with fat folded hands and twiddled his thumbs on his stomach the good priest looked hard at the decanters at the different dishes of dessert he eyed them half obliquely as if they might have met him to day for conversation better than any one present but the princess had her fancy at last about that too she was in the midst of a passage before she knew it between father mitchell and charlotte some approach he would have attempted with her that very morning perhaps to the circumstance of an apparent detachment recently noted in her from any practice of devotion he would have drawn from this say his artless inference taken it for a sign of some smothered inward trouble and pointed naturally the moral that the way out of such straits was not through neglect of the grand remedy he had possibly prescribed contrition he had at any rate quickened in her the beat of that false repose to which our young woman s own act had devoted her at her all so deluded instance the falsity of it had laid traps compared to which the imputation of treachery even accepted might have seemed a path of roses the acceptance strangely would have left her nothing to do she could have remained had she liked all insolently passive whereas the failure to proceed against her as it might have been called left her everything and all the more that it was wrapped so in confidence she had to confirm day after day the rightness of her cause and the justice and felicity of her exemption so that wouldn t there have been fairly in any explicit concern of father mitchell s depths of practical derision of her success the question was provisionally answered at all events by the time the party at luncheon had begun to disperse with maggie s version of mrs verver sharp to the point of representing her pretext for absence as a positive flight from derision she met the good priest s eyes before they separated and priests were really at the worst so to speak such wonderful people that she believed him for an instant on the verge of saying to her in abysmal softness go to mrs verver my child you go you ll find that you can help her this didn t come however nothing came but the renewed twiddle of thumbs over the satisfied stomach and the full flush the comical candour of reference to the hand employed at fawns for mayonnaise of salmon nothing came but the receding backs of each of the others her father s slightly bent shoulders in especial which seemed to weave his spell by the force of habit not less patiently than if his wife had been present her husband indeed was present to feel anything there might be to feel which was perhaps exactly why this personage was moved promptly to emulate so definite an example of sloping he had his occupations books to arrange perhaps even at fawns the idea of the siesta moreover in all the conditions had no need to be loudly invoked maggie was in the event left alone for a minute with mrs assingham who after waiting for safety appeared to have at heart to make a demonstration the stage of talking over had long passed for them when they communicated now it was on quite ultimate facts but fanny desired to testify to the existence on her part of an attention that nothing escaped she was like the kind lady who happening to linger at the circus while the rest of the spectators pour grossly through the exits falls in with the overworked little trapezist girl the acrobatic support presumably of embarrassed and exacting parents and gives her as an obscure and meritorious artist assurance of benevolent interest what was clearest always in our young woman s imaginings was the sense of being herself left for any occasion in the breach she was essentially there to bear the burden in the last resort of surrounding omissions and evasions and it was eminently to that office she had been to day abandoned with this one alleviation as appeared of mrs assingham s keeping up with her mrs assingham suggested that she too was still on the ramparts though her gallantry proved indeed after a moment to consist not a little of her curiosity she had looked about and seen their companions beyond earshot don t you really want us to go maggie found a faint smile do you really want to it made her friend colour well then no but we would you know at a look from you we d pack up and be off as a sacrifice ah make no sacrifice said maggie see me through that s it that s all i want i should be too base besides fanny went on you re too splendid splendid splendid also you know you are all but through you ve done it said mrs assingham but maggie only half took it from her what does it strike you that i ve done what you wanted they re going maggie continued to look at her is that what i wanted oh it wasn t for you to say that was his business my father s maggie asked after an hesitation your father s he has chosen and now she knows she sees it all before her and she can t speak or resist or move a little finger that s what s the matter with her said fanny assingham it made a picture somehow for the princess as they stood there the picture that the words of others whatever they might be always made for her even when her vision was already charged better than any words of her own she saw round about her through the chinks of the shutters the hard glare of nature saw charlotte somewhere in it virtually at bay and yet denied the last grace of any protecting truth she saw her off somewhere all unaided pale in her silence and taking in her fate has she told you she then asked her companion smiled superior i don t need to be told either i see something thank god every day and then as maggie might appear to be wondering what for instance i see the long miles of ocean and the dreadful great country state after state which have never seemed to me so big or so terrible i see them at last day by day and step by step at the far end and i see them never come back but never simply i see the extraordinary interesting place which i ve never been to you know and you have and the exact degree in which she will be expected to be interested she will be maggie presently replied expected interested for a little after this their eyes met on it at the end of which fanny said she ll be yes what she ll have to be and it will be won t it for ever and ever she spoke as abounding in her friend s sense but it made maggie still only look at her these were large words and large visions all the more that now really they spread and spread in the midst of them however mrs assingham had soon enough continued when i talk of knowing indeed i don t mean it as you would have a right to do you know because you see and i don t see him i don t make him out she almost crudely confessed maggie again hesitated you mean you don t make out amerigo but fanny shook her head and it was quite as if as an appeal to one s intelligence the making out of amerigo had in spite of everything long been superseded then maggie measured the reach of her allusion and how what she next said gave her meaning a richness no other name was to be spoken and mrs assingham had taken that without delay from her eyes with a discretion still that fell short but by an inch you know how he feels maggie at this then slowly matched her headshake i know nothing you know how you feel but again she denied it i know nothing if i did well if you did fanny asked as she faltered she had had enough however i should die she said as she turned away she went to her room through the quiet house she roamed there a moment picking up pointlessly a different fan and then took her way to the shaded apartments in which at this hour the principino would be enjoying his nap she passed through the first empty room the day nursery and paused at an open door the inner room large dim and cool was equally calm her boy s ample antique historical royal crib consecrated reputedly by the guarded rest of heirs apparent and a gift early in his career from his grandfather ruled the scene from the centre in the stillness of which she could almost hear the child s soft breathing the prime protector of his dreams was installed beside him her father sat there with as little motion with head thrown back and supported with eyes apparently closed with the fine foot that was so apt to betray nervousness at peace upon the other knee with the unfathomable heart folded in the constant flawless freshness of the white waistcoat that could always receive in its armholes the firm prehensile thumbs mrs noble had majestically melted and the whole place signed her temporary abdication yet the actual situation was regular and maggie lingered but to look she looked over her fan the top of which was pressed against her face long enough to wonder if her father really slept or if aware of her he only kept consciously quiet did his eyes truly fix her between lids partly open and was she to take this his forebearance from any question only as a sign again that everything was left to her she at all events for a minute watched his immobility then as if once more renewing her total submission returned without a sound to her own quarters a strange impulse was sharp in her but it was not for her part the desire to shift the weight she could as little have slept as she could have slept that morning days before when she had watched the first dawn from her window turned to the east this side of her room was now in shade with the two wings of the casement folded back and the charm she always found in her seemingly perched position as if her outlook from above the high terraces was that of some castle tower mounted on a rock when she stood there she hung over over the gardens and the woods all of which drowsed below her at this hour in the immensity of light the miles of shade looked hot the banks of flowers looked dim the peacocks on the balustrades let their tails hang limp and the smaller birds lurked among the leaves nothing therefore would have appeared to stir in the brilliant void if maggie at the moment she was about to turn away had not caught sight of a moving spot a clear green sunshade in the act of descending a flight of steps it passed down from the terrace receding at a distance from sight and carried naturally so as to conceal the head and back of its bearer but maggie had quickly recognised the white dress and the particular motion of this adventurer had taken in that charlotte of all people had chosen the glare of noon for an exploration of the gardens and that she could be betaking herself only to some unvisited quarter deep in them or beyond them that she had already marked as a superior refuge the princess kept her for a few minutes in sight watched her long enough to feel her by the mere betrayal of her pace and direction driven in a kind of flight and then understood for herself why the act of sitting still had become impossible to either of them there came to her confusedly some echo of an ancient fable some vision of io goaded by the gadfly or of ariadne roaming the lone sea strand it brought with it all the sense of her own intention and desire she too might have been for the hour some far off harassed heroine only with a part to play for which she knew exactly no inspiring precedent she knew but that all the while all the while of her sitting there among the others without her she had wanted to go straight to this detached member of the party and make somehow for her support the last demonstration a pretext was all that was needful and maggie after another instant had found one she had caught a glimpse before mrs verver disappeared of her carrying a book made out half lost in the folds of her white dress the dark cover of a volume that was to explain her purpose in case of her being met with surprise and the mate of which precisely now lay on maggie s table the book was an old novel that the princess had a couple of days before mentioned having brought down from portland place in the charming original form of its three volumes charlotte had hailed with a specious glitter of interest the opportunity to read it and our young woman had thereupon on the morrow directed her maid to carry it to mrs verver s apartments she was afterwards to observe that this messenger unintelligent or inadvertent had removed but one of the volumes which happened not to be the first still possessed accordingly of the first while charlotte going out fantastically at such an hour to cultivate romance in an arbour was helplessly armed with the second maggie prepared on the spot to sally forth with succour the right volume with a parasol was all she required in addition that is to the bravery of her general idea she passed again through the house unchallenged and emerged upon the terrace which she followed hugging the shade with that consciousness of turning the tables on her friend which we have already noted but so far as she went after descending into the open and beginning to explore the grounds mrs verver had gone still further with the increase of the oddity moreover of her having exchanged the protection of her room for these exposed and shining spaces it was not fortunately however at last that by persisting in pursuit one didn t arrive at regions of admirable shade this was the asylum presumably that the poor wandering woman had had in view several wide alleys in particular of great length densely overarched with the climbing rose and the honeysuckle and converging in separate green vistas at a sort of umbrageous temple an ancient rotunda pillared and statued niched and roofed yet with its uncorrected antiquity like that of everything else at fawns conscious hitherto of no violence from the present and no menace from the future charlotte had paused there in her frenzy or what ever it was to be called the place was a conceivable retreat and she was staring before her from the seat to which she appeared to have sunk all unwittingly as maggie stopped at the beginning of one of the perspectives it was a repetition more than ever then of the evening on the terrace the distance was too great to assure her she had been immediately seen but the princess waited with her intention as charlotte on the other occasion had waited allowing oh allowing for the difference of the intention maggie was full of the sense of that so full that it made her impatient whereupon she moved forward a little placing herself in range of the eyes that had been looking off elsewhere but that she had suddenly called to recognition charlotte had evidently not dreamed of being followed and instinctively with her pale stare she stiffened herself for protest maggie could make that out as well as further however that her second impression of her friend s approach had an instant effect on her attitude the princess came nearer gravely and in silence but fairly paused again to give her time for whatever she would whatever she would whatever she could was what maggie wanted wanting above all to make it as easy for her as the case permitted that was not what charlotte had wanted the other night but this never mattered the great thing was to allow her was fairly to produce in her the sense of highly choosing at first clearly she had been frightened she had not been pursued it had quickly struck her without some design on the part of her pursuer and what might she not be thinking of in addition but the way she had when herself the pursuer made her stepdaughter take in her spirit and her purpose it had sunk into maggie at the time that hard insistence and mrs verver had felt it and seen it and heard it sink which wonderful remembrance of pressure successfully applied had naturally till now remained with her but her stare was like a projected fear that the buried treasure so dishonestly come by for which her companion s still countenance at the hour and afterwards had consented to serve as the deep soil might have worked up again to the surface to be thrown back upon her hands yes it was positive that during one of these minutes the princess had the vision of her particular alarm it s her lie it s her lie that has mortally disagreed with her she can keep down no longer her rebellion at it and she has come to retract it to disown it and denounce it to give me full in my face the truth instead this for a concentrated instant maggie felt her helplessly gasp but only to let it bring home the indignity the pity of her state she herself could but tentatively hover place in view the book she carried look as little dangerous look as abjectly mild as possible remind herself really of people she had read about in stories of the wild west people who threw up their hands on certain occasions as a sign they weren t carrying revolvers she could almost have smiled at last troubled as she yet knew herself to show how richly she was harmless she held up her volume which was so weak a weapon and while she continued for consideration to keep her distance she explained with as quenched a quaver as possible i saw you come out saw you from my window and couldn t bear to think you should find yourself here without the beginning of your book this is the beginning you ve got the wrong volume and i ve brought you out the right she remained after she had spoken it was like holding a parley with a possible adversary and her intense her exalted little smile asked for formal leave may i come nearer now she seemed to say as to which however the next minute she saw charlotte s reply lose itself in a strange process a thing of several sharp stages which she could stand there and trace the dread after a minute had dropped from her face though discernibly enough she still couldn t believe in her having in so strange a fashion been deliberately made up to if she had been made up to at least it was with an idea the idea that had struck her at first as necessarily dangerous that it wasn t insistently wasn t this shone from maggie with a force finally not to be resisted and on that perception on the immense relief so constituted everything had by the end of three minutes extraordinarily changed maggie had come out to her really because she knew her doomed doomed to a separation that was like a knife in her heart and in the very sight of her uncontrollable her blinded physical quest of a peace not to be grasped something of mrs assingham s picture of her as thrown for a grim future beyond the great sea and the great continent had at first found fulfilment she had got away in this fashion burning behind her almost the ships of disguise to let her horror of what was before her play up without witnesses and even after maggie s approach had presented an innocent front it was still not to be mistaken that she bristled with the signs of her extremity it was not to be said for them either that they were draped at this hour in any of her usual graces unveiled and all but unashamed they were tragic to the princess in spite of the dissimulation that with the return of comparative confidence was so promptly to operate how tragic in essence the very change made vivid the instant stiffening of the spring of pride this for possible defence if not for possible aggression pride indeed the next moment had become the mantle caught up for protection and perversity she flung it round her as a denial of any loss of her freedom to be doomed was in her situation to have extravagantly incurred a doom so that to confess to wretchedness was by the same stroke to confess to falsity she wouldn t confess she didn t a thousand times no she only cast about her and quite frankly and fiercely for something else that would give colour to her having burst her bonds her eyes expanded her bosom heaved as she invoked it and the effect upon maggie was verily to wish she could only help her to it she presently got up which seemed to mean oh stay if you like and when she had moved about awhile at random looking away looking at anything at everything but her visitor when she had spoken of the temperature and declared that she revelled in it when she had uttered her thanks for the book which a little incoherently with her second volume she perhaps found less clever than she expected when she had let maggie approach sufficiently closer to lay untouched the tribute in question on a bench and take up obligingly its superfluous mate when she had done these things she sat down in another place more or less visibly in possession of her part our young woman was to have passed in all her adventure no stranger moments for she not only now saw her companion fairly agree to take her then for the poor little person she was finding it so easy to appear but fell in a secret responsive ecstasy to wondering if there were not some supreme abjection with which she might be inspired vague but increasingly brighter this possibility glimmered on her it at last hung there adequately plain to charlotte that she had presented herself once more to as they said grovel and that truly made the stage large it had absolutely within the time taken on the dazzling merit of being large for each of them alike i m glad to see you alone there s something i ve been wanting to say to you i m tired said mrs verver i m tired tired it had dropped the next thing it couldn t all come at once but maggie had already guessed what it was and the flush of recognition was in her face tired of this life the one we ve been leading you like it i know but i ve dreamed another dream she held up her head now her lighted eyes more triumphantly rested she was finding she was following her way maggie by the same influence sat in sight of it there was something she was saving some quantity of which she herself was judge and it was for a long moment even with the sacrifice the princess had come to make a good deal like watching her from the solid shore plunge into uncertain into possibly treacherous depths i see something else she went on i ve an idea that greatly appeals to me i ve had it for a long time it has come over me that we re wrong our real life isn t here maggie held her breath ours my husband s and mine i m not speaking for you oh said maggie only praying not to be not even to appear stupid i m speaking for ourselves i m speaking charlotte brought out for him i see for my father for your father for whom else they looked at each other hard now but maggie s face took refuge in the intensity of her interest she was not at all even so stupid as to treat her companion s question as requiring an answer a discretion that her controlled stillness had after an instant justified i must risk your thinking me selfish for of course you know what it involves let me admit it i am selfish i place my husband first well said maggie smiling and smiling since that s where i place mine you mean you ll have no quarrel with me so much the better then for charlotte went on with a higher and higher flight my plan is completely formed maggie waited her glimmer had deepened her chance somehow was at hand the only danger was her spoiling it she felt herself skirting an abyss what then may i ask is your plan it hung fire but ten seconds it came out sharp to take him home to his real position and not to wait do you mean a this season i mean immediately and i may as well tell you now i mean for my own time i want charlotte said to have him at last a little to myself i want strange as it may seem to you and she gave it all its weight to keep the man i ve married and to do so i see i must act maggie with the effort still to follow the right line felt herself colour to the eyes immediately she thoughtfully echoed as soon as we can get off the removal of everything is after all but a detail that can always be done with money as he spends it everything can what i ask for charlotte declared is the definite break and i wish it now with which her head like her voice rose higher oh she added i know my difficulty far down below the level of attention in she could scarce have said what sacred depths maggie s inspiration had come and it had trembled the next moment into sound do you mean i m your difficulty you and he together since it s always with you that i ve had to see him but it s a difficulty that i m facing if you wish to know that i ve already faced that i propose to myself to surmount the struggle with it none too pleasant hasn t been for me as you may imagine in itself charming i ve felt in it at times if i must tell you all too great and too strange an ugliness yet i believe it may succeed she had risen with this mrs verver and had moved for the emphasis of it a few steps away while maggie motionless at first but sat and looked at her you want to take my father from me the sharp successful almost primitive wail in it made charlotte turn and this movement attested for the princess the felicity of her deceit something in her throbbed as it had throbbed the night she stood in the drawing room and denied that she had suffered she was ready to lie again if her companion would but give her the opening then she should know she had done all charlotte looked at her hard as if to compare her face with her note of resentment and maggie feeling this met it with the signs of an impression that might pass for the impression of defeat i want really to possess him said mrs verver i happen also to feel that he s worth it maggie rose as if to receive her oh worth it she wonderfully threw off the tone she instantly saw again had its effect charlotte flamed aloft might truly have been believing in her passionate parade you ve thought you ve known what he s worth indeed then my dear i believe i have as i believe i still do she had given it maggie straight back and again it had not missed charlotte for another moment only looked at her then broke into the words maggie had known they would come of which she had pressed the spring how i see that you loathed our marriage do you ask me maggie after an instant demanded charlotte had looked about her picked up the parasol she had laid on a bench possessed herself mechanically of one of the volumes of the relegated novel and then more consciously flung it down again she was in presence visibly of her last word she opened her sunshade with a click she twirled it on her shoulder in her pride ask you do i need how i see she broke out that you ve worked against me oh oh oh the princess exclaimed her companion leaving her had reached one of the archways but on this turned round with a flare you haven t worked against me maggie took it and for a moment kept it held it with closed eyes as if it had been some captured fluttering bird pressed by both hands to her breast then she opened her eyes to speak what does it matter if i ve failed you recognise then that you ve failed asked charlotte from the threshold maggie waited she looked as her companion had done a moment before at the two books on the seat she put them together and laid them down then she made up her mind i ve failed she sounded out before charlotte having given her time walked away she watched her splendid and erect float down the long vista then she sank upon a seat yes she had done all part sixth xl i ll do anything you like she said to her husband on one of the last days of the month if our being here this way at this time seems to you too absurd or too uncomfortable or too impossible we ll either take leave of them now without waiting or we ll come back in time three days before they start i ll go abroad with you if you but say the word to switzerland the tyrol the italian alps to whichever of your old high places you would like most to see again those beautiful ones that used to do you good after rome and that you so often told me about where they were in the conditions that prompted this offer and where it might indeed appear ridiculous that with the stale london september close at hand they should content themselves with remaining was where the desert of portland place looked blank as it had never looked and where a drowsy cabman scanning the horizon for a fare could sink to oblivion of the risks of immobility but amerigo was of the odd opinion day after day that their situation couldn t be bettered and he even went at no moment through the form of replying that should their ordeal strike her as exceeding their patience any step they might take would be for her own relief this was no doubt partly because he stood out so wonderfully to the end against admitting by a weak word at least that any element of their existence was or ever had been an ordeal no trap of circumstance no lapse of form no accident of irritation had landed him in that inconsequence his wife might verily have suggested that he was consequent consequent with the admirable appearance he had from the first so undertaken and so continued to present rather too rigidly at her expense only as it happened she was not the little person to do anything of the sort and the strange tacit compact actually in operation between them might have been founded on an intelligent comparison a definite collation positively of the kinds of patience proper to each she was seeing him through he had engaged to come out at the right end if she would see him this understanding tacitly renewed from week to week had fairly received with the procession of the weeks the consecration of time but it scarce needed to be insisted on that she was seeing him on his terms not all on hers or that in other words she must allow him his unexplained and uncharted his one practicably workable way if that way by one of the intimate felicities the liability to which was so far from having even yet completely fallen from him happened handsomely to show him as more bored than boring with advantages of his own freely to surrender but none to be persuadedly indebted to others for what did such a false face of the matter represent but the fact itself that she was pledged if she had questioned or challenged or interfered if she had reserved herself that right she wouldn t have been pledged whereas there were still and evidently would be yet a while long tense stretches during which their case might have been hanging for every eye on her possible her impossible defection she must keep it up to the last mustn t absent herself for three minutes from her post only on those lines assuredly would she show herself as with him and not against him it was extraordinary how scant a series of signs she had invited him to make of being of truly having been at any time with his wife that reflection she was not exempt from as they now in their suspense supremely waited a reflection under the brush of which she recognised her having had in respect to him as well to do all to go the whole way over to move indefatigably while he stood as fixed in his place as some statue of one of his forefathers the meaning of it would seem to be she reasoned in sequestered hours that he had a place and that this was an attribute somehow indefeasible unquenchable which laid upon others from the moment they definitely wanted anything of him the necessity of taking more of the steps that he could of circling round him of remembering for his benefit the famous relation of the mountain to mahomet it was strange if one had gone into it but such a place as amerigo s was like something made for him beforehand by innumerable facts facts largely of the sort known as historical made by ancestors examples traditions habits while maggie s own had come to show simply as that improvised post a post of the kind spoken of as advanced with which she was to have found herself connected in the fashion of a settler or a trader in a new country in the likeness even of some indian squaw with a papoose on her back and barbarous bead work to sell maggie s own in short would have been sought in vain in the most rudimentary map of the social relations as such the only geography marking it would be doubtless that of the fundamental passions the end that the prince was at all events holding out for was represented to expectation by his father in law s announced departure for america with mrs verver just as that prospective event had originally figured as advising for discretion the flight of the younger couple to say nothing of the withdrawal of whatever other importunate company before the great upheaval of fawns this residence was to be peopled for a month by porters packers and hammerers at whose operations it had become peculiarly public public that is for portland place that charlotte was to preside in force operations the quite awful appointed scale and style of which had at no moment loomed so large to maggie s mind as one day when the dear assinghams swam back into her ken besprinkled with sawdust and looking as pale as if they had seen samson pull down the temple they had seen at least what she was not seeing rich dim things under the impression of which they had retired she having eyes at present but for the clock by which she timed her husband or for the glass the image perhaps would be truer in which he was reflected to her as he timed the pair in the country the accession of their friends from cadogan place contributed to all their intermissions at any rate a certain effect of resonance an effect especially marked by the upshot of a prompt exchange of inquiries between mrs assingham and the princess it was noted on the occasion of that anxious lady s last approach to her young friend at fawns that her sympathy had ventured after much accepted privation again to become inquisitive and it had perhaps never so yielded to that need as on this question of the present odd line of the distinguished eccentrics you mean to say really that you re going to stick here and then before maggie could answer what on earth will you do with your evenings maggie waited a moment maggie could still tentatively smile when people learn we re here and of course the papers will be full of it they ll flock back in their hundreds from wherever they are to catch us you see you and the colonel have yourselves done it as for our evenings they won t i dare say be particularly different from anything else that s ours they won t be different from our mornings or our afternoons except perhaps that you two dears will sometimes help us to get through them i ve offered to go anywhere she added to take a house if he will but this just this and nothing else is amerigo s idea he gave it yesterday she went on a name that as he said described and fitted it so you see and the princess indulged again in her smile that didn t play but that only as might have been said worked so you see there s a method in our madness it drew mrs assingham s wonder and what then is the name the reduction to its simplest expression of what we are doing that s what he called it therefore as we re doing nothing we re doing it in the most aggravated way which is the way he desires with which maggie further said of course i understand so do i her visitor after a moment breathed you ve had to vacate the house that was inevitable but at least here he doesn t funk our young woman accepted the expression he doesn t funk it only however half contented fanny who thoughtfully raised her eyebrows he s prodigious but what is there as you ve fixed it to dodge unless she pursued it s her getting near him it s if you ll pardon my vulgarity her getting at him that she suggested may count with him but it found the princess prepared she can get near him here she can get at him she can come up can she fanny assingham questioned can t she maggie returned their eyes for a minute intimately met on it after which the elder woman said i mean for seeing him alone so do i said the princess at which fanny for her reasons couldn t help smiling oh if it s for that he s staying he s staying i ve made it out to take anything that comes or calls upon him to take maggie went on even that then she put it as she had at last put it to herself he s staying for high decency decency mrs assingham gravely echoed decency if she should try well mrs assingham urged well i hope hope he ll see her maggie hesitated however she made no direct reply it s useless hoping she presently said she won t but he ought to her friend s expression of a moment before which had been apologised for as vulgar prolonged its sharpness to her ear that of an electric bell under continued pressure stated so simply what was it but dreadful truly that the feasibility of charlotte s getting at the man who for so long had loved her should now be in question strangest of all things doubtless this care of maggie s as to what might make for it or make against it stranger still her fairly lapsing at moments into a vague calculation of the conceivability on her own part with her husband of some direct sounding of the subject would it be too monstrous her suddenly breaking out to him as in alarm at the lapse of the weeks wouldn t it really seem that you re bound in honour to do something for her privately before they go maggie was capable of weighing the risk of this adventure for her own spirit capable of sinking to intense little absences even while conversing as now with the person who had most of her confidence during which she followed up the possibilities it was true that mrs assingham could at such times somewhat restore the balance by not wholly failing to guess her thought her thought however just at present had more than one face had a series that it successively presented these were indeed the possibilities involved in the adventure of her concerning herself for the quantity of compensation that mrs verver might still look to there was always the possibility that she was after all sufficiently to get at him there was in fact that of her having again and again done so against this stood nothing but fanny assingham s apparent belief in her privation more mercilessly imposed or more hopelessly felt in the actual relation of the parties over and beyond everything that from more than three months back of course had fostered in the princess a like conviction these assumptions might certainly be baseless inasmuch as there were hours and hours of amerigo s time that there was no habit no pretence of his accounting for inasmuch too as charlotte inevitably had had more than once to the undisguised knowledge of the pair in portland place been obliged to come up to eaton square whence so many of her personal possessions were in course of removal she didn t come to portland place didn t even come to ask for luncheon on two separate occasions when it reached the consciousness of the household there that she was spending the day in london maggie hated she scorned to compare hours and appearances to weigh the idea of whether there hadn t been moments during these days when an assignation in easy conditions a snatched interview in an air the season had so cleared of prying eyes mightn t perfectly work but the very reason of this was partly that haunted with the vision of the poor woman carrying off with such bravery as she found to her hand the secret of her not being appeased she was conscious of scant room for any alternative image the alternative image would have been that the secret covered up was the secret of appeasement somehow obtained somehow extorted and cherished and the difference between the two kinds of hiding was too great to permit of a mistake charlotte was hiding neither pride nor joy she was hiding humiliation and here it was that the princess s passion so powerless for vindictive flights most inveterately bruised its tenderness against the hard glass of her question behind the glass lurked the whole history of the relation she had so fairly flattened her nose against it to penetrate the glass mrs verver might at this stage have been frantically tapping from within by way of supreme irrepressible entreaty maggie had said to herself complacently after that last passage with her stepmother in the garden of fawns that there was nothing left for her to do and that she could thereupon fold her hands but why wasn t it still left to push further and from the point of view of personal pride grovel lower why wasn t it still left to offer herself as the bearer of a message reporting to him their friend s anguish and convincing him of her need she could thus have translated mrs verver s tap against the glass as i have called it into fifty forms could perhaps have translated it most into the form of a reminder that would pierce deep you don t know what it is to have been loved and broken with you haven t been broken with because in your relation what can there have been worth speaking of to break ours was everything a relation could be filled to the brim with the wine of consciousness and if it was to have no meaning no better meaning than that such a creature as you could breathe upon it at your hour for blight why was i myself dealt with all for deception why condemned after a couple of short years to find the golden flame oh the golden flame a mere handful of black ashes our young woman so yielded at moments to what was insidious in these foredoomed ingenuities of her pity that for minutes together sometimes the weight of a new duty seemed to rest upon her the duty of speaking before separation should constitute its chasm of pleading for some benefit that might be carried away into exile like the last saved object of price of the emigre the jewel wrapped in a piece of old silk and negotiable some day in the market of misery this imagined service to the woman who could no longer help herself was one of the traps set for maggie s spirit at every turn of the road the click of which catching and holding the divine faculty fast was followed inevitably by a flutter by a struggle of wings and even as we may say by a scattering of fine feathers for they promptly enough felt these yearnings of thought and excursions of sympathy the concussion that couldn t bring them down the arrest produced by the so remarkably distinct figure that at fawns for the previous weeks was constantly crossing in its regular revolution the further end of any watched perspective whoever knew or whoever didn t whether or to what extent charlotte with natural business in eaton square had shuffled other opportunities under that cloak it was all matter for the kind of quiet ponderation the little man who so kept his wandering way had made his own it was part of the very inveteracy of his straw hat and his white waistcoat of the trick of his hands in his pockets of the detachment of the attention he fixed on his slow steps from behind his secure pince nez the thing that never failed now as an item in the picture was that gleam of the silken noose his wife s immaterial tether so marked to maggie s sense during her last month in the country mrs verver s straight neck had certainly not slipped it nor had the other end of the long cord oh quite conveniently long disengaged its smaller loop from the hooked thumb that with his fingers closed upon it her husband kept out of sight to have recognised for all its tenuity the play of this gathered lasso might inevitably be to wonder with what magic it was twisted to what tension subjected but could never be to doubt either of its adequacy to its office or of its perfect durability these reminded states for the princess were in fact states of renewed gaping so many things her father knew that she even yet didn t all this at present with mrs assingham passed through her in quick vibrations she had expressed while the revolution of her thought was incomplete the idea of what amerigo ought on his side in the premises to be capable of and then had felt her companion s answering stare but she insisted on what she had meant he ought to wish to see her and i mean in some protected and independent way as he used to in case of her being herself able to manage it that said maggie with the courage of her conviction he ought to be ready he ought to be happy he ought to feel himself sworn little as it is for the end of such a history to take from her it s as if he wished to get off without taking anything mrs assingham deferentially mused but for what purpose is it your idea that they should again so intimately meet for any purpose they like that s their affair fanny assingham sharply laughed then irrepressibly fell back to her constant position you re splendid perfectly splendid to which as the princess shaking an impatient head wouldn t have it again at all she subjoined or if you re not it s because you re so sure i mean sure of him ah i m exactly not sure of him if i were sure of him i shouldn t doubt but maggie cast about her doubt what fanny pressed as she waited well that he must feel how much less than she he pays and how that ought to keep her present to him this in its turn after an instant mrs assingham could meet with a smile trust him my dear to keep her present but trust him also to keep himself absent leave him his own way i ll leave him everything said maggie only you know it s my nature i think it s your nature to think too much fanny assingham a trifle coarsely risked this but quickened however in the princess the act she reprobated that may be but if i hadn t thought you wouldn t you mean have been where you are yes because they on their side thought of everything but that they thought of everything but that i might think or even her friend too superficially concurred that your father might as to this at all events maggie discriminated no that wouldn t have prevented them for they knew that his first care would be not to make me do so as it is maggie added that has had to become his last fanny assingham took it in deeper for what it immediately made her give out louder he s splendid then she sounded it almost aggressively it was what she was reduced to she had positively to place it ah that as much as you please maggie said this and left it but the tone of it had the next moment determined in her friend a fresh reaction you think both of you so abysmally and yet so quietly but it s what will have saved you oh maggie returned it s what from the moment they discovered we could think at all will have saved them for they re the ones who are saved she went on we re the ones who are lost lost lost to each other father and i and then as her friend appeared to demur oh yes maggie quite lucidly declared lost to each other much more really than amerigo and charlotte are since for them it s just it s right it s deserved while for us it s only sad and strange and not caused by our fault but i don t know she went on why i talk about myself for it s on father it really comes i let him go said maggie you let him but you don t make him i take it from him she answered but what else can you do i take it from him the princess repeated i do what i knew from the first i should do i get off by giving him up but if he gives you mrs assingham presumed to object doesn t it moreover then she asked complete the very purpose with which he married that of making you and leaving you more free maggie looked at her long yes i help him to do that mrs assingham hesitated but at last her bravery flared why not call it then frankly his complete success well said maggie that s all that s left me to do it s a success her friend ingeniously developed with which you ve simply not interfered and as if to show that she spoke without levity mrs assingham went further he has made it a success for them ah there you are maggie responsively mused yes she said the next moment that s why amerigo stays let alone it s why charlotte goes that mrs assingham and emboldened smiled so he knows but maggie hung back amerigo after which however she blushed to her companion s recognition your father he knows what you know i mean fanny faltered well how much does he know maggie s silence and maggie s eyes had in fact arrested the push of the question which for a decent consistency she couldn t yet quite abandon what i should rather say is does he know how much she found it still awkward how much i mean they did how far she touched it up they went maggie had waited but only with a question do you think he does know at least something oh about him i can t think he s beyond me said fanny assingham then do you yourself know how much how much how far how far fanny had appeared to wish to make sure but there was something she remembered remembered in time and even with a smile i ve told you before that i know absolutely nothing well that s what i know said the princess her friend again hesitated then nobody knows i mean mrs assingham explained how much your father does oh maggie showed that she understood nobody not a little charlotte a little the princess echoed to know anything would be for her to know enough and she doesn t know anything if she did maggie answered amerigo would and that s just it that he doesn t that s just it said the princess profoundly on which mrs assingham reflected then how is charlotte so held just by that by her ignorance by her ignorance fanny wondered a torment a torment said maggie with tears in her eyes her companion a moment watched them but the prince then how is he held maggie asked how is he held oh i can t tell you that and the princess again broke off xli a telegram in charlotte s name arrived early we shall come and ask you for tea at five if convenient to you am wiring for the assinghams to lunch this document into which meanings were to be read maggie promptly placed before her husband adding the remark that her father and his wife who would have come up the previous night or that morning had evidently gone to an hotel the prince was in his own room where he often sat now alone half a dozen open newspapers the figaro notably as well as the times were scattered about him but with a cigar in his teeth and a visible cloud on his brow he appeared actually to be engaged in walking to and fro never yet on thus approaching him for she had done it of late under one necessity or another several times had a particular impression so greeted her supremely strong for some reason as he turned quickly round on her entrance the reason was partly the look in his face a suffusion like the flush of fever which brought back to her fanny assingham s charge recently uttered under that roof of her thinking too impenetrably the word had remained with her and made her think still more so that at first as she stood there she felt responsible for provoking on his part an irritation of suspense at which she had not aimed she had been going about him these three months she perfectly knew with a maintained idea of which she had never spoken to him but what had at last happened was that his way of looking at her on occasion seemed a perception of the presence not of one idea but of fifty variously prepared for uses with which he somehow must reckon she knew herself suddenly almost strangely glad to be coming to him at this hour with nothing more abstract than a telegram but even after she had stepped into his prison under her pretext while her eyes took in his face and then embraced the four walls that enclosed his restlessness she recognised the virtual identity of his condition with that aspect of charlotte s situation for which early in the summer and in all the amplitude of a great residence she had found with so little seeking the similitude of the locked cage he struck her as caged the man who couldn t now without an instant effect on her sensibility give an instinctive push to the door she had not completely closed behind her he had been turning twenty ways for impatiences all his own and when she was once shut in with him it was yet again as if she had come to him in his more than monastic cell to offer him light or food there was a difference none the less between his captivity and charlotte s the difference as it might be of his lurking there by his own act and his own choice the admission of which had indeed virtually been in his starting on her entrance as if even this were in its degree an interference that was what betrayed for her practically his fear of her fifty ideas and what had begun after a minute to make her wish to repudiate or explain it was more wonderful than she could have told it was for all the world as if she was succeeding with him beyond her intention she had for these instants the sense that he exaggerated that the imputation of purpose had fairly risen too high in him she had begun a year ago by asking herself how she could make him think more of her but what was it after all he was thinking now he kept his eyes on her telegram he read it more than once easy as it was in spite of its conveyed deprecation to understand during which she found herself almost awestruck with yearning almost on the point of marking somehow what she had marked in the garden at fawns with charlotte that she had truly come unarmed she didn t bristle with intentions she scarce knew as he at this juncture affected her what had become of the only intention she had come with she had nothing but her old idea the old one he knew she hadn t the ghost of another presently in fact when four or five minutes had elapsed it was as if she positively hadn t so much even as that one he gave her back her paper asking with it if there were anything in particular she wished him to do she stood there with her eyes on him doubling the telegram together as if it had been a precious thing and yet all the while holding her breath of a sudden somehow and quite as by the action of their merely having between them these few written words an extraordinary fact came up he was with her as if he were hers hers in a degree and on a scale with an intensity and an intimacy that were a new and a strange quantity that were like the irruption of a tide loosening them where they had stuck and making them feel they floated what was it that with the rush of this just kept her from putting out her hands to him from catching at him as in the other time with the superficial impetus he and charlotte had privately conspired to impart she had so often her breath failing her known the impulse to catch at her father she did however just yet nothing inconsequent though she couldn t immediately have said what saved her and by the time she had neatly folded her telegram she was doing something merely needful i wanted you simply to know so that you mayn t by accident miss them for it s the last said maggie the last i take it as their good bye and she smiled as she could always smile they come in state to take formal leave they do everything that s proper tomorrow she said they go to southampton if they do everything that s proper the prince presently asked why don t they at least come to dine she hesitated yet she lightly enough provided her answer that we must certainly ask them it will be easy for you but of course they re immensely taken he wondered so immensely taken that they can t that your father can t give you his last evening in england this for maggie was more difficult to meet yet she was still not without her stop gap that may be what they ll propose that we shall go somewhere together the four of us for a celebration except that to round it thoroughly off we ought also to have fanny and the colonel they don t want them at tea she quite sufficiently expresses they polish them off poor dears they get rid of them beforehand they want only us together and if they cut us down to tea she continued as they cut fanny and the colonel down to luncheon perhaps it s for the fancy after all of their keeping their last night in london for each other she said these things as they came to her she was unable to keep them back even though as she heard herself she might have been throwing everything to the winds but wasn t that the right way for sharing his last day of captivity with the man one adored it was every moment more and more for her as if she were waiting with him in his prison waiting with some gleam of remembrance of how noble captives in the french revolution the darkness of the terror used to make a feast or a high discourse of their last poor resources if she had broken with everything now every observance of all the past months she must simply then take it so take it that what she had worked for was too near at last to let her keep her head she might have been losing her head verily in her husband s eyes since he didn t know all the while that the sudden freedom of her words was but the diverted intensity of her disposition personally to seize him he didn t know either that this was her manner now she was with him of beguiling audaciously the supremacy of suspense for the people of the french revolution assuredly there wasn t suspense the scaffold for those she was thinking of was certain whereas what charlotte s telegram announced was short of some incalculable error clear liberation just the point however was in its being clearer to herself than to him her clearnesses clearances those she had so all but abjectly laboured for threatened to crowd upon her in the form of one of the clusters of angelic heads the peopled shafts of light beating down through iron bars that regale on occasion precisely the fevered vision of those who are in chains she was going to know she felt later on was going to know with compunction doubtless on the very morrow how thumpingly her heart had beaten at this foretaste of their being left together she should judge at leisure the surrender she was making to the consciousness of complications about to be bodily lifted she should judge at leisure even that avidity for an issue which was making so little of any complication but the unextinguished presence of the others and indeed that she was already simplifying so much more than her husband came out for her next in the face with which he listened he might certainly well be puzzled in respect to his father in law and mrs verver by her glance at their possible preference for a concentrated evening but it isn t is it he asked as if they were leaving each other oh no it isn t as if they were leaving each other they re only bringing to a close without knowing when it may open again a time that has been naturally awfully interesting to them yes she could talk so of their time she was somehow sustained she was sustained even to affirm more intensely her present possession of her ground they have their reasons many things to think of how can one tell but there s always also the chance of his proposing to me that we shall have our last hours together i mean that he and i shall he may wish to take me off to dine with him somewhere alone and to do it in memory of old days i mean the princess went on the real old days before my grand husband was invented and much more before his grand wife was the wonderful times of his first great interest in what he has since done his first great plans and opportunities discoveries and bargains the way we ve sat together late ever so late in foreign restaurants which he used to like the way that in every city in europe we ve stayed on and on with our elbows on the table and most of the lights put out to talk over things he had that day seen or heard of or made his offer for the things he had secured or refused or lost there were places he took me to you wouldn t believe for often he could only have left me with servants if he should carry me off with him to night for old sake s sake to the earl s court exhibition it will be a little just a very very little like our young adventures after which while amerigo watched her and in fact quite because of it she had an inspiration to which she presently yielded if he was wondering what she would say next she had found exactly the thing in that case he will leave you charlotte to take care of in our absence you ll have to carry her off somewhere for your last evening unless you may prefer to spend it with her here i shall then see that you dine that you have everything quite beautifully you ll be able to do as you like she couldn t have been sure beforehand and had really not been but the most immediate result of this speech was his letting her see that he took it for no cheap extravagance either of irony or of oblivion nothing in the world of a truth had ever been so sweet to her as his look of trying to be serious enough to make no mistake about it she troubled him which hadn t been at all her purpose she mystified him which she couldn t help and comparatively didn t mind then it came over her that he had after all a simplicity very considerable on which she had never dared to presume it was a discovery not like the other discovery she had once made but giving out a freshness and she recognised again in the light of it the number of the ideas of which he thought her capable they were all apparently queer for him but she had at least with the lapse of the months created the perception that there might be something in them whereby he stared there beautiful and sombre at what she was at present providing him with there was something of his own in his mind to which she was sure he referred everything for a measure and a meaning he had never let go of it from the evening weeks before when in her room after his encounter with the bloomsbury cup she had planted it there by flinging it at him on the question of her father s view of him her determined find out for yourself she had been aware during the months that he had been trying to find out and had been seeking above all to avoid the appearance of any evasions of such a form of knowledge as might reach him with violence or with a penetration more insidious from any other source nothing however had reached him nothing he could at all conveniently reckon with had disengaged itself for him even from the announcement sufficiently sudden of the final secession of their companions charlotte was in pain charlotte was in torment but he himself had given her reason enough for that and in respect to the rest of the whole matter of her obligation to follow her husband that personage and she maggie had so shuffled away every link between consequence and cause that the intention remained like some famous poetic line in a dead language subject to varieties of interpretation what renewed the obscurity was her strange image of their common offer to him her father s and her own of an opportunity to separate from mrs verver with the due amount of form and all the more that he was in so pathetic a way unable to treat himself to a quarrel with it on the score of taste taste in him as a touchstone was now all at sea for who could say but that one of her fifty ideas or perhaps forty nine of them wouldn t be exactly that taste by itself the taste he had always conformed to had no importance whatever if meanwhile at all events he felt her as serious this made the greater reason for her profiting by it as she perhaps might never be able to profit again she was invoking that reflection at the very moment he brought out in reply to her last words a remark which though perfectly relevant and perfectly just affected her at first as a high oddity they re doing the wisest thing you know for if they were ever to go and he looked down at her over his cigar if they were ever to go in short it was high time with her father s age charlotte s need of initiation and the general magnitude of the job of their getting settled and seasoned their learning to live into their queer future it was high time that they should take up their courage this was eminent sense but it didn t arrest the princess who the next moment had found a form for her challenge but shan t you then so much as miss her a little she s wonderful and beautiful and i feel somehow as if she were dying not really not physically maggie went on she s so far naturally splendid as she is from having done with life but dying for us for you and me and making us feel it by the very fact of there being so much of her left the prince smoked hard a minute as you say she s splendid but there is there always will be much of her left only as you also say for others and yet i think the princess returned that it isn t as if we had wholly done with her how can we not always think of her it s as if her unhappiness had been necessary to us as if we had needed her at her own cost to build us up and start us he took it in with consideration but he met it with a lucid inquiry why do you speak of the unhappiness of your father s wife they exchanged a long look the time that it took her to find her reply because not to well not to would make me have to speak of him and i can t said maggie speak of him you can t i can t she said it as for definite notice not to be repeated there are too many things she nevertheless added he s too great the prince looked at his cigar tip and then as he put back the weed too great for whom upon which as she hesitated not my dear too great for you he declared for me oh as much as you like too great for me is what i mean i know why i think it maggie said that s enough he looked at her yet again as if she but fanned his wonder he was on the very point she judged of asking her why she thought it but her own eyes maintained their warning and at the end of a minute he had uttered other words what s of importance is that you re his daughter that at least we ve got and i suppose that if i may say nothing else i may say at least that i value it oh yes you may say that you value it i myself make the most of it this again he took in letting it presently put forth for him a striking connection she ought to have known you that s what s present to me she ought to have understood you better better than you did yes he gravely maintained better than i did and she didn t really know you at all she doesn t know you now ah yes she does said maggie but he shook his head he knew what he meant she not only doesn t understand you more than i she understands you ever so much less though even i well even you maggie pressed as he paused even i even i even yet again he paused and the silence held them but maggie at last broke it if charlotte doesn t understand me it is that i ve prevented her i ve chosen to deceive her and to lie to her the prince kept his eyes on her i know what you ve chosen to do but i ve chosen to do the same yes said maggie after an instant my choice was made when i had guessed yours but you mean she asked that she understands you it presents small difficulty are you so sure maggie went on sure enough but it doesn t matter he waited an instant then looking up through the fumes of his smoke she s stupid he abruptly opined o oh maggie protested in a long wail it had made him in fact quickly change colour what i mean is that she s not as you pronounce her unhappy and he recovered with this all his logic why is she unhappy if she doesn t know doesn t know she tried to make his logic difficult doesn t know that you know it came from him in such a way that she was conscious instantly of three or four things to answer but what she said first was do you think that s all it need take and before he could reply she knows she knows maggie proclaimed well then what but she threw back her head she turned impatiently away from him oh i needn t tell you she knows enough besides she went on she doesn t believe us it made the prince stare a little ah she asks too much that drew however from his wife another moan of objection which determined in him a judgment she won t let you take her for unhappy oh i know better than any one else what she won t let me take her for very well said amerigo you ll see i shall see wonders i know i ve already seen them and i m prepared for them maggie recalled she had memories enough it s terrible her memories prompted her to speak i see it s always terrible for women the prince looked down in his gravity everything s terrible cara in the heart of man she s making her life he said she ll make it his wife turned back upon him she had wandered to a table vaguely setting objects straight a little by the way then too while she s about it she s making ours at this he raised his eyes which met her own and she held him while she delivered herself of some thing that had been with her these last minutes you spoke just now of charlotte s not having learned from you that i know am i to take from you then that you accept and recognise my knowledge he did the inquiry all the honours visibly weighed its importance and weighed his response you think i might have been showing you that a little more handsomely it isn t a question of any beauty said maggie it s only a question of the quantity of truth oh the quantity of truth the prince richly though ambiguously murmured that s a thing by itself yes but there are also such things all the same as questions of good faith of course there are the prince hastened to reply after which he brought up more slowly if ever a man since the beginning of time acted in good faith but he dropped it offering it simply for that for that then when it had had time somewhat to settle like some handful of gold dust thrown into the air for that then maggie showed herself as deeply and strangely taking it i see and she even wished this form to be as complete as she could make it i see the completeness clearly after an instant had struck him as divine ah my dear my dear my dear it was all he could say she wasn t talking however at large you ve kept up for so long a silence yes yes i know what i ve kept up but will you do he asked still one thing more for me it was as if for an instant with her new exposure it had made her turn pale is there even one thing left ah my dear my dear my dear it had pressed again in him the fine spring of the unspeakable there was nothing however that the princess herself couldn t say i ll do anything if you ll tell me what then wait and his raised italian hand with its play of admonitory fingers had never made gesture more expressive his voice itself dropped to a tone wait he repeated wait she understood but it was as if she wished to have it from him till they ve been here you mean yes till they ve gone till they re away she kept it up till they ve left the country she had her eyes on him for clearness these were the conditions of a promise so that he put the promise practically into his response till we ve ceased to see them for as long as god may grant till we re really alone oh if it s only that when she had drawn from him thus then as she could feel the thick breath of the definite which was the intimate the immediate the familiar as she hadn t had them for so long she turned away again she put her hand on the knob of the door but her hand rested at first without a grasp she had another effort to make the effort of leaving him of which everything that had just passed between them his presence irresistible overcharged with it doubled the difficulty there was something she couldn t have told what it was as if shut in together they had come too far too far for where they were so that the mere act of her quitting him was like the attempt to recover the lost and gone she had taken in with her something that within the ten minutes and especially within the last three or four had slipped away from her which it was vain now wasn t it to try to appear to clutch or to pick up that consciousness in fact had a pang and she balanced intensely for the lingering moment almost with a terror of her endless power of surrender he had only to press really for her to yield inch by inch and she fairly knew at present while she looked at him through her cloud that the confession of this precious secret sat there for him to pluck the sensation for the few seconds was extraordinary her weakness her desire so long as she was yet not saving herself flowered in her face like a light or a darkness she sought for some word that would cover this up she reverted to the question of tea speaking as if they shouldn t meet sooner then about five i count on you on him too however something had descended as to which this exactly gave him his chance ah but i shall see you no he said coming nearer she had with her hand still on the knob her back against the door so that her retreat under his approach must be less than a step and yet she couldn t for her life with the other hand have pushed him away he was so near now that she could touch him taste him smell him kiss him hold him he almost pressed upon her and the warmth of his face frowning smiling she mightn t know which only beautiful and strange was bent upon her with the largeness with which objects loom in dreams she closed her eyes to it and so the next instant against her purpose she had put out her hand which had met his own and which he held then it was that from behind her closed eyes the right word came wait it was the word of his own distress and entreaty the word for both of them all they had left their plank now on the great sea their hands were locked and thus she said it again wait wait she kept her eyes shut but her hand she knew helped her meaning which after a minute she was aware his own had absorbed he let her go he turned away with this message and when she saw him again his back was presented as he had left her and his face staring out of the window she had saved herself and she got off xlii later on in the afternoon before the others arrived the form of their reunion was at least remarkable they might in their great eastward drawing room have been comparing notes or nerves in apprehension of some stiff official visit maggie s mind in its restlessness even played a little with the prospect the high cool room with its afternoon shade with its old tapestries uncovered with the perfect polish of its wide floor reflecting the bowls of gathered flowers and the silver and linen of the prepared tea table drew from her a remark in which this whole effect was mirrored as well as something else in the prince s movement while he slowly paced and turned we re distinctly bourgeois she a trifle grimly threw off as an echo of their old community though to a spectator sufficiently detached they might have been quite the privileged pair they were reputed granted only they were taken as awaiting the visit of royalty they might have been ready on the word passed up in advance to repair together to the foot of the staircase the prince somewhat in front advancing indeed to the open doors and even going down for all his princedom to meet on the stopping of the chariot the august emergence the time was stale it was to be admitted for incidents of magnitude the september hush was in full possession at the end of the dull day and a couple of the long windows stood open to the balcony that overhung the desolation the balcony from which maggie in the springtime had seen amerigo and charlotte look down together at the hour of her return from the regent s park near by with her father the principino and miss bogle amerigo now again in his punctual impatience went out a couple of times and stood there after which as to report that nothing was in sight he returned to the room with frankly nothing else to do the princess pretended to read he looked at her as he passed there hovered in her own sense the thought of other occasions when she had cheated appearances of agitation with a book at last she felt him standing before her and then she raised her eyes do you remember how this morning when you told me of this event i asked you if there were anything particular you wished me to do you spoke of my being at home but that was a matter of course you spoke of something else he went on while she sat with her book on her knee and her raised eyes something that makes me almost wish it may happen you spoke he said of the possibility of my seeing her alone do you know if that comes he asked the use i shall make of it and then as she waited the use is all before me ah it s your own business now said his wife but it had made her rise i shall make it my own he answered i shall tell her i lied to her ah no she returned and i shall tell her you did she shook her head again oh still less with which therefore they stood at difference he with his head erect and his happy idea perched in its eagerness on his crest and how then is she to know she isn t to know she s only still to think you don t and therefore that i m always a fool she may think said maggie what she likes think it without my protest the princess made a movement what business is it of yours isn t it my right to correct her maggie let his question ring ring long enough for him to hear it himself only then she took it up correct her and it was her own now that really rang aren t you rather forgetting who she is after which while he quite stared for it as it was the very first clear majesty he had known her to use she flung down her book and raised a warning hand the carriage come the come had matched for lucid firmness the rest of her speech and when they were below in the hall there was a go for him through the open doors and between the ranged servants that matched even that he received royalty bareheaded therefore in the persons of mr and mrs verver as it alighted on the pavement and maggie was at the threshold to welcome it to her house later on upstairs again she even herself felt still more the force of the limit of which she had just reminded him at tea in charlotte s affirmed presence as charlotte affirmed it she drew a long breath of richer relief it was the strangest once more of all impressions but what she most felt for the half hour was that mr and mrs verver were making the occasion easy they were somehow conjoined in it conjoined for a present effect as maggie had absolutely never yet seen them and there occurred before long a moment in which amerigo s look met her own in recognitions that he couldn t suppress the question of the amount of correction to which charlotte had laid herself open rose and hovered for the instant only to sink conspicuously by its own weight so high a pitch she seemed to give to the unconsciousness of questions so resplendent a show of serenity she succeeded in making the shade of the official in her beauty and security never for a moment dropped it was a cool high refuge like the deep arched recess of some coloured and gilded image in which she sat and smiled and waited drank her tea referred to her husband and remembered her mission her mission had quite taken form it was but another name for the interest of her great opportunity that of representing the arts and the graces to a people languishing afar off in ignorance maggie had sufficiently intimated to the prince ten minutes before that she needed no showing as to what their friend wouldn t consent to be taken for but the difficulty now indeed was to choose for explicit tribute of admiration between the varieties of her nobler aspects she carried it off to put the matter coarsely with a taste and a discretion that held our young woman s attention for the first quarter of an hour to the very point of diverting it from the attitude of her overshadowed her almost superseded companion but adam verver profited indeed at this time even with his daughter by his so marked peculiarity of seeming on no occasion to have an attitude and so long as they were in the room together she felt him still simply weave his web and play out his long fine cord knew herself in presence of this tacit process very much as she had known herself at fawns he had a way the dear man wherever he was of moving about the room noiselessly to see what it might contain and his manner of now resorting to this habit acquainted as he already was with the objects in view expressed with a certain sharpness the intention of leaving his wife to her devices it did even more than this it signified to the apprehension of the princess from the moment she more directly took thought of him almost a special view of these devices as actually exhibited in their rarity together with an independent a settled appreciation of their general handsome adequacy which scarcely required the accompaniment of his faint contemplative hum charlotte throned as who should say between her hostess and her host the whole scene having crystallised as soon as she took her place to the right quiet lustre the harmony was not less sustained for being superficial and the only approach to a break in it was while amerigo remained standing long enough for his father in law vaguely wondering to appeal to him invite or address him and then in default of any such word selected for presentation to the other visitor a plate of petits fours maggie watched her husband if it now could be called watching offer this refreshment she noted the consummate way for consummate was the term she privately applied in which charlotte cleared her acceptance cleared her impersonal smile of any betrayal any slightest value of consciousness and then felt the slow surge of a vision that at the end of another minute or two had floated her across the room to where her father stood looking at a picture an early florentine sacred subject that he had given her on her marriage he might have been in silence taking his last leave of it it was a work for which he entertained she knew an unqualified esteem the tenderness represented for her by his sacrifice of such a treasure had become to her sense a part of the whole infusion of the immortal expression the beauty of his sentiment looked out at her always from the beauty of the rest as if the frame made positively a window for his spiritual face she might have said to herself at this moment that in leaving the thing behind him held as in her clasping arms he was doing the most possible toward leaving her a part of his palpable self she put her hand over his shoulder and their eyes were held again together by the abiding felicity they smiled in emulation vaguely as if speech failed them through their having passed too far she would have begun to wonder the next minute if it were reserved to them for the last stage to find their contact like that of old friends reunited too much on the theory of the unchanged subject to shy lapses it s all right eh oh my dear rather he had applied the question to the great fact of the picture as she had spoken for the picture in reply but it was as if their words for an instant afterwards symbolised another truth so that they looked about at everything else to give them this extension she had passed her arm into his and the other objects in the room the other pictures the sofas the chairs the tables the cabinets the important pieces supreme in their way stood out round them consciously for recognition and applause their eyes moved together from piece to piece taking in the whole nobleness quite as if for him to measure the wisdom of old ideas the two noble persons seated in conversation at tea fell thus into the splendid effect and the general harmony mrs verver and the prince fairly placed themselves however unwittingly as high expressions of the kind of human furniture required esthetically by such a scene the fusion of their presence with the decorative elements their contribution to the triumph of selection was complete and admirable though to a lingering view a view more penetrating than the occasion really demanded they also might have figured as concrete attestations of a rare power of purchase there was much indeed in the tone in which adam verver spoke again and who shall say where his thought stopped le compte y est you ve got some good things maggie met it afresh ah don t they look well their companions at the sound of this gave them in a spacious intermission of slow talk an attention all of gravity that was like an ampler submission to the general duty of magnificence sitting as still to be thus appraised as a pair of effigies of the contemporary great on one of the platforms of madame tussaud i m so glad for your last look with which after maggie quite in the air had said it the note was struck indeed the note of that strange accepted finality of relation as from couple to couple which almost escaped an awkwardness only by not attempting a gloss yes this was the wonder that the occasion defied insistence precisely because of the vast quantities with which it dealt so that separation was on a scale beyond any compass of parting to do such an hour justice would have been in some degree to question its grounds which was why they remained in fine the four of them in the upper air united in the firmest abstention from pressure there was no point visibly at which face to face either amerigo or charlotte had pressed and how little she herself was in danger of doing so maggie scarce needed to remember that her father wouldn t by the tip of a toe of that she was equally conscious the only thing was that since he didn t she could but hold her breath for what he would do instead when at the end of three minutes more he had said with an effect of suddenness well mag and the principino it was quite as if that were by contrast the hard the truer voice she glanced at the clock i ordered him for half past five which hasn t yet struck trust him my dear not to fail you oh i don t want him to fail me was mr verver s reply yet uttered in so explicitly jocose a relation to the possibilities of failure that even when just afterwards he wandered in his impatience to one of the long windows and passed out to the balcony she asked herself but for a few seconds if reality should she follow him would overtake or meet her there she followed him of necessity it came absolutely so near to his inviting her by stepping off into temporary detachment to give the others something of the chance that she and her husband had so fantastically discussed beside him then while they hung over the great dull place clear and almost coloured now coloured with the odd sad pictured old fashioned look that empty london streets take on in waning afternoons of the summer s end she felt once more how impossible such a passage would have been to them how it would have torn them to pieces if they had so much as suffered its suppressed relations to peep out of their eyes this danger would doubtless indeed have been more to be reckoned with if the instinct of each she could certainly at least answer for her own had not so successfully acted to trump up other apparent connexions for it connexions as to which they could pretend to be frank you mustn t stay on here you know adam verver said as a result of his unobstructed outlook fawns is all there for you of course to the end of my tenure but fawns so dismantled he added with mild ruefulness fawns with half its contents and half its best things removed won t seem to you i m afraid particularly lively no maggie answered we should miss its best things its best things my dear have certainly been removed to be back there she went on to be back there and she paused for the force of her idea oh to be back there without anything good but she didn t hesitate now she brought her idea forth to be back there without charlotte is more than i think would do and as she smiled at him with it so she saw him the next instant take it take it in a way that helped her smile to pass all for an allusion to what she didn t and couldn t say this quantity was too clear that she couldn t at such an hour be pretending to name to him what it was as he would have said going to be at fawns or anywhere else to want for him that was now and in a manner exaltedly sublimely out of their compass and their question so that what was she doing while they waited for the principino while they left the others together and their tension just sensibly threatened what was she doing but just offer a bold but substantial substitute nothing was stranger moreover under the action of charlotte s presence than the fact of a felt sincerity in her words she felt her sincerity absolutely sound she gave it for all it might mean because charlotte dear you know she said is incomparable it took thirty seconds but she was to know when these were over that she had pronounced one of the happiest words of her life they had turned from the view of the street they leaned together against the balcony rail with the room largely in sight from where they stood but with the prince and mrs verver out of range nothing he could try she immediately saw was to keep his eyes from lighting not even his taking out his cigarette case and saying before he said anything else may i smoke she met it for encouragement with her my dear again and then while he struck his match she had just another minute to be nervous a minute that she made use of however not in the least to falter but to reiterate with a high ring a ring that might for all she cared reach the pair inside father father charlotte s great it was not till after he had begun to smoke that he looked at her charlotte s great they could close upon it such a basis as they might immediately feel it make and so they stood together over it quite gratefully each recording to the other s eyes that it was firm under their feet they had even thus a renewed wait as for proof of it much as if he were letting her see while the minutes lapsed for their concealed companions that this was finally just why but just why you see he presently added how right i was right i mean to do it for you ah rather she murmured with her smile and then as to be herself ideally right i don t see what you would have done without her the point was he returned quietly that i didn t see what you were to do yet it was a risk it was a risk said maggie but i believed in it at least for myself she smiled well now he smoked we see we see i know her better you know her best oh but naturally on which as the warranted truth of it hung in the air the truth warranted as who should say exactly by the present opportunity to pronounce this opportunity created and accepted she found herself lost though with a finer thrill than she had perhaps yet known in the vision of all he might mean the sense of it in her rose higher rose with each moment that he invited her thus to see him linger and when after a little more he had said smoking again and looking up with head thrown back and hands spread on the balcony rail at the grey gaunt front of the house she s beautiful beautiful her sensibility reported to her the shade of a new note it was all she might have wished for it was with a kind of speaking competence the note of possession and control and yet it conveyed to her as nothing till now had done the reality of their parting they were parting in the light of it absolutely on charlotte s value the value that was filling the room out of which they had stepped as if to give it play and with which the prince on his side was perhaps making larger acquaintance if maggie had desired at so late an hour some last conclusive comfortable category to place him in for dismissal she might have found it here in its all coming back to his ability to rest upon high values somehow when all was said and with the memory of her gifts her variety her power so much remained of charlotte s what else had she herself meant three minutes before by speaking of her as great great for the world that was before her that he proposed she should be she was not to be wasted in the application of his plan maggie held to this then that she wasn t to be wasted to let his daughter know it he had sought this brief privacy what a blessing accordingly that she could speak her joy in it his face meanwhile at all events was turned to her and as she met his eyes again her joy went straight it s success father it s success and even this he added as the principino appearing alone deep within piped across an instant greeting even this isn t altogether failure they went in to receive the boy upon whose introduction to the room by miss bogle charlotte and the prince got up seemingly with an impressiveness that had caused miss bogle not to give further effect to her own entrance she had retired but the principino s presence by itself sufficiently broke the tension the subsidence of which in the great room ten minutes later gave to the air something of the quality produced by the cessation of a sustained rattle stillness when the prince and princess returned from attending the visitors to their carriage might have been said to be not so much restored as created so that whatever next took place in it was foredoomed to remarkable salience that would have been the case even with so natural though so futile a movement as maggie s going out to the balcony again to follow with her eyes her father s departure the carriage was out of sight it had taken her too long solemnly to reascend and she looked awhile only at the great grey space on which as on the room still more the shadow of dusk had fallen here at first her husband had not rejoined her he had come up with the boy who clutching his hand abounded as usual in remarks worthy of the family archives but the two appeared then to have proceeded to report to miss bogle it meant something for the princess that her husband had thus got their son out of the way not bringing him back to his mother but everything now as she vaguely moved about struck her as meaning so much that the unheard chorus swelled yet this above all her just being there as she was and waiting for him to come in their freedom to be together there always was the meaning most disengaged she stood in the cool twilight and took in all about her where it lurked her reason for what she had done she knew at last really why and how she had been inspired and guided how she had been persistently able how to her soul all the while it had been for the sake of this end here it was then the moment the golden fruit that had shone from afar only what were these things in the fact for the hand and for the lips when tested when tasted what were they as a reward closer than she had ever been to the measure of her course and the full face of her act she had an instant of the terror that when there has been suspense always precedes on the part of the creature to be paid the certification of the amount amerigo knew it the amount he still held it and the delay in his return making her heart beat too fast to go on was like a sudden blinding light on a wild speculation she had thrown the dice but his hand was over her cast he opened the door however at last he hadn t been away ten minutes and then with her sight of him renewed to intensity she seemed to have a view of the number his presence alone as he paused to look at her somehow made it the highest and even before he had spoken she had begun to be paid in full with that consciousness in fact an extraordinary thing occurred the assurance of her safety so making her terror drop that already within the minute it had been changed to concern for his own anxiety for everything that was deep in his being and everything that was fair in his face so far as seeing that she was paid went he might have been holding out the money bag for her to come and take it but what instantly rose for her between the act and her acceptance was the sense that she must strike him as waiting for a confession this in turn charged her with a new horror if that was her proper payment she would go without money his acknowledgment hung there too monstrously at the expense of charlotte before whose mastery of the greater style she had just been standing dazzled all she now knew accordingly was that she should be ashamed to listen to the uttered word all that is but that she might dispose of it on the spot forever isn t she too splendid she simply said offering it to explain and to finish oh splendid with which he came over to her that s our help you see she added to point further her moral it kept him before her therefore taking in or trying to what she so wonderfully gave he tried too clearly to please her to meet her in her own way but with the result only that close to her her face kept before him his hands holding her shoulders his whole act enclosing her he presently echoed see i see nothing but you and the truth of it had with this force after a moment so strangely lighted his eyes that as for pity and dread of them she buried her own in his breast glasses by henry james chapter i yes indeed i say to myself pen in hand i can keep hold of the thread and let it lead me back to the first impression the little story is all there i can touch it from point to point for the thread as i call it is a row of coloured beads on a string none of the beads are missing at least i think they re not that s exactly what i shall amuse myself with finding out i had been all summer working hard in town and then had gone down to folkestone for a blow art was long i felt and my holiday short my mother was settled at folkestone and i paid her a visit when i could i remember how on this occasion after weeks in my stuffy studio with my nose on my palette i sniffed up the clean salt air and cooled my eyes with the purple sea the place was full of lodgings and the lodgings were at that season full of people people who had nothing to do but to stare at one another on the great flat down there were thousands of little chairs and almost as many little jews and there was music in an open rotunda over which the little jews wagged their big noses we all strolled to and fro and took pennyworths of rest the long level cliff top edged in places with its iron rail might have been the deck of a huge crowded ship there were old folks in bath chairs and there was one dear chair creeping to its last full stop by the side of which i always walked there was in fine weather the coast of france to look at and there were the usual things to say about it there was also in every state of the atmosphere our friend mrs meldrum a subject of remark not less inveterate the widow of an officer in the engineers she had settled like many members of the martial miscellany well within sight of the hereditary enemy who however had left her leisure to form in spite of the difference of their years a close alliance with my mother she was the heartiest the keenest the ugliest of women the least apologetic the least morbid in her misfortune she carried it high aloft with loud sounds and free gestures made it flutter in the breeze as if it had been the flag of her country it consisted mainly of a big red face indescribably out of drawing from which she glared at you through gold rimmed aids to vision optic circles of such diameter and so frequently displaced that some one had vividly spoken of her as flattering her nose against the glass of her spectacles she was extraordinarily near sighted and whatever they did to other objects they magnified immensely the kind eyes behind them blest conveniences they were in their hideous honest strength they showed the good lady everything in the world but her own queerness this element was enhanced by wild braveries of dress reckless charges of colour and stubborn resistances of cut wondrous encounters in which the art of the toilet seemed to lay down its life she had the tread of a grenadier and the voice of an angel in the course of a walk with her the day after my arrival i found myself grabbing her arm with sudden and undue familiarity i had been struck by the beauty of a face that approached us and i was still more affected when i saw the face at the sight of my companion open like a window thrown wide a smile fluttered out of it an brightly as a drapery dropped from a sill a drapery shaken there in the sun by a young lady flanked by two young men a wonderful young lady who as we drew nearer rushed up to mrs meldrum with arms flourished for an embrace my immediate impression of her had been that she was dressed in mourning but during the few moments she stood talking with our friend i made more discoveries the figure from the neck down was meagre the stature insignificant but the desire to please towered high as well as the air of infallibly knowing how and of never never missing it this was a little person whom i would have made a high bid for a good chance to paint the head the features the colour the whole facial oval and radiance had a wonderful purity the deep grey eyes the most agreeable i thought that i had ever seen brushed with a kind of winglike grace every object they encountered their possessor was just back from boulogne where she had spent a week with dear mrs floyd taylor this accounted for the effusiveness of her reunion with dear mrs meldrum her black garments were of the freshest and daintiest she suggested a pink and white wreath at a showy funeral she confounded us for three minutes with her presence she was a beauty of the great conscious public responsible order the young men her companions gazed at her and grinned i could see there were very few moments of the day at which young men these or others would not be so occupied the people who approached took leave of their manners every one seemed to linger and gape when she brought her face close to mrs meldrum s and she appeared to be always bringing it close to somebody s it was a marvel that objects so dissimilar should express the same general identity the unmistakable character of the english gentlewoman mrs meldrum sustained the comparison with her usual courage but i wondered why she didn t introduce me i should have had no objection to the bringing of such a face close to mine however by the time the young lady moved on with her escort she herself bequeathed me a sense that some such rapprochement might still occur was this by reason of the general frequency of encounters at folkestone or by reason of a subtle acknowledgment that she contrived to make of the rights on the part of others that such beauty as hers created i was in a position to answer that question after mrs meldrum had answered a few of mine chapter ii flora saunt the only daughter of an old soldier had lost both her parents her mother within a few months mrs meldrum had known them disapproved of them considerably avoided them she had watched the girl off and on from her early childhood flora just twenty was extraordinarily alone in the world so alone that she had no natural chaperon no one to stay with but a mercenary stranger mrs hammond synge the sister in law of one of the young men i had just seen she had lots of friends but none of them nice she kept picking up impossible people the floyd taylors with whom she had been at boulogne were simply horrid the hammond synges were perhaps not so vulgar but they had no conscience in their dealings with her she knows what i think of them said mrs meldrum and indeed she knows what i think of most things she shares that privilege with most of your friends i replied laughing no doubt but possibly to some of my friends it makes a little difference that girl doesn t care a button she knows best of all what i think of flora saunt and what may your opinion be why that she s not worth troubling about an idiot too abysmal doesn t she care for that just enough as you saw to hug me till i cry out she s too pleased with herself for anything else to matter surely my dear friend i rejoined she has a good deal to be pleased with so every one tells her and so you would have told her if i had given you the chance however that doesn t signify either for her vanity is beyond all making or mending she believes in herself and she s welcome after all poor dear having only herself to look to i ve seldom met a young woman more completely free to be silly she has a clear course she ll make a showy finish well i replied as she probably will reduce many persons to the same degraded state her partaking of it won t stand out so much if you mean that the world s full of twaddlers i quite agree with you cried mrs meldrum trumpeting her laugh half across the channel i had after this to consider a little what she would call my mother s son but i didn t let it prevent me from insisting on her making me acquainted with flora saunt indeed i took the bull by the horns urging that she had drawn the portrait of a nature which common charity now demanded of her to put into relation with a character really fine such a frail creature was just an object of pity this contention on my part had at first of course been jocular but strange to say it was quite the ground i found myself taking with regard to our young lady after i had begun to know her i couldn t have said what i felt about her except that she was undefended from the first of my sitting with her there after dinner under the stars that was a week at folkestone of balmy nights and muffled tides and crowded chairs i became aware both that protection was wholly absent from her life and that she was wholly indifferent to its absence the odd thing was that she was not appealing she was abjectly divinely conceited absurdly fantastically pleased her beauty was as yet all the world to her a world she had plenty to do to live in mrs meldrum told me more about her and there was nothing that as the centre of a group of giggling nudging spectators flora wasn t ready to tell about herself she held her little court in the crowd upon the grass playing her light over jews and gentiles completely at ease in all promiscuities it was an effect of these things that from the very first with every one listening i could mention that my main business with her would be just to have a go at her head and to arrange in that view for an early sitting it would have been as impossible i think to be impertinent to her as it would have been to throw a stone at a plate glass window so any talk that went forward on the basis of her loveliness was the most natural thing in the world and immediately became the most general and sociable it was when i saw all this that i judged how though it was the last thing she asked for what one would ever most have at her service was a curious compassion that sentiment was coloured by the vision of the dire exposure of a being whom vanity had put so off her guard hers was the only vanity i have ever known that made its possessor superlatively soft mrs meldrum s further information contributed moreover to these indulgences her account of the girl s neglected childhood and queer continental relegations with straying squabbling monte carlo haunting parents the more invidious picture above all of her pecuniary arrangement still in force with the hammond synges who really though they never took her out practically she went out alone had their hands half the time in her pocket she had to pay for everything down to her share of the wine bills and the horses fodder down to bertie hammond synge s fare in the underground when he went to the city for her she had been left with just money enough to turn her head and it hadn t even been put in trust nothing prudent or proper had been done with it she could spend her capital and at the rate she was going expensive extravagant and with a swarm of parasites to help it certainly wouldn t last very long couldn t you perhaps take her independent unencumbered as you are i asked of mrs meldrum you re probably with one exception the sanest person she knows and you at least wouldn t scandalously fleece her how do you know what i wouldn t do my humorous friend demanded of course i ve thought how i can help her it has kept me awake at night but doing it s impossible she ll take nothing from me you know what she does she hugs me and runs away she has an instinct about me and feels that i ve one about her and then she dislikes me for another reason that i m not quite clear about but that i m well aware of and that i shall find out some day so far as her settling with me goes it would be impossible moreover here she wants naturally enough a much wider field she must live in london her game is there so she takes the line of adoring me of saying she can never forget that i was devoted to her mother which i wouldn t for the world have been and of giving me a wide berth i think she positively dislikes to look at me it s all right there s no obligation though people in general can t take their eyes off me i see that at this moment i replied but what does it matter where or how for the present she lives she ll marry infallibly marry early and everything then will change whom will she marry my companion gloomily asked any one she likes she s so abnormally pretty that she can do anything she ll fascinate some nabob or some prince she ll fascinate him first and bore him afterwards moreover she s not so pretty as you make her out she hasn t a scrap of a figure no doubt but one doesn t in the least miss it not now said mrs meldrum but one will when she s older and when everything will have to count when she s older she ll count as a princess so it won t matter she has other drawbacks my companion went on those wonderful eyes are good for nothing but to roll about like sugar balls which they greatly resemble in a child s mouth she can t use them use them why she does nothing else to make fools of young men but not to read or write not to do any sort of work she never opens a book and her maid writes her notes you ll say that those who live in glass houses shouldn t throw stones of course i know that if i didn t wear my goggles i shouldn t be good for much do you mean that miss saunt ought to sport such things i exclaimed with more horror than i meant to show i don t prescribe for her i don t know that they re what she requires what s the matter with her eyes i asked after a moment i don t exactly know but i heard from her mother years ago that even as a child they had had for a while to put her into spectacles and that though she hated them and had been in a fury of disgust she would always have to be extremely careful i m sure i hope she is i echoed the hope but i remember well the impression this made upon me my immediate pang of resentment a disgust almost equal to flora s own i felt as if a great rare sapphire had split in my hand chapter iii this conversation occurred the night before i went back to town i settled on the morrow to take a late train so that i had still my morning to spend at folkestone where during the greater part of it i was out with my mother every one in the place was as usual out with some one else and even had i been free to go and take leave of her i should have been sure that flora saunt would not be at home just where she was i presently discovered she was at the far end of the cliff the point at which it overhangs the pretty view of sandgate and hythe her back however was turned to this attraction it rested with the aid of her elbows thrust slightly behind her so that her scanty little shoulders were raised toward her ears on the high rail that inclosed the down two gentlemen stood before her whose faces we couldn t see but who even as observed from the rear were visibly absorbed in the charming figure piece submitted to them i was freshly struck with the fact that this meagre and defective little person with the cock of her hat and the flutter of her crape with her eternal idleness her eternal happiness her absence of moods and mysteries and the pretty presentation of her feet which especially now in the supported slope of her posture occupied with their imperceptibility so much of the foreground i was reminded anew i say how our young lady dazzled by some art that the enumeration of her merits didn t explain and that the mention of her lapses didn t affect where she was amiss nothing counted and where she was right everything did i say she was wanting in mystery but that after all was her secret this happened to be my first chance of introducing her to my mother who had not much left in life but the quiet look from under the hood of her chair at the things which when she should have quitted those she loved she could still trust to make the world good for them i wondered an instant how much she might be moved to trust flora saunt and then while the chair stood still and she waited i went over and asked the girl to come and speak to her in this way i saw that if one of flora s attendants was the inevitable young hammond synge master of ceremonies of her regular court always offering the use of a telescope and accepting that of a cigar the other was a personage i had not yet encountered a small pale youth in showy knickerbockers whose eyebrows and nose and the glued points of whose little moustache were extraordinarily uplifted and sustained i remember taking him at first for a foreigner and for something of a pretender i scarce know why unless because of the motive i felt in the stare he fixed on me when i asked miss saunt to come away he struck me a little as a young man practising the social art of impertinence but it didn t matter for flora came away with alacrity bringing all her prettiness and pleasure and gliding over the grass in that rustle of delicate mourning which made the endless variety of her garments as a painter could take heed strike one always as the same obscure elegance she seated herself on the floor of my mother s chair a little too much on her right instep as i afterwards gathered caressing her still hand smiling up into her cold face commending and approving her without a reserve and without a doubt she told her immediately as if it were something for her to hold on by that she was soon to sit to me for a likeness and these words gave me a chance to enquire if it would be the fate of the picture should i finish it to be presented to the young man in the knickerbockers her lips at this parted in a stare her eyes darkened to the purple of one of the shadow patches on the sea she showed for the passing instant the face of some splendid tragic mask and i remembered for the inconsequence of it what mrs meldrum had said about her sight i had derived from this lady a worrying impulse to catechise her but that didn t seem exactly kind so i substituted another question inquiring who the pretty young man in knickerbockers might happen to be oh a gentleman i met at boulogne he has come over to see me after a moment she added lord iffield i had never heard of lord iffield but her mention of his having been at boulogne helped me to give him a niche mrs meldrum had incidentally thrown a certain light on the manners of mrs floyd taylor flora s recent hostess in that charming town a lady who it appeared had a special vocation for helping rich young men to find a use for their leisure she had always one or other in hand and had apparently on this occasion pointed her lesson at the rare creature on the opposite coast i had a vague idea that boulogne was not a resort of the world s envied at the same time there might very well have been a strong attraction there even for one of the darlings of fortune i could perfectly understand in any case that such a darling should be drawn to folkestone by flora saunt but it was not in truth of these things i was thinking what was uppermost in my mind was a matter which though it had no sort of keeping insisted just then on coming out is it true miss saunt i suddenly demanded that you re so unfortunate as to have had some warning about your beautiful eyes i was startled by the effect of my words the girl threw back her head changing colour from brow to chin true who in the world says so i repented of my question in a flash the way she met it made it seem cruel and i felt my mother look at me in some surprise i took care in answer to flora s challenge not to incriminate mrs meldrum i answered that the rumour had reached me only in the vaguest form and that if i had been moved to put it to the test my very real interest in her must be held responsible her blush died away but a pair of still prettier tears glistened in its track if you ever hear such a thing said again you can say it s a horrid lie i had brought on a commotion deeper than any i was prepared for but it was explained in some degree by the next words she uttered i m happy to say there s nothing the matter with any part of me whatever not the least little thing she spoke with her habitual complacency with triumphant assurance she smiled again and i could see how she wished that she hadn t so taken me up she turned it off with a laugh i ve good eyes good teeth a good digestion and a good temper i m sound of wind and limb nothing could have been more characteristic than her blush and her tears nothing less acceptable to her than to be thought not perfect in every particular she couldn t submit to the imputation of a flaw i expressed my delight in what she told me assuring her i should always do battle for her and as if to rejoin her companions she got up from her place on my mother s toes the young men presented their backs to us they were leaning on the rail of the cliff our incident had produced a certain awkwardness and while i was thinking of what next to say she exclaimed irrelevantly don t you know he ll be lord considine at that moment the youth marked for this high destiny turned round and she spoke to my mother i ll introduce him to you he s awfully nice she beckoned and invited him with her parasol the movement struck me as taking everything for granted i had heard of lord considine and if i had not been able to place lord iffield it was because i didn t know the name of his eldest son the young man took no notice of miss saunt s appeal he only stared a moment and then on her repeating it quietly turned his back she was an odd creature she didn t blush at this she only said to my mother apologetically but with the frankest sweetest amusement you don t mind do you he s a monster of shyness it was as if she were sorry for every one for lord iffield the victim of a complaint so painful and for my mother the subject of a certain slight i m sure i don t want him said my mother but flora added some promise of how she would handle him for his rudeness she would clearly never explain anything by any failure of her own appeal there rolled over me while she took leave of us and floated back to her friends a wave of superstitious dread i seemed somehow to see her go forth to her fate and yet what should fill out this orb of a high destiny if not such beauty and such joy i had a dim idea that lord considine was a great proprietor and though there mingled with it a faint impression that i shouldn t like his son the result of the two images was a whimsical prayer that the girl mightn t miss her possible fortune chapter iv one day in the course of the following june there was ushered into my studio a gentleman whom i had not yet seen but with whom i had been very briefly in correspondence a letter from him had expressed to me some days before his regret on learning that my splendid portrait of miss flora louisa saunt whose full name figured by her own wish in the catalogue of the exhibition of the academy had found a purchaser before the close of the private view he took the liberty of inquiring whether i might have at his service some other memorial of the same lovely head some preliminary sketch some study for the picture i had replied that i had indeed painted miss saunt more than once and that if he were interested in my work i should be happy to show him what i had done mr geoffrey dawling the person thus introduced to me stumbled into my room with awkward movements and equivocal sounds a long lean confused confusing young man with a bad complexion and large protrusive teeth he bore in its most indelible pressure the postmark as it were of oxford and as soon as he opened his mouth i perceived in addition to a remarkable revelation of gums that the text of the queer communication matched the registered envelope he was full of refinements and angles of dreary and distinguished knowledge of his unconscious drollery his dress freely partook it seemed from the gold ring into which his red necktie was passed to the square toe caps of his boots to conform with a high sense of modernness to the fashion before the last there were moments when his overdone urbanity all suggestive stammers and interrogative quavers made him scarcely intelligible but i felt him to be a gentleman and i liked the honesty of his errand and the expression of his good green eyes as a worshipper at the shrine of beauty however he needed explaining especially when i found he had no acquaintance with my brilliant model had on the mere evidence of my picture taken as he said a tremendous fancy to her looks i ought doubtless to have been humiliated by the simplicity of his judgment of them a judgment for which the rendering was lost in the subject quite leaving out the element of art he was like the innocent reader for whom the story is really true and the author a negligible quantity he had come to me only because he wanted to purchase and i remember being so amused at his attitude which i had never seen equally marked in a person of education that i asked him why for the sort of enjoyment he desired it wouldn t be more to the point to deal directly with the lady he stared and blushed at this the idea clearly alarmed him he was an extraordinary case personally so modest that i could see it had never occurred to him he had fallen in love with a painted sign and seemed content just to dream of what it stood for he was the young prince in the legend or the comedy who loses his heart to the miniature of the princess beyond seas until i knew him better this puzzled me much the link was so missing between his sensibility and his type he was of course bewildered by my sketches which implied in the beholder some sense of intention and quality but for one of them a comparative failure he ended by conceiving a preference so arbitrary and so lively that taking no second look at the others he expressed his wish to possess it and fell into the extremity of confusion over the question of price i helped him over that stile and he went off without having asked me a direct question about miss saunt yet with his acquisition under his arm his delicacy was such that he evidently considered his rights to be limited he had acquired none at all in regard to the original of the picture there were others for i was curious about him that i wanted him to feel i conceded i should have been glad of his carrying away a sense of ground acquired for coming back to ensure this i had probably only to invite him and i perfectly recall the impulse that made me forbear it operated suddenly from within while he hung about the door and in spite of the diffident appeal that blinked in his gentle grin if he was smitten with flora s ghost what mightn t be the direct force of the luminary that could cast such a shadow this source of radiance flooding my poor place might very well happen to be present the next time he should turn up the idea was sharp within me that there were relations and complications it was no mission of mine to bring about if they were to develop they should develop in their very own sense let me say at once that they did develop and that i perhaps after all had something to do with it if mr dawling had departed without a fresh appointment he was to reappear six months later under protection no less powerful than that of our young lady herself i had seen her repeatedly for months she had grown to regard my studio as the temple of her beauty this miracle was recorded and celebrated there as nowhere else in other places there was occasional reference to other subjects of remark the degree of her presumption continued to be stupefying there was nothing so extraordinary save the degree in which she never paid for it she was kept innocent that is she was kept safe by her egotism but she was helped also though she had now put off her mourning by the attitude of the lone orphan who had to be a law unto herself it was as a lone orphan that she came and went as a lone orphan that she was the centre of a crush the neglect of the hammond synges gave relief to this character and she made it worth their while to be as every one said too shocking lord iffield had gone to india to shoot tigers but he returned in time for the punctual private view it was he who had snapped up as flora called it the gem of the exhibition my hope for the girl s future had slipped ignominiously off his back but after his purchase of the portrait i tried to cultivate a new faith the girl s own faith was wonderful it couldn t however be contagious too great was the limit of her sense of what painters call values her colours were laid on like blankets on a cold night how indeed could a person speak the truth who was always posturing and bragging she was after all vulgar enough and by the time i had mastered her profile and could almost with my eyes shut do it in a single line i was decidedly tired of its purity which affected me at last as inane one moved with her moreover among phenomena mismated and unrelated nothing in her talk ever matched anything out of it lord iffield was dying of love for her but his family was leading him a life his mother horrid woman had told some one that she would rather he should be swallowed by a tiger than marry a girl not absolutely one of themselves he had given his young friend unmistakable signs but was lying low gaining time it was in his father s power to be both in personal and in pecuniary ways excessively nasty to him his father wouldn t last for ever quite the contrary and he knew how thoroughly in spite of her youth her beauty and the swarm of her admirers some of them positively threatening in their passion he could trust her to hold out there were richer cleverer men there were greater personages too but she liked her little viscount just as he was and liked to think that bullied and persecuted he had her there so gratefully to rest upon she came back to me with tale upon tale and it all might be or mightn t i never met my pretty model in the world she moved it appeared in exalted circles and could only admire in her wealth of illustration the grandeur of her life and the freedom of her hand i had on the first opportunity spoken to her of geoffrey dawling and she had listened to my story so far as she had the art of such patience asking me indeed more questions about him than i could answer then she had capped my anecdote with others much more striking the disclosure of effects produced in the most extraordinary quarters on people who had followed her into railway carriages guards and porters even who had literally stuck there others who had spoken to her in shops and hung about her house door cabmen upon her honour in london who to gaze their fill at her had found excuses to thrust their petrifaction through the very glasses of four wheelers she lost herself in these reminiscences the moral of which was that poor mr dawling was only one of a million when therefore the next autumn she flourished into my studio with her odd companion at her heels her first care was to make clear to me that if he was now in servitude it wasn t because she had run after him dawling explained with a hundred grins that when one wished very much to get anything one usually ended by doing so a proposition which led me wholly to dissent and our young lady to asseverate that she hadn t in the least wished to get mr dawling she mightn t have wished to get him but she wished to show him and i seemed to read that if she could treat him as a trophy her affairs were rather at the ebb true there always hung from her belt a promiscuous fringe of scalps much at any rate would have come and gone since our separation in july she had spent four months abroad where on swiss and italian lakes in german cities in the french capital many accidents might have happened chapter v i had been again with my mother but except mrs meldrum and the gleam of france had not found at folkestone my old resources and pastimes mrs meldrum much edified by my report of the performances as she called them in my studio had told me that to her knowledge flora would soon be on the straw she had cut from her capital such fine fat slices that there was almost nothing more left to swallow perched on her breezy cliff the good lady dazzled me as usual by her universal light she knew so much more about everything and everybody than i could ever squeeze out of my colour tubes she knew that flora was acting on system and absolutely declined to be interfered with her precious reasoning was that her money would last as long as she should need it that a magnificent marriage would crown her charms before she should be really pinched she had a sum put by for a liberal outfit meanwhile the proper use of the rest was to decorate her for the approaches to the altar keep her afloat in the society in which she would most naturally meet her match lord iffield had been seen with her at lucerne at cadenabbia but it was mrs meldrum s conviction that nothing was to be expected of him but the most futile flirtation the girl had a certain hold of him but with a great deal of swagger he hadn t the spirit of a sheep he was in fear of his father and would never commit himself in lord considine s lifetime the most flora might achieve was that he wouldn t marry some one else geoffrey dawling to mrs meldrum s knowledge i had told her of the young man s visit had attached himself on the way back from italy to the hammond synge group my informant was in a position to be definite about this dangler she knew about his people she had heard of him before hadn t he been a friend of one of her nephews at oxford hadn t he spent the christmas holidays precisely three years before at her brother in law s in yorkshire taking that occasion to get himself refused with derision by wilful betty the second daughter of the house her sister who liked the floundering youth had written to her to complain of betty and that the young man should now turn up as an appendage of flora s was one of those oft cited proofs that the world is small and that there are not enough people to go round his father had been something or other in the treasury his grandfather on the mother s side had been something or other in the church he had come into the paternal estate two or three thousand a year in hampshire but he had let the place advantageously and was generous to four plain sisters who lived at bournemouth and adored him the family was hideous all round but the very salt of the earth he was supposed to be unspeakably clever he was fond of london fond of books of intellectual society and of the idea of a political career that such a man should be at the same time fond of flora saunt attested as the phrase in the first volume of gibbon has it the variety of his inclinations i was soon to learn that he was fonder of her than of all the other things together betty one of five and with views above her station was at any rate felt at home to have dished herself by her perversity of course no one had looked at her since and no one would ever look at her again it would be eminently desirable that flora should learn the lesson of betty s fate i was not struck i confess with all this in my mind by any symptom on our young lady s part of that sort of meditation the one moral she saw in anything was that of her incomparable aspect which mr dawling smitten even like the railway porters and the cabmen by the doom dealing gods had followed from london to venice and from venice back to london again i afterwards learned that her version of this episode was profusely inexact his personal acquaintance with her had been determined by an accident remarkable enough i admit in connexion with what had gone before a coincidence at all events superficially striking at munich returning from a tour in the tyrol with two of his sisters he had found himself at the table d hote of his inn opposite to the full presentment of that face of which the mere clumsy copy had made him dream and desire he had been tossed by it to a height so vertiginous as to involve a retreat from the board but the next day he had dropped with a resounding thud at the very feet of his apparition on the following with an equal incoherence a sacrifice even of his bewildered sisters whom he left behind he made an heroic effort to escape by flight from a fate of which he had already felt the cold breath that fate in london very little later drove him straight before it drove him one sunday afternoon in the rain to the door of the hammond synges he marched in other words close up to the cannon that was to blow him to pieces but three weeks when he reappeared to me had elapsed since then yet to vary my metaphor the burden he was to carry for the rest of his days was firmly lashed to his back i don t mean by this that flora had been persuaded to contract her scope i mean that he had been treated to the unconditional snub which as the event was to show couldn t have been bettered as a means of securing him she hadn t calculated but she had said never and that word had made a bed big enough for his long legged patience he became from this moment to my mind the interesting figure in the piece now that he had acted without my aid i was free to show him this and having on his own side something to show me he repeatedly knocked at my door what he brought with him on these occasions was a simplicity so huge that as i turn my ear to the past i seem even now to hear it bumping up and down my stairs that was really what i saw of him in the light of his behaviour he had fallen in love as he might have broken his leg and the fracture was of a sort that would make him permanently lame it was the whole man who limped and lurched with nothing of him left in the same position as before the tremendous cleverness the literary society the political ambition the bournemouth sisters all seemed to flop with his every movement a little nearer to the floor i hadn t had an oxford training and i had never encountered the great man at whose feet poor dawling had most submissively sat and who had addressed him his most destructive sniffs but i remember asking myself how effectively this privilege had supposed itself to prepare him for the career on which my friend appeared now to have embarked i remember too making up my mind about the cleverness which had its uses and i suppose in impenetrable shades even its critics but from which the friction of mere personal intercourse was not the sort of process to extract a revealing spark he accepted without a question both his fever and his chill and the only thing he touched with judgment was this convenience of my friendship he doubtless told me his simple story but the matter comes back in a kind of sense of my being rather the mouthpiece of my having had to put it together for him he took it from me in this form without a groan and i gave it him quite as it came he took it again and again spending his odd half hours with me as if for the very purpose of learning how idiotically he was in love he told me i made him see things to begin with hadn t i first made him see flora saunt i wanted him to give her up and lucidly informed him why on which he never protested nor contradicted never was even so alembicated as to declare just for the sake of the point that he wouldn t he simply and pointlessly didn t and when at the end of three months i asked him what was the use of talking with such a fellow his nearest approach to a justification was to say that what made him want to help her was just the deficiencies i dwelt on i could only reply without gross developments oh if you re as sorry for her as that i too was nearly as sorry for her as that but it only led me to be sorrier still for other victims of this compassion with dawling as with me the compassion was at first in excess of any visible motive so that when eventually the motive was supplied each could to a certain extent compliment the other on the fineness of his foresight after he had begun to haunt my studio miss saunt quite gave it up and i finally learned that she accused me of conspiring with him to put pressure on her to marry him she didn t know i would take it that way else she would never have brought him to see me it was in her view a part of the conspiracy that to show him a kindness i asked him at last to sit to me i dare say moreover she was disgusted to hear that i had ended by attempting almost as many sketches of his beauty as i had attempted of hers what was the value of tributes to beauty by a hand that could so abase itself my relation to poor dawling s want of modelling was simple enough i was really digging in that sandy desert for the buried treasure of his soul chapter vi it befell at this period just before christmas that on my having gone under pressure of the season into a great shop to buy a toy or two my eyes fleeing from superfluity lighted at a distance on the bright concretion of flora saunt an exhibitability that held its own even against the most plausible pinkness of the most developed dolls a huge quarter of the place the biggest bazaar on earth was peopled with these and other effigies and fantasies as well as with purchasers and vendors haggard alike in the blaze of the gas with hesitations i was just about to appeal to flora to avert that stage of my errand when i saw that she was accompanied by a gentleman whose identity though more than a year had elapsed came back to me from the folkestone cliff it had been associated on that scene with showy knickerbockers at present it overflowed more splendidly into a fur trimmed overcoat lord iffield s presence made me waver an instant before crossing over and during that instant flora blank and undistinguishing as if she too were after all weary of alternatives looked straight across at me i was on the point of raising my hat to her when i observed that her face gave no sign i was exactly in the line of her vision but she either didn t see me or didn t recognise me or else had a reason to pretend she didn t was her reason that i had displeased her and that she wished to punish me i had always thought it one of her merits that she wasn t vindictive she at any rate simply looked away and at this moment one of the shop girls who had apparently gone off in search of it bustled up to her with a small mechanical toy it so happened that i followed closely what then took place afterwards recognising that i had been led to do so led even through the crowd to press nearer for the purpose by an impression of which in the act i was not fully conscious flora with the toy in her hand looked round at her companion then seeing his attention had been solicited in another quarter she moved away with the shop girl who had evidently offered to conduct her into the presence of more objects of the same sort when she reached the indicated spot i was in a position still to observe her she had asked some question about the working of the toy and the girl taking it herself began to explain the little secret flora bent her head over it but she clearly didn t understand i saw her in a manner that quickened my curiosity give a glance back at the place from which she had come lord iffield was talking with another young person she satisfied herself of this by the aid of a question addressed to her own attendant she then drew closer to the table near which she stood and turning her back to me bent her head lower over the collection of toys and more particularly over the small object the girl had attempted to explain she took it again and after a moment with her face well averted made an odd motion of her arms and a significant little duck of her head these slight signs singular as it may appear produced in my bosom an agitation so great that i failed to notice lord iffield s whereabouts he had rejoined her he was close upon her before i knew it or before she knew it herself i felt at that instant the strangest of all promptings if it could have operated more rapidly it would have caused me to dash between them in some such manner as to give flora a caution in fact as it was i think i could have done this in time had i not been checked by a curiosity stronger still than my impulse there were three seconds during which i saw the young man and yet let him come on didn t i make the quick calculation that if he didn t catch what flora was doing i too might perhaps not catch it she at any rate herself took the alarm on perceiving her companion s nearness she made still averted another duck of her head and a shuffle of her hands so precipitate that a little tin steamboat she had been holding escaped from them and rattled down to the floor with a sharpness that i hear at this hour lord iffield had already seized her arm with a violent jerk he brought her round toward him then it was that there met my eyes a quite distressing sight this exquisite creature blushing glaring exposed with a pair of big black rimmed eye glasses defacing her by their position crookedly astride of her beautiful nose she made a grab at them with her free hand while i turned confusedly away chapter vii i don t remember how soon it was i spoke to geoffrey dawling his sittings were irregular but it was certainly the very next time he gave me one has any rumour ever reached you of miss saunt s having anything the matter with her eyes he stared with a candour that was a sufficient answer to my question backing it up with a shocked and mystified never then i asked him if he had observed in her any symptom however disguised of embarrassed sight on which after a moment s thought he exclaimed disguised as if my use of that word had vaguely awakened a train she s not a bit myopic he said she doesn t blink or contract her lids i fully recognised this and i mentioned that she altogether denied the impeachment owing it to him moreover to explain the ground of my inquiry i gave him a sketch of the incident that had taken place before me at the shop he knew all about lord iffield that nobleman had figured freely in our conversation as his preferred his injurious rival poor dawling s contention was that if there had been a definite engagement between his lordship and the young lady the sort of thing that was announced in the morning post renunciation and retirement would be comparatively easy to him but that having waited in vain for any such assurance he was entitled to act as if the door were not really closed or were at any rate not cruelly locked he was naturally much struck with my anecdote and still more with my interpretation of it there is something there is something possibly something very grave certainly something that requires she should make use of artificial aids she won t admit it publicly because with her idolatry of her beauty the feeling she is all made up of she sees in such aids nothing but the humiliation and the disfigurement she has used them in secret but that is evidently not enough for the affection she suffers from apparently some definite menace has lately grown much worse she looked straight at me in the shop which was violently lighted without seeing it was i at the same distance at folkestone where as you know i first met her where i heard this mystery hinted at and where she indignantly denied the thing she appeared easily enough to recognise people at present she couldn t really make out anything the shop girl showed her she has successfully concealed from the man i saw her with that she resorts in private to a pince nez and that she does so not only under the strictest orders from her oculist but because literally the poor thing can t accomplish without such help half the business of life iffield however has suspected something and his suspicions whether expressed or kept to himself have put him on the watch i happened to have a glimpse of the movement at which he pounced on her and caught her in the act i had thought it all out my idea explained many things and dawling turned pale as he listened to me was he rough with her he anxiously asked how can i tell what passed between them i fled from the place my companion stared do you mean to say her eyesight s going heaven forbid in that case how could she take life as she does how does she take life that s the question he sat there bewilderedly brooding the tears rose to his lids they reminded me of those i had seen in flora s the day i risked my enquiry the question he had asked was one that to my own satisfaction i was ready to answer but i hesitated to let him hear as yet all that my reflections had suggested i was indeed privately astonished at their ingenuity for the present i only rejoined that it struck me she was playing a particular game at which he went on as if he hadn t heard me suddenly haunted with a fear lost in the dark possibility do you mean there s a danger of anything very bad my dear fellow you must ask her special adviser who in the world is her special adviser i haven t a conception but we mustn t get too excited my impression would be that she has only to observe a few ordinary rules to exercise a little common sense dawling jumped at this i see to stick to the pince nez to follow to the letter her oculist s prescription whatever it is and at whatever cost to her prettiness it s not a thing to be trifled with upon my honour it shan t be he roundly declared and he adjusted himself to his position again as if we had quite settled the business after a considerable interval while i botched away he suddenly said did they make a great difference a great difference those things she had put on oh the glasses in her beauty she looked queer of course but it was partly because one was unaccustomed there are women who look charming in nippers what at any rate if she does look queer she must be mad not to accept that alternative she is mad said geoffrey dawling mad to refuse you i grant besides i went on the pince nez which was a large and peculiar one was all awry she had half pulled it off but it continued to stick and she was crimson she was angry it must have been horrible my companion groaned it was horrible but it s still more horrible to defy all warnings it s still more horrible to be landed in without saying in what i disgustedly shrugged my shoulders after a glance at me dawling jerked round then you do believe that she may be i hesitated the thing would be to make her believe it she only needs a good scare but if that fellow is shocked at the precautions she does take oh who knows i rejoined with small sincerity i don t suppose iffield is absolutely a brute i would take her with leather blinders like a shying mare cried geoffrey dawling i had an impression that iffield wouldn t but i didn t communicate it for i wanted to pacify my friend whom i had discomposed too much for the purposes of my sitting i recollect that i did some good work that morning but it also comes back to me that before we separated he had practically revealed to me that my anecdote connecting itself in his mind with a series of observations at the time unconscious and unregistered had covered with light the subject of our colloquy he had had a formless perception of some secret that drove miss saunt to subterfuges and the more he thought of it the more he guessed this secret to be the practice of making believe she saw when she didn t and of cleverly keeping people from finding out how little she saw when one pieced things together it was astonishing what ground they covered just as he was going away he asked me from what source at folkestone the horrid tale had proceeded when i had given him as i saw no reason not to do the name of mrs meldrum he exclaimed oh i know all about her she s a friend of some friends of mine at this i remembered wilful betty and said to myself that i knew some one who would probably prove more wilful still chapter viii a few days later i again heard dawling on my stairs and even before he passed my threshold i knew he had something to tell i ve been down to folkestone it was necessary i should see her i forget whether he had come straight from the station he was at any rate out of breath with his news which it took me however a minute to apply you mean that you ve been with mrs meldrum yes to ask her what she knows and how she comes to know it it worked upon me awfully i mean what you told me he made a visible effort to seem quieter than he was and it showed me sufficiently that he had not been reassured i laid to comfort him and smiling at a venture a friendly hand on his arm and he dropped into my eyes fixing them an instant a strange distended look which might have expressed the cold clearness of all that was to come i know now he said with an emphasis he rarely used what then did mrs meldrum tell you only one thing that signified for she has no real knowledge but that one thing was everything what is it then why that she can t bear the sight of her his pronouns required some arranging but after i had successfully dealt with them i replied that i was quite aware of miss saunt s trick of turning her back on the good lady of folkestone only what did that prove have you never guessed i guessed as soon as she spoke dawling towered over me in dismal triumph it was the first time in our acquaintance that on any ground of understanding this had occurred but even so remarkable an incident still left me sufficiently at sea to cause him to continue why the effect of those spectacles i seemed to catch the tail of his idea mrs meldrum s they re so awfully ugly and they add so to the dear woman s ugliness this remark began to flash a light and when he quickly added she sees herself she sees her own fate my response was so immediate that i had almost taken the words out of his mouth while i tried to fix this sudden image of flora s face glazed in and cross barred even as mrs meldrum s was glazed and barred he went on to assert that only the horror of that image looming out at herself could be the reason of her avoiding the person who so forced it home the fact he had encountered made everything hideously vivid and more vivid than anything else that just such another pair of goggles was what would have been prescribed to flora i see i see i presently returned what would become of lord iffield if she were suddenly to come out in them what indeed would become of every one what would become of everything this was an enquiry that dawling was evidently unprepared to meet and i completed it by saying at last my dear fellow for that matter what would become of you once more he turned on me his good green eyes oh i shouldn t mind the tone of his words somehow made his ugly face beautiful and i discovered at this moment how much i really liked him none the less at the same time perversely and rudely i felt the droll side of our discussion of such alternatives it made me laugh out and say to him while i laughed you d take her even with those things of mrs meldrum s he remained mournfully grave i could see that he was surprised at my rude mirth but he summoned back a vision of the lady at folkestone and conscientiously replied even with those things of mrs meldrum s i begged him not to resent my laughter which but exposed the fact that we had built a monstrous castle in the air didn t he see on what flimsy ground the structure rested the evidence was preposterously small he believed the worst but we were really uninformed i shall find out the truth he promptly replied how can you if you question her you ll simply drive her to perjure herself wherein after all does it concern you to know the truth it s the girl s own affair then why did you tell me your story i was a trifle embarrassed to warn you off i smiled he took no more notice of these words than presently to remark that lord iffield had no serious intentions very possibly i said but you mustn t speak as if lord iffield and you were her only alternatives dawling thought a moment couldn t something be got out of the people she has consulted she must have been to people how else can she have been condemned condemned to what condemned to perpetual nippers of course she has consulted some of the big specialists but she has done it you may be sure in the most clandestine manner and even if it were supposable that they would tell you anything which i altogether doubt you would have great difficulty in finding out which men they are therefore leave it alone never show her what you suspect i even before he quitted me asked him to promise me this all right i promise but he was gloomy enough he was a lover facing the fact that there was no limit to the deceit his loved one was ready to practise it made so remarkably little difference i could see by what a stretch his passionate pity would from this moment overlook the girl s fatuity and folly she was always accessible to him that i knew for if she had told him he was an idiot to dream she could dream of him she would have rebuked the imputation of having failed to make it clear that she would always be glad to regard him as a friend what were most of her friends what were all of them but repudiated idiots i was perfectly aware that in her conversations and confidences i myself for instance had a niche in the gallery as regards poor dawling i knew how often he still called on the hammond synges it was not there but under the wing of the floyd taylors that her intimacy with lord iffield most flourished at all events when a week after the visit i have just summarised flora s name was one morning brought up to me i jumped at the conclusion that dawling had been with her and even i fear briefly entertained the thought that he had broken his word chapter ix she left me after she had been introduced in no suspense about her present motive she was on the contrary in a visible fever to enlighten me but i promptly learned that for the alarm with which she pitiably panted our young man was not accountable she had but one thought in the world and that thought was for lord iffield i had the strangest saddest scene with her and if it did me no other good it at least made me at last completely understand why insidiously from the first she had struck me as a creature of tragedy in showing me the whole of her folly it lifted the curtain of her misery i don t know how much she meant to tell me when she came i think she had had plans of elaborate misrepresentation at any rate she found it at the end of ten minutes the simplest way to break down and sob to be wretched and true when she had once begun to let herself go the movement took her off her feet the relief of it was like the cessation of a cramp she shared in a word her long secret she shifted her sharp pain she brought i confess tears to my own eyes tears of helpless tenderness for her helpless poverty her visit however was not quite so memorable in itself as in some of its consequences the most immediate of which was that i went that afternoon to see geoffrey dawling who had in those days rooms in welbeck street where i presented myself at an hour late enough to warrant the supposition that he might have come in he had not come in but he was expected and i was invited to enter and wait for him a lady i was informed was already in his sitting room i hesitated a little at a loss it had wildly coursed through my brain that the lady was perhaps flora saunt but when i asked if she were young and remarkably pretty i received so significant a no sir that i risked an advance and after a minute in this manner found myself to my astonishment face to face with mrs meldrum oh you dear thing she exclaimed i m delighted to see you you spare me another compromising demarche but for this i should have called on you also know the worst at once if you see me here it s at least deliberate it s planned plotted shameless i came up on purpose to see him upon my word i m in love with him why if you valued my peace of mind did you let him the other day at folkestone dawn upon my delighted eyes i found myself there in half an hour simply infatuated with him with a perfect sense of everything that can be urged against him i hold him none the less the very pearl of men however i haven t come up to declare my passion i ve come to bring him news that will interest him much more above all i ve come to urge upon him to be careful about flora saunt about what he says and does he must be as still as a mouse she s at last really engaged but it s a tremendous secret i was moved to mirth precisely she wired me this noon and spent another shilling to tell me that not a creature in the world is yet to know it she had better have spent it to tell you that she had just passed an hour with the creature you see before you she has just passed an hour with every one in the place mrs meldrum cried they ve vital reasons she says for it s not coming out for a month then it will be formally announced but meanwhile her rejoicing is wild i daresay mr dawling already knows and as it s nearly seven o clock may have jumped off london bridge but an effect of the talk i had with him the other day was to make me on receipt of my telegram feel it to be my duty to warn him in person against taking action so to call it on the horrid certitude which i could see he carried away with him i had added somehow to that certitude he told me what you had told him you had seen in your shop mrs meldrum i perceived had come to welbeck street on an errand identical with my own a circumstance indicating her rare sagacity inasmuch as her ground for undertaking it was a very different thing from what flora s wonderful visit had made of mine i remarked to her that what i had seen in the shop was sufficiently striking but that i had seen a great deal more that morning in my studio in short i said i ve seen everything she was mystified everything the poor creature is under the darkest of clouds oh she came to triumph but she remained to talk something in the nature of sense she put herself completely in my hands she does me the honour to intimate that of all her friends i m the most disinterested after she had announced to me that lord iffield was utterly committed to her and that for the present i was absolutely the only person in the secret she arrived at her real business she had had a suspicion of me ever since that day at folkestone when i asked her for the truth about her eyes the truth is what you and i both guessed she s in very bad danger but from what cause i who by god s mercy have kept mine know everything that can be known about eyes said mrs meldrum she might have kept hers if she had profited by god s mercy if she had done in time done years ago what was imperatively ordered her if she hadn t in fine been cursed with the loveliness that was to make her behaviour a thing of fable she may still keep her sight or what remains of it if she ll sacrifice and after all so little that purely superficial charm she must do as you ve done she must wear dear lady what you wear what my companion wore glittered for the moment like a melon frame in august heaven forgive her now i understand she flushed for dismay but i wasn t afraid of the effect on her good nature of her thus seeing through her great goggles why it had always been that flora held her at such a distance i can t tell you i said from what special affection what state of the eye her danger proceeds that s the one thing she succeeded this morning in keeping from me she knows it herself perfectly she has had the best advice in europe it s a thing that s awful simply awful that was the only account she would give me year before last while she was at boulogne she went for three days with mrs floyd taylor to paris she there surreptitiously consulted the greatest man even mrs floyd taylor doesn t know last autumn in germany she did the same first put on certain special spectacles with a straight bar in the middle then we ll talk that s practically what they say what she says is that she ll put on anything in nature when she s married but that she must get married first she has always meant to do everything as soon as she s married then and then only she ll be safe how will any one ever look at her if she makes herself a fright how could she ever have got engaged if she had made herself a fright from the first it s no use to insist that with her beauty she can never be a fright she said to me this morning poor girl the most characteristic the most harrowing things my face is all i have and such a face i knew from the first i could do anything with it but i needed it all i need it still every exquisite inch of it it isn t as if i had a figure or anything else oh if god had only given me a figure too i don t say yes with a figure a really good one like fanny floyd taylor s who s hideous i d have risked plain glasses que voulez vous no one is perfect she says she still has money left but i don t believe a word of it she has been speculating on her impunity on the idea that her danger would hold off she has literally been running a race with it her theory has been as you from the first so clearly saw that she d get in ahead she swears to me that though the bar is too cruel she wears when she s alone what she has been ordered to wear but when the deuce is she alone it s herself of course that she has swindled worst she has put herself off so insanely that even her conceit but half accounts for it with little inadequate concessions little false measures and preposterous evasions and childish hopes her great terror is now that iffield who already has suspicions who has found out her pince nez but whom she has beguiled with some unblushing hocus pocus may discover the dreadful facts and the essence of what she wanted this morning was in that interest to square me to get me to deny indignantly and authoritatively for isn t she my favourite sitter that she has anything in life the matter with any part of her she sobbed she went on she entreated after we got talking her extraordinary nerve left her and she showed me what she has been through showed me also all her terror of the harm i could do her wait till i m married wait till i m married she took hold of me she almost sank on her knees it seems to me highly immoral one s participation in her fraud but there s no doubt that she must be married i don t know what i don t see behind it therefore i wound up dawling must keep his hands off mrs meldrum had held her breath she gave out a long moan well that s exactly what i came here to tell him then here he is our host all unprepared his latchkey still in his hand had just pushed open the door and startled at finding us turned a frightened look from one to the other wondering what disaster we were there to announce or avert mrs meldrum was on the spot all gaiety i ve come to return your sweet visit ah she laughed i mean to keep up the acquaintance do do he murmured mechanically and absently continuing to look at us then he broke out he s going to marry her i was surprised you already know he produced an evening paper which he tossed down on the table it s in that published already i was still more surprised oh flora can t keep a secret mrs meldrum made it light she went up to poor dawling and laid a motherly hand upon him it s all right it s just as it ought to be don t think about her ever any more then as he met this adjuration with a stare from which thought and of the most defiant and dismal fairly protruded the excellent woman put up her funny face and tenderly kissed him on the cheek chapter x i have spoken of these reminiscences as of a row of coloured beads and i confess that as i continue to straighten out my chaplet i am rather proud of the comparison the beads are all there as i said they slip along the string in their small smooth roundness geoffrey dawling accepted as a gentleman the event his evening paper had proclaimed in view of which i snatched a moment to nudge him a hint that he might offer mrs meldrum his hand he returned me a heavy head shake and i judged that marriage would henceforth strike him very much as the traffic of the street may strike some poor incurable at the window of an hospital circumstances arising at this time led to my making an absence from england and circumstances already existing offered him a firm basis for similar action he had after all the usual resource of a briton he could take to his boats always drawn up in our background he started on a journey round the globe and i was left with nothing but my inference as to what might have happened later observation however only confirmed my belief that if at any time during the couple of months after flora saunt s brilliant engagement he had made up as they say to the good lady of folkestone that good lady would not have pushed him over the cliff strange as she was to behold i knew of cases in which she had been obliged to administer that shove i went to new york to paint a couple of portraits but i found once on the spot that i had counted without chicago where i was invited to blot out this harsh discrimination by the production of some dozen i spent a year in america and should probably have spent a second had i not been summoned back to england by alarming news from my mother her strength had failed and as soon as i reached london i hurried down to folkestone arriving just at the moment to offer a welcome to some slight symptom of a rally she had been much worse but was now a little better and though i found nothing but satisfaction in having come to her i saw after a few hours that my london studio where arrears of work had already met me would be my place to await whatever might next occur yet before returning to town i called on mrs meldrum from whom i had not had a line and my view of whom with the adjacent objects as i had left them had been intercepted by a luxuriant foreground before i had gained her house i met her as i supposed coming toward me across the down greeting me from afar with the familiar twinkle of her great vitreous badge and as it was late in the autumn and the esplanade a blank i was free to acknowledge this signal by cutting a caper on the grass my enthusiasm dropped indeed the next moment for i had seen in a few more seconds that the person thus assaulted had by no means the figure of my military friend i felt a shock much greater than any i should have thought possible when on this person s drawing near i knew her for poor little flora saunt at what moment she had recognised me belonged to an order of mysteries over which it quickly came home to me one would never linger again once we were face to face it so chiefly mattered that i should succeed in looking entirely unastonished all i at first saw was the big gold bar crossing each of her lenses over which something convex and grotesque like the eyes of a large insect something that now represented her whole personality seemed as out of the orifice of a prison to strain forward and press the face had shrunk away it looked smaller appeared even to look plain it was at all events so far as the effect on a spectator was concerned wholly sacrificed to this huge apparatus of sight there was no smile in it and she made no motion to take my offered hand i had no idea you were down here i said and i wondered whether she didn t know me at all or knew me only by my voice you thought i was mrs meldrum she ever so quietly answered it was just this low pitch that made me protest with laughter oh yes you have a tremendous deal in common with mrs meldrum i ve just returned to england after a long absence and i m on my way to see her won t you come with me it struck me that her old reason for keeping clear of our friend was well disposed of now i ve just left her i m staying with her she stood solemnly fixing me with her goggles would you like to paint me now she asked she seemed to speak with intense gravity from behind a mask or a cage there was nothing to do but treat the question still with high spirits it would be a fascinating little artistic problem that something was wrong it wasn t difficult to see but a good deal more than met the eye might be presumed to be wrong if flora was under mrs meldrum s roof i hadn t for a year had much time to think of her but my imagination had had ground for lodging her in more gilded halls one of the last things i had heard before leaving england was that in commemoration of the new relationship she had gone to stay with lady considine this had made me take everything else for granted and the noisy american world had deafened my care to possible contradictions her spectacles were at present a direct contradiction they seemed a negation not only of new relationships but of every old one as well i remember nevertheless that when after a moment she walked beside me on the grass i found myself nervously hoping she wouldn t as yet at any rate tell me anything very dreadful so that to stave off this danger i harried her with questions about mrs meldrum and without waiting for replies became profuse on the subject of my own doings my companion was finely silent and i felt both as if she were watching my nervousness with a sort of sinister irony and as if i were talking to some different and strange person flora plain and obscure and dumb was no flora at all at mrs meldrum s door she turned off with the observation that as there was certainly a great deal i should have to say to our friend she had better not go in with me i looked at her again i had been keeping my eyes away from her but only to meet her magnified stare i greatly desired in truth to see mrs meldrum alone but there was something so grim in the girl s trouble that i hesitated to fall in with this idea of dropping her yet one couldn t express a compassion without seeming to take for granted more trouble than there actually might have been i reflected that i must really figure to her as a fool which was an entertainment i had never expected to give her it rolled over me there for the first time it has come back to me since that there is wondrously in very deep and even in very foolish misfortune a dignity still finer than in the most inveterate habit of being all right i couldn t have to her the manner of treating it as a mere detail that i was face to face with a part of what at our last meeting we had had such a scene about but while i was trying to think of some manner that i could have she said quite colourlessly though somehow as if she might never see me again good bye i m going to take my walk all alone she looked round the great bleak cliff top with whom should i go besides i like to be alone for the present this gave me the glimmer of a vision that she regarded her disfigurement as temporary and the confidence came to me that she would never for her happiness cease to be a creature of illusions it enabled me to exclaim smiling brightly and feeling indeed idiotic oh i shall see you again but i hope you ll have a very pleasant walk all my walks are pleasant thank you they do me such a lot of good she was as quiet as a mouse and her words seemed to me stupendous in their wisdom i take several a day she continued she might have been an ancient woman responding with humility at the church door to the patronage of the parson the more i take the better i feel i m ordered by the doctors to keep all the while in the air and go in for plenty of exercise it keeps up my general health you know and if that goes on improving as it has lately done everything will soon be all right all that was the matter with me before and always it was too reckless was that i neglected my general health it acts directly on the state of the particular organ so i m going three miles i grinned at her from the doorstep while mrs meldrum s maid stood there to admit me oh i m so glad i said looking at her as she paced away with the pretty flutter she had kept and remembering the day when while she rejoined lord iffield i had indulged in the same observation her air of assurance was on this occasion not less than it had been on that but i recalled that she had then struck me as marching off to her doom was she really now marching away from it chapter xi as soon as i saw mrs meldrum i of course broke out is there anything in it is her general health mrs meldrum checked me with her great amused blare you ve already seen her and she has told you her wondrous tale what s in it is what has been in everything she has ever done the most comical tragical belief in herself she thinks she s doing a cure and what does her husband think her husband what husband hasn t she then married lord iffield vous en etes le cried my hostess why he behaved like a regular beast how should i know you never wrote me mrs meldrum hesitated covering me with what poor flora called the particular organ no i didn t write you i abstained on purpose if i kept quiet i thought you mightn t hear over there what had happened if you should hear i was afraid you would stir up mr dawling stir him up urge him to fly to the rescue write out to him that there was another chance for him i wouldn t have done it i said well mrs meldrum replied it was not my business to give you an opportunity in short you were afraid of it again she hesitated and though it may have been only my fancy i thought she considerably reddened at all events she laughed out then i was afraid of it she very honestly answered but doesn t he know has he given no sign every sign in life he came straight back to her he did everything to get her to listen to him but she hasn t the smallest idea of it has he seen her as she is now i presently and just a trifle awkwardly enquired indeed he has and borne it like a hero he told me all about it how much you ve all been through i found occasion to remark then what has become of him he s at home in hampshire he has got back his old place and i believe by this time his old sisters it s not half a bad little place yet its attractions say nothing to flora oh flora s by no means on her back my fried declared she s not on her back because she s on yours have you got her for the rest of your life once more mrs meldrum genially glared did she tell you how much the hammond synges have kindly left her to live on not quite eighty pounds a year that s a good deal but it won t pay the oculist what was it that at last induced her to submit to him her general collapse after that brute of an iffield s rupture she cried her eyes out she passed through a horror of black darkness then came a gleam of light and the light appears to have broadened she went into goggles as repentant magdalens go into the catholic church in spite of which you don t think she ll be saved she thinks she will that s all i can tell you there s no doubt that when once she brought herself to accept her real remedy as she calls it she began to enjoy a relief that she had never known that feeling very new and in spite of what she pays for it most refreshing has given her something to hold on by begotten in her foolish little mind a belief that as she says she s on the mend and that in the course of time if she leads a tremendously healthy life she ll be able to take off her muzzle and become as dangerous again as ever it keeps her going and what keeps you you re good until the parties begin again oh she doesn t object to me now smiled mrs meldrum i m going to take her abroad we shall be a pretty pair i was struck with this energy and after a moment i enquired the reason of it it s to divert her mind my friend replied reddening again a little i thought we shall go next week i ve only waited to see how your mother would be before starting i expressed to her hereupon my sense of her extraordinary merit and also that of the inconceivability of flora s fancying herself still in a situation not to jump at the chance of marrying a man like dawling she says he s too ugly she says he s too dreary she says in fact he s nobody mrs meldrum pursued she says above all that he s not her own sort she doesn t deny that he s good but she finds him impossibly ridiculous he s quite the last person she would ever dream of i was almost disposed on hearing this to protest that if the girl had so little proper feeling her noble suitor had perhaps served her right but after a while my curiosity as to just how her noble suitor had served her got the better of that emotion and i asked a question or two which led my companion again to apply to him the invidious term i have already quoted what had happened was simply that flora had at the eleventh hour broken down in the attempt to put him off with an uncandid account of her infirmity and that his lordship s interest in her had not been proof against the discovery of the way she had practised on him her dissimulation he was obliged to perceive had been infernally deep the future in short assumed a new complexion for him when looked at through the grim glasses of a bride who as he had said to some one couldn t really when you came to find out see her hand before her face he had conducted himself like any other jockeyed customer he had returned the animal as unsound he had backed out in his own way giving the business by some sharp shuffle such a turn as to make the rupture ostensibly flora s but he had none the less remorselessly and basely backed out he had cared for her lovely face cared for it in the amused and haunted way it had been her poor little delusive gift to make men care and her lovely face damn it with the monstrous gear she had begun to rig upon it was just what had let him in he had in the judgment of his family done everything that could be expected of him he had made mrs meldrum had herself seen the letter a handsome offer of pecuniary compensation oh if flora with her incredible buoyancy was in a manner on her feet again now it was not that she had not for weeks and weeks been prone in the dust strange were the humiliations the forms of anguish it was given some natures to survive that flora had survived was perhaps after all a proof she was reserved for some final mercy but she has been in the abysses at any rate said mrs meldrum and i really don t think i can tell you what pulled her through i think i can tell you i returned what in the world but mrs meldrum at the end of an hour flora had not come in and i was obliged to announce that i should have but time to reach the station where i was to find my luggage in charge of my mother s servant mrs meldrum put before me the question of waiting till a later train so as not to lose our young lady but i confess i gave this alternative a consideration less acute than i pretended somehow i didn t care if i did lose our young lady now that i knew the worst that had befallen her it struck me still less as possible to meet her on the ground of condolence and with the sad appearance she wore to me what other ground was left i lost her but i caught my train in truth she was so changed that one hated to see it and now that she was in charitable hands one didn t feel compelled to make great efforts i had studied her face for a particular beauty i had lived with that beauty and reproduced it but i knew what belonged to my trade well enough to be sure it was gone for ever chapter xii i was soon called back to folkestone but mrs meldrum and her young friend had already left england finding to that end every convenience on the spot and not having had to come up to town my thoughts however were so painfully engaged there that i should in any case have had little attention for them the event occurred that was to bring my series of visits to a close when this high tide had ebbed i returned to america and to my interrupted work which had opened out on such a scale that with a deep plunge into a great chance i was three good years in rising again to the surface there are nymphs and naiads moreover in the american depths they may have had something to do with the duration of my dive i mention them to account for a grave misdemeanor the fact that after the first year i rudely neglected mrs meldrum she had written to me from florence after my mother s death and had mentioned in a postscript that in our young lady s calculations the lowest figures were now italian counts this was a good omen and if in subsequent letters there was no news of a sequel i was content to accept small things and to believe that grave tidings should there be any would come to me in due course the gravity of what might happen to a featherweight became indeed with time and distance less appreciable and i was not without an impression that mrs meldrum whose sense of proportion was not the least of her merits had no idea of boring the world with the ups and downs of her pensioner the poor girl grew dusky and dim a small fitful memory a regret tempered by the comfortable consciousness of how kind mrs meldrum would always be to her i was professionally more preoccupied than i had ever been and i had swarms of pretty faces in my eyes and a chorus of loud tones in my ears geoffrey dawling had on his return to england written me two or three letters his last information had been that he was going into the figures of rural illiteracy i was delighted to receive it and had no doubt that if he should go into figures they would as they are said to be able to prove anything prove at least that my advice was sound and that he had wasted time enough this quickened on my part another hope a hope suggested by some roundabout rumour i forget how it reached me that he was engaged to a girl down in hampshire he turned out not to be but i felt sure that if only he went into figures deep enough he would become among the girls down in hampshire or elsewhere one of those numerous prizes of battle whose defences are practically not on the scale of their provocations i nursed in short the thought that it was probably open to him to develop as one of the types about whom as the years go on superficial critics wonder without relief how they ever succeeded in dragging a bride to the altar he never alluded to flora saunt and there was in his silence about her quite as in mrs meldrum s an element of instinctive tact a brief implication that if you didn t happen to have been in love with her there was nothing to be said within a week after my return to london i went to the opera of which i had always been much of a devotee i arrived too late for the first act of lohengrin but the second was just beginning and i gave myself up to it with no more than a glance at the house when it was over i treated myself with my glass from my place in the stalls to a general survey of the boxes making doubtless on their contents the reflections pointed by comparison that are most familiar to the wanderer restored to london there was the common sprinkling of pretty women but i suddenly noted that one of these was far prettier than the others this lady alone in one of the smaller receptacles of the grand tier and already the aim of fifty tentative glasses which she sustained with admirable serenity this single exquisite figure placed in the quarter furthest removed from my stall was a person i immediately felt to cause one s curiosity to linger dressed in white with diamonds in her hair and pearls on her neck she had a pale radiance of beauty which even at that distance made her a distinguished presence and with the air that easily attaches to lonely loveliness in public places an agreeable mystery a mystery however she remained to me only for a minute after i had levelled my glass at her i feel to this moment the startled thrill the shock almost of joy with which i translated her vague brightness into a resurrection of flora i say a resurrection because to put it crudely i had on that last occasion left our young woman for dead at present perfectly alive again she was altered only as it were by this fact of life a little older a little quieter a little finer and a good deal fairer she was simply transfigured by having recovered sustained by the reflection that even her recovery wouldn t enable her to distinguish me in the crowd i was free to look at her well then it was it came home to me that my vision of her in her great goggles had been cruelly final as her beauty was all there was of her that machinery had extinguished her and so far as i had thought of her in the interval i had thought of her as buried in the tomb her stern specialist had built with the sense that she had escaped from it came a lively wish to return to her and if i didn t straightway leave my place and rush round the theatre and up to her box it was because i was fixed to the spot some moments longer by the simple inability to cease looking at her she had been from the first of my seeing her practically motionless leaning back in her chair with a kind of thoughtful grace and with her eyes vaguely directed as it seemed on me to one of the boxes on my side of the house and consequently over my head and out of my sight the only movement she made for some time was to finger with an ungloved hand and as if with the habit of fondness the row of pearls on her neck which my glass showed me to be large and splendid her diamonds and pearls in her solitude mystified me making me as she had had no such brave jewels in the days of the hammond synges wonder what undreamt of improvement had taken place in her fortunes the ghost of a question hovered there a moment could anything so prodigious have happened as that on her tested and proved amendment lord iffield had taken her back this could scarce have without my hearing of it and moreover if she had become a person of such fashion where was the little court one would naturally see at her elbow her isolation was puzzling though it could easily suggest that she was but momentarily alone if she had come with mrs meldrum that lady would have taken advantage of the interval to pay a visit to some other box doubtless the box at which flora had just been looking mrs meldrum didn t account for the jewels but the revival of flora s beauty accounted for anything she presently moved her eyes over the house and i felt them brush me again like the wings of a dove i don t know what quick pleasure flickered into the hope that she would at last see me she did see me she suddenly bent forward to take up the little double barrelled ivory glass that rested on the edge of the box and to all appearance fix me with it i smiled from my place straight up at the searching lenses and after an instant she dropped them and smiled as straight back at me oh her smile it was her old smile her young smile her very own smile made perfect i instantly left my stall and hurried off for a nearer view of it quite flushed i remember as i went with the annoyance of having happened to think of the idiotic way i had tried to paint her poor iffield with his sample of that error and still poorer dawling in particular with his i hadn t touched her i was professionally humiliated and as the attendant in the lobby opened her box for me i felt that the very first thing i should have to say to her would be that she must absolutely sit to me again chapter xiii she gave me the smile once more as over her shoulder from her chair she turned her face to me here you are again she exclaimed with her disgloved hand put up a little backward for me to take i dropped into a chair just behind her and having taken it and noted that one of the curtains of the box would make the demonstration sufficiently private bent my lips over it and impressed them on its finger tips it was given me however to my astonishment to feel next that all the privacy in the world couldn t have sufficed to mitigate the start with which she greeted this free application of my moustache the blood had jumped to her face she quickly recovered her hand and jerked at me twisting herself round a vacant challenging stare during the next few instants several extraordinary things happened the first of which was that now i was close to them the eyes of loveliness i had come up to look into didn t show at all the conscious light i had just been pleased to see them flash across the house they showed on the contrary to my confusion a strange sweet blankness an expression i failed to give a meaning to until without delay i felt on my arm directed to it as if instantly to efface the effect of her start the grasp of the hand she had impulsively snatched from me it was the irrepressible question in this grasp that stopped on my lips all sound of salutation she had mistaken my entrance for that of another person a pair of lips without a moustache she was feeling me to see who i was with the perception of this and of her not seeing me i sat gaping at her and at the wild word that didn t come the right word to express or to disguise my dismay what was the right word to commemorate one s sudden discovery at the very moment too at which one had been most encouraged to count on better things that one s dear old friend had gone blind before the answer to this question dropped upon me and the moving moments though few seemed many i heard with the sound of voices the click of the attendant s key on the other side of the door poor flora heard also and on hearing still with her hand on my arm brightened again as i had a minute since seen her brighten across the house she had the sense of the return of the person she had taken me for the person with the right pair of lips as to whom i was for that matter much more in the dark than she i gasped but my word had come if she had lost her sight it was in this very loss that she had found again her beauty i managed to speak while we were still alone before her companion had appeared you re lovelier at this day than you have ever been in your life at the sound of my voice and that of the opening of the door her impatience broke into audible joy she sprang up recognising me always holding me and gleefully cried to a gentleman who was arrested in the doorway by the sight of me he has come back he has come back and you should have heard what he says of me the gentleman was geoffrey dawling and i thought it best to let him hear on the spot how beautiful she is my dear man but how extraordinarily beautiful more beautiful at this hour than ever ever before it gave them almost equal pleasure and made dawling blush to his eyes while this in turn produced in spite of deepened astonishment a blest snap of the strain i had been struggling with i wanted to embrace them both and while the opening bars of another scene rose from the orchestra i almost did embrace dawling whose first emotion on beholding me had visibly and ever so oddly been a consciousness of guilt i had caught him somehow in the act though that was as yet all i knew but by the time we sank noiselessly into our chairs again for the music was supreme wagner passed first my demonstration ought pretty well to have given him the limit of the criticism he had to fear i myself indeed while the opera blazed was only too afraid he might divine in our silent closeness the very moral of my optimism which was simply the comfort i had gathered from seeing that if our companion s beauty lived again her vanity partook of its life i had hit on the right note that was what eased me off it drew all pain for the next half hour from the sense of the deep darkness in which the stricken woman sat if the music in that darkness happily soared and swelled for her it beat its wings in unison with those of a gratified passion a great deal came and went between us without profaning the occasion so that i could feel at the end of twenty minutes as if i knew almost everything he might in kindness have to tell me knew even why flora while i stared at her from the stalls had misled me by the use of ivory and crystal and by appearing to recognise me and smile she leaned back in her chair in luxurious ease i had from the first become aware that the way she fingered her pearls was a sharp image of the wedded state nothing of old had seemed wanting to her assurance but i hadn t then dreamed of the art with which she would wear that assurance as a married woman she had taken him when everything had failed he had taken her when she herself had done so his embarrassed eyes confessed it all confessed the deep peace he found in it they only didn t tell me why he had not written to me nor clear up as yet a minor obscurity flora after a while again lifted the glass from the ledge of the box and elegantly swept the house with it then by the mere instinct of her grace a motion but half conscious she inclined her head into the void with the sketch of a salute producing i could see a perfect imitation of response to some homage dawling and i looked at each other again the tears came into his eyes she was playing at perfection still and her misfortune only simplified the process i recognised that this was as near as i should ever come certainly as i should come that night to pressing on her misfortune neither of us would name it more than we were doing then and flora would never name it at all little by little i saw that what had occurred was strange as it might appear the best thing for her happiness the question was now only of her beauty and her being seen and marvelled at with dawling to do for her everything in life her activity was limited to that such an activity was all within her scope it asked nothing of her that she couldn t splendidly give as from time to time in our delicate communion she turned her face to me with the parody of a look i lost none of the signs of its strange new glory the expression of the eyes was a rub of pastel from a master s thumb the whole head stamped with a sort of showy suffering had gained a fineness from what she had passed through yes flora was settled for life nothing could hurt her further i foresaw the particular praise she would mostly incur she would be invariably interesting she would charm with her pathos more even than she had charmed with her pleasure for herself above all she was fixed for ever rescued from all change and ransomed from all doubt her old certainties her old vanities were justified and sanctified and in the darkness that had closed upon her one object remained clear that object as unfading as a mosaic mask was fortunately the loveliest she could possibly look upon the greatest blessing of all was of course that dawling thought so her future was ruled with the straightest line and so for that matter was his there were two facts to which before i left my friends i gave time to sink into my spirit one was that he had changed by some process as effective as flora s change had been simplified somehow into service as she had been simplified into success he was such a picture of inspired intervention as i had never yet conceived he would exist henceforth for the sole purpose of rendering unnecessary or rather impossible any reference even on her own part to his wife s infirmity oh yes how little desire he would ever give me to refer to it he principally after a while made me feel and this was my second lesson that good natured as he was my being there to see it all oppressed him so that by the time the act ended i recognised that i too had filled out my hour dawling remembered things i think he caught in my very face the irony of old judgments they made him thresh about in his chair i said to flora as i took leave of her that i would come to see her but i may mention that i never went i d go to morrow if i hear she wants me but what in the world can she ever want as i quitted them i laid my hand on dawling s arm and drew him for a moment into the lobby why did you never write to me of your marriage he smiled uncomfortably showing his long yellow teeth and something more i don t know the whole thing gave me such a tremendous lot to do this was the first dishonest speech i had heard him make he really hadn t written because an idea that i would think him a still bigger fool than before i didn t insist but i tried there in the lobby so far as a pressure of his hand could serve me to give him a notion of what i thought him i can t at any rate make out i said why i didn t hear from mrs meldrum she didn t write to you never a word what has become of her i think she s at folkestone dawling returned but i m sorry to say that practically she has ceased to see us you haven t quarrelled with her how could we think of all we owe her at the time of our marriage and for months before she did everything for us i don t know how we should have managed without her but since then she has never been near us and has given us rather markedly little encouragement to keep up relations with her i was struck with this though of course i admit i am struck with all sorts of things well i said after a moment even if i could imagine a reason for that attitude it wouldn t explain why she shouldn t have taken account of my natural interest just so dawling s face was a windowless wall he could contribute nothing to the mystery and quitting him i carried it away it was not till i went down to ace mrs meldrum that was really dispelled she didn t want to hear of them or to talk of them not a bit and it was just in the same spirit that she hadn t wanted to write of them she had done everything in the world for them but now thank heaven the hard business was over after i had taken this in which i was quick to do we quite avoided the subject she simply couldn t bear it the golden bowl volume i henry james book first the prince part first i the prince had always liked his london when it had come to him he was one of the modern romans who find by the thames a more convincing image of the truth of the ancient state than any they have left by the tiber brought up on the legend of the city to which the world paid tribute he recognised in the present london much more than in contemporary rome the real dimensions of such a case if it was a question of an imperium he said to himself and if one wished as a roman to recover a little the sense of that the place to do so was on london bridge or even on a fine afternoon in may at hyde park corner it was not indeed to either of those places that these grounds of his predilection after all sufficiently vague had at the moment we are concerned with him guided his steps he had strayed simply enough into bond street where his imagination working at comparatively short range caused him now and then to stop before a window in which objects massive and lumpish in silver and gold in the forms to which precious stones contribute or in leather steel brass applied to a hundred uses and abuses were as tumbled together as if in the insolence of the empire they had been the loot of far off victories the young man s movements however betrayed no consistency of attention not even for that matter when one of his arrests had proceeded from possibilities in faces shaded as they passed him on the pavement by huge beribboned hats or more delicately tinted still under the tense silk of parasols held at perverse angles in waiting victorias and the prince s undirected thought was not a little symptomatic since though the turn of the season had come and the flush of the streets begun to fade the possibilities of faces on the august afternoon were still one of the notes of the scene he was too restless that was the fact for any concentration and the last idea that would just now have occurred to him in any connection was the idea of pursuit he had been pursuing for six months as never in his life before and what had actually unsteadied him as we join him was the sense of how he had been justified capture had crowned the pursuit or success as he would otherwise have put it had rewarded virtue whereby the consciousness of these things made him for the hour rather serious than gay a sobriety that might have consorted with failure sat in his handsome face constructively regular and grave yet at the same time oddly and as might be functionally almost radiant with its dark blue eyes its dark brown moustache and its expression no more sharply foreign to an english view than to have caused it sometimes to be observed of him with a shallow felicity that he looked like a refined irishman what had happened was that shortly before at three o clock his fate had practically been sealed and that even when one pretended to no quarrel with it the moment had something of the grimness of a crunched key in the strongest lock that could be made there was nothing to do as yet further but feel what one had done and our personage felt it while he aimlessly wandered it was already as if he were married so definitely had the solicitors at three o clock enabled the date to be fixed and by so few days was that date now distant he was to dine at half past eight o clock with the young lady on whose behalf and on whose father s the london lawyers had reached an inspired harmony with his own man of business poor calderoni fresh from rome and now apparently in the wondrous situation of being shown london before promptly leaving it again by mr verver himself mr verver whose easy way with his millions had taxed to such small purpose in the arrangements the principle of reciprocity the reciprocity with which the prince was during these minutes most struck was that of calderoni s bestowal of his company for a view of the lions if there was one thing in the world the young man at this juncture clearly intended it was to be much more decent as a son in law than lots of fellows he could think of had shown themselves in that character he thought of these fellows from whom he was so to differ in english he used mentally the english term to describe his difference for familiar with the tongue from his earliest years so that no note of strangeness remained with him either for lip or for ear he found it convenient in life for the greatest number of relations he found it convenient oddly even for his relation with himself though not unmindful that there might still as time went on be others including a more intimate degree of that one that would seek possibly with violence the larger or the finer issue which was it of the vernacular miss verver had told him he spoke english too well it was his only fault and he had not been able to speak worse even to oblige her when i speak worse you see i speak french he had said intimating thus that there were discriminations doubtless of the invidious kind for which that language was the most apt the girl had taken this she let him know as a reflection on her own french which she had always so dreamed of making good of making better to say nothing of his evident feeling that the idiom supposed a cleverness she was not a person to rise to the prince s answer to such remarks genial charming like every answer the parties to his new arrangement had yet had from him was that he was practising his american in order to converse properly on equal terms as it were with mr verver his prospective father in law had a command of it he said that put him at a disadvantage in any discussion besides which well besides which he had made to the girl the observation that positively of all his observations yet had most finely touched her you know i think he s a real galantuomo and no mistake there are plenty of sham ones about he seems to me simply the best man i ve ever seen in my life well my dear why shouldn t he be the girl had gaily inquired it was this precisely that had set the prince to think the things or many of them that had made mr verver what he was seemed practically to bring a charge of waste against the other things that with the other people known to the young man had failed of such a result why his form he had returned might have made one doubt father s form she hadn t seen it it strikes me he hasn t got any he hasn t got mine he hasn t even got yours thank you for even the girl had laughed at him oh yours my dear is tremendous but your father has his own i ve made that out so don t doubt it it s where it has brought him out that s the point it s his goodness that has brought him out our young woman had at this objected ah darling goodness i think never brought anyone out goodness when it s real precisely rather keeps people in he had been interested in his discrimination which amused him no it s his way it belongs to him but she had wondered still it s the american way that s all exactly it s all it s all i say it fits him so it must be good for something do you think it would be good for you maggie verver had smilingly asked to which his reply had been just of the happiest i don t feel my dear if you really want to know that anything much can now either hurt me or help me such as i am but you ll see for yourself say however i am a galantuomo which i devoutly hope i m like a chicken at best chopped up and smothered in sauce cooked down as a creme de volaille with half the parts left out your father s the natural fowl running about the bassecour his feathers movements his sounds those are the parts that with me are left out all as a matter of course since you can t eat a chicken alive the prince had not been annoyed at this but he had been positive well i m eating your father alive which is the only way to taste him i want to continue and as it s when he talks american that he is most alive so i must also cultivate it to get my pleasure he couldn t make one like him so much in any other language it mattered little that the girl had continued to demur it was the mere play of her joy i think he could make you like him in chinese it would be an unnecessary trouble what i mean is that he s a kind of result of his inevitable tone my liking is accordingly for the tone which has made him possible oh you ll hear enough of it she laughed before you ve done with us only this in truth had made him frown a little what do you mean please by my having done with you why found out about us all there is to find he had been able to take it indeed easily as a joke ah love i began with that i know enough i feel never to be surprised it s you yourselves meanwhile he continued who really know nothing there are two parts of me yes he had been moved to go on one is made up of the history the doings the marriages the crimes the follies the boundless betises of other people especially of their infamous waste of money that might have come to me those things are written literally in rows of volumes in libraries are as public as they re abominable everybody can get at them and you ve both of you wonderfully looked them in the face but there s another part very much smaller doubtless which such as it is represents my single self the unknown unimportant unimportant unimportant save to you personal quantity about this you ve found out nothing luckily my dear the girl had bravely said for what then would become please of the promised occupation of my future the young man remembered even now how extraordinarily clear he couldn t call it anything else she had looked in her prettiness as she had said it he also remembered what he had been moved to reply the happiest reigns we are taught you know are the reigns without any history oh i m not afraid of history she had been sure of that call it the bad part if you like yours certainly sticks out of you what was it else maggie verver had also said that made me originally think of you it wasn t as i should suppose you must have seen what you call your unknown quantity your particular self it was the generations behind you the follies and the crimes the plunder and the waste the wicked pope the monster most of all whom so many of the volumes in your family library are all about if i ve read but two or three yet i shall give myself up but the more as soon as i have time to the rest where therefore she had put it to him again without your archives annals infamies would you have been he recalled what to this he had gravely returned i might have been in a somewhat better pecuniary situation but his actual situation under the head in question positively so little mattered to them that having by that time lived deep into the sense of his advantage he had kept no impression of the girl s rejoinder it had but sweetened the waters in which he now floated tinted them as by the action of some essence poured from a gold topped phial for making one s bath aromatic no one before him never not even the infamous pope had so sat up to his neck in such a bath it showed for that matter how little one of his race could escape after all from history what was it but history and of their kind very much to have the assurance of the enjoyment of more money than the palace builder himself could have dreamed of this was the element that bore him up and into which maggie scattered on occasion her exquisite colouring drops they were of the colour of what on earth of what but the extraordinary american good faith they were of the colour of her innocence and yet at the same time of her imagination with which their relation his and these people s was all suffused what he had further said on the occasion of which we thus represent him as catching the echoes from his own thoughts while he loitered what he had further said came back to him for it had been the voice itself of his luck the soothing sound that was always with him you americans are almost incredibly romantic of course we are that s just what makes everything so nice for us everything he had wondered well everything that s nice at all the world the beautiful world or everything in it that is beautiful i mean we see so much he had looked at her a moment and he well knew how she had struck him in respect to the beautiful world as one of the beautiful the most beautiful things but what he had answered was you see too much that s what may sometimes make you difficulties when you don t at least he had amended with a further thought see too little but he had quite granted that he knew what she meant and his warning perhaps was needless he had seen the follies of the romantic disposition but there seemed somehow no follies in theirs nothing one was obliged to recognise but innocent pleasures pleasures without penalties their enjoyment was a tribute to others without being a loss to themselves only the funny thing he had respectfully submitted was that her father though older and wiser and a man into the bargain was as bad that is as good as herself oh he s better the girl had freely declared that is he s worse his relation to the things he cares for and i think it beautiful is absolutely romantic so is his whole life over here it s the most romantic thing i know you mean his idea for his native place yes the collection the museum with which he wishes to endow it and of which he thinks more as you know than of anything in the world it s the work of his life and the motive of everything he does the young man in his actual mood could have smiled again smiled delicately as he had then smiled at her has it been his motive in letting me have you yes my dear positively or in a manner she had said american city isn t by the way his native town for though he s not old it s a young thing compared with him a younger one he started there he has a feeling about it and the place has grown as he says like the programme of a charity performance you re at any rate a part of his collection she had explained one of the things that can only be got over here you re a rarity an object of beauty an object of price you re not perhaps absolutely unique but you re so curious and eminent that there are very few others like you you belong to a class about which everything is known you re what they call a morceau de musee i see i have the great sign of it he had risked that i cost a lot of money i haven t the least idea she had gravely answered what you cost and he had quite adored for the moment her way of saying it he had felt even for the moment vulgar but he had made the best of that wouldn t you find out if it were a question of parting with me my value would in that case be estimated she had looked at him with her charming eyes as if his value were well before her yes if you mean that i d pay rather than lose you and then there came again what this had made him say don t talk about me it s you who are not of this age you re a creature of a braver and finer one and the cinquecento at its most golden hour wouldn t have been ashamed of you it would of me and if i didn t know some of the pieces your father has acquired i should rather fear for american city the criticism of experts would it at all events be your idea he had then just ruefully asked to send me there for safety well we may have to come to it i ll go anywhere you want we must see first it will be only if we have to come to it there are things she had gone on that father puts away the bigger and more cumbrous of course which he stores has already stored in masses here and in paris in italy in spain in warehouses vaults banks safes wonderful secret places we ve been like a pair of pirates positively stage pirates the sort who wink at each other and say ha ha when they come to where their treasure is buried ours is buried pretty well everywhere except what we like to see what we travel with and have about us these the smaller pieces are the things we take out and arrange as we can to make the hotels we stay at and the houses we hire a little less ugly of course it s a danger and we have to keep watch but father loves a fine piece loves as he says the good of it and it s for the company of some of his things that he s willing to run his risks and we ve had extraordinary luck maggie had made that point we ve never lost anything yet and the finest objects are often the smallest values in lots of cases you must know have nothing to do with size but there s nothing however tiny she had wound up that we ve missed i like the class he had laughed for this in which you place me i shall be one of the little pieces that you unpack at the hotels or at the worst in the hired houses like this wonderful one and put out with the family photographs and the new magazines but it s something not to be so big that i have to be buried oh she had returned you shall not be buried my dear till you re dead unless indeed you call it burial to go to american city before i pronounce i should like to see my tomb so he had had after his fashion the last word in their interchange save for the result of an observation that had risen to his lips at the beginning which he had then checked and which now came back to him good bad or indifferent i hope there s one thing you believe about me he had sounded solemn even to himself but she had taken it gaily ah don t fix me down to one i believe things enough about you my dear to have a few left if most of them even go to smash i ve taken care of that i ve divided my faith into water tight compartments we must manage not to sink you do believe i m not a hypocrite you recognise that i don t lie or dissemble or deceive is that water tight the question to which he had given a certain intensity had made her he remembered stare an instant her colour rising as if it had sounded to her still stranger than he had intended he had perceived on the spot that any serious discussion of veracity of loyalty or rather of the want of them practically took her unprepared as if it were quite new to her he had noticed it before it was the english the american sign that duplicity like love had to be joked about it couldn t be gone into so the note of his inquiry was well to call it nothing else premature a mistake worth making however for the almost overdone drollery in which her answer instinctively sought refuge water tight the biggest compartment of all why it s the best cabin and the main deck and the engine room and the steward s pantry it s the ship itself it s the whole line it s the captain s table and all one s luggage one s reading for the trip she had images like that that were drawn from steamers and trains from a familiarity with lines a command of own cars from an experience of continents and seas that he was unable as yet to emulate from vast modern machineries and facilities whose acquaintance he had still to make but as to which it was part of the interest of his situation as it stood that he could quite without wincing feel his future likely to bristle with them it was in fact content as he was with his engagement and charming as he thought his affianced bride his view of that furniture that mainly constituted our young man s romance and to an extent that made of his inward state a contrast that he was intelligent enough to feel he was intelligent enough to feel quite humble to wish not to be in the least hard or voracious not to insist on his own side of the bargain to warn himself in short against arrogance and greed odd enough of a truth was his sense of this last danger which may illustrate moreover his general attitude toward dangers from within personally he considered he hadn t the vices in question and that was so much to the good his race on the other hand had had them handsomely enough and he was somehow full of his race its presence in him was like the consciousness of some inexpugnable scent in which his clothes his whole person his hands and the hair of his head might have been steeped as in some chemical bath the effect was nowhere in particular yet he constantly felt himself at the mercy of the cause he knew his antenatal history knew it in every detail and it was a thing to keep causes well before him what was his frank judgment of so much of its ugliness he asked himself but a part of the cultivation of humility what was this so important step he had just taken but the desire for some new history that should so far as possible contradict and even if need be flatly dishonour the old if what had come to him wouldn t do he must make something different he perfectly recognised always in his humility that the material for the making had to be mr verver s millions there was nothing else for him on earth to make it with he had tried before had had to look about and see the truth humble as he was at the same time he was not so humble as if he had known himself frivolous or stupid he had an idea which may amuse his historian that when you were stupid enough to be mistaken about such a matter you did know it therefore he wasn t mistaken his future might be might be scientific there was nothing in himself at all events to prevent it he was allying himself to science for it was science but the absence of prejudice backed by the presence of money his life would be full of machinery which was the antidote to superstition which was in its turn too much the consequence or at least the exhalation of archives he thought of these of his not being at all events futile and of his absolute acceptance of the developments of the coming age to redress the balance of his being so differently considered the moments when he most winced were those at which he found himself believing that really futility would have been forgiven him even with it in that absurd view he would have been good enough such was the laxity in the ververs of the romantic spirit they didn t indeed poor dears know what in that line the line of futility the real thing meant he did having seen it having tried it having taken its measure this was a memory in fact simply to screen out much as just in front of him while he walked the iron shutter of a shop closing early to the stale summer day rattled down at the turn of some crank there was machinery again just as the plate glass all about him was money was power the power of the rich peoples well he was of them now of the rich peoples he was on their side if it wasn t rather the pleasanter way of putting it that they were on his something of this sort was in any case the moral and the murmur of his walk it would have been ridiculous such a moral from such a source if it hadn t all somehow fitted to the gravity of the hour that gravity the oppression of which i began by recording another feature was the immediate nearness of the arrival of the contingent from home he was to meet them at charing cross on the morrow his younger brother who had married before him but whose wife of hebrew race with a portion that had gilded the pill was not in a condition to travel his sister and her husband the most anglicised of milanesi his maternal uncle the most shelved of diplomatists and his roman cousin don ottavio the most disponible of ex deputies and of relatives a scant handful of the consanguineous who in spite of maggie s plea for hymeneal reserve were to accompany him to the altar it was no great array yet it was apparently to be a more numerous muster than any possible to the bride herself having no wealth of kinship to choose from and making it up on the other hand by loose invitations he had been interested in the girl s attitude on the matter and had wholly deferred to it giving him as it did a glimpse distinctly pleasing of the kind of ruminations she would in general be governed by which were quite such as fell in with his own taste they hadn t natural relations she and her father she had explained so they wouldn t try to supply the place by artificial by make believe ones by any searching of highways and hedges oh yes they had acquaintances enough but a marriage was an intimate thing you asked acquaintances when you had your kith and kin you asked them over and above but you didn t ask them alone to cover your nudity and look like what they weren t she knew what she meant and what she liked and he was all ready to take from her finding a good omen in both of the facts he expected her desired her to have character his wife should have it and he wasn t afraid of her having much he had had in his earlier time to deal with plenty of people who had had it notably with the three four ecclesiastics his great uncle the cardinal above all who had taken a hand and played a part in his education the effect of all of which had never been to upset him he was thus fairly on the look out for the characteristic in this most intimate as she was to come of his associates he encouraged it when it appeared he felt therefore just at present as if his papers were in order as if his accounts so balanced as they had never done in his life before and he might close the portfolio with a snap it would open again doubtless of itself with the arrival of the romans it would even perhaps open with his dining to night in portland place where mr verver had pitched a tent suggesting that of alexander furnished with the spoils of darius but what meanwhile marked his crisis as i have said was his sense of the immediate two or three hours he paused on corners at crossings there kept rising for him in waves that consciousness sharp as to its source while vague as to its end which i began by speaking of the consciousness of an appeal to do something or other before it was too late for himself by any friend to whom he might have mentioned it the appeal could have been turned to frank derision for what for whom indeed but himself and the high advantages attached was he about to marry an extraordinarily charming girl whose prospects of the solid sort were as guaranteed as her amiability he wasn t to do it assuredly all for her the prince as happened however was so free to feel and yet not to formulate that there rose before him after a little definitely the image of a friend whom he had often found ironic he withheld the tribute of attention from passing faces only to let his impulse accumulate youth and beauty made him scarcely turn but the image of mrs assingham made him presently stop a hansom her youth her beauty were things more or less of the past but to find her at home as he possibly might would be doing what he still had time for would put something of a reason into his restlessness and thereby probably soothe it to recognise the propriety of this particular pilgrimage she lived far enough off in long cadogan place was already in fact to work it off a little a perception of the propriety of formally thanking her and of timing the act just as he happened to be doing this he made out as he went was obviously all that had been the matter with him it was true that he had mistaken the mood of the moment misread it rather superficially as an impulse to look the other way the other way from where his pledges had accumulated mrs assingham precisely represented embodied his pledges was in her pleasant person the force that had set them successively in motion she had made his marriage quite as truly as his papal ancestor had made his family though he could scarce see what she had made it for unless because she too was perversely romantic he had neither bribed nor persuaded her had given her nothing scarce even till now articulate thanks so that her profit to think of it vulgarly must have all had to come from the ververs yet he was far he could still remind himself from supposing that she had been grossly remunerated he was wholly sure she hadn t for if there were people who took presents and people who didn t she would be quite on the right side and of the proud class only then on the other hand her disinterestedness was rather awful it implied that is such abysses of confidence she was admirably attached to maggie whose possession of such a friend might moreover quite rank as one of her assets but the great proof of her affection had been in bringing them with her design together meeting him during a winter in rome meeting him afterwards in paris and liking him as she had in time frankly let him know from the first she had marked him for her young friend s own and had then unmistakably presented him in a light but the interest in maggie that was the point would have achieved but little without her interest in him on what did that sentiment unsolicited and unrecompensed rest what good again for it was much like his question about mr verver should he ever have done her the prince s notion of a recompense to women similar in this to his notion of an appeal was more or less to make love to them now he hadn t as he believed made love the least little bit to mrs assingham nor did he think she had for a moment supposed it he liked in these days to mark them off the women to whom he hadn t made love it represented and that was what pleased him in it a different stage of existence from the time at which he liked to mark off the women to whom he had neither with all this had mrs assingham herself been either aggressive or resentful on what occasion ever had she appeared to find him wanting these things the motives of such people were obscure a little alarmingly so they contributed to that element of the impenetrable which alone slightly qualified his sense of his good fortune he remembered to have read as a boy a wonderful tale by allan poe his prospective wife s countryman which was a thing to show by the way what imagination americans could have the story of the shipwrecked gordon pym who drifting in a small boat further toward the north pole or was it the south than anyone had ever done found at a given moment before him a thickness of white air that was like a dazzling curtain of light concealing as darkness conceals yet of the colour of milk or of snow there were moments when he felt his own boat move upon some such mystery the state of mind of his new friends including mrs assingham herself had resemblances to a great white curtain he had never known curtains but as purple even to blackness but as producing where they hung a darkness intended and ominous when they were so disposed as to shelter surprises the surprises were apt to be shocks shocks however from these quite different depths were not what he saw reason to apprehend what he rather seemed to himself not yet to have measured was something that seeking a name for it he would have called the quantity of confidence reposed in him he had stood still at many a moment of the previous month with the thought freshly determined or renewed of the general expectation to define it roughly of which he was the subject what was singular was that it seemed not so much an expectation of anything in particular as a large bland blank assumption of merits almost beyond notation of essential quality and value it was as if he had been some old embossed coin of a purity of gold no longer used stamped with glorious arms mediaeval wonderful of which the worth in mere modern change sovereigns and half crowns would be great enough but as to which since there were finer ways of using it such taking to pieces was superfluous that was the image for the security in which it was open to him to rest he was to constitute a possession yet was to escape being reduced to his component parts what would this mean but that practically he was never to be tried or tested what would it mean but that if they didn t change him they really wouldn t know he wouldn t know himself how many pounds shillings and pence he had to give these at any rate for the present were unanswerable questions all that was before him was that he was invested with attributes he was taken seriously lost there in the white mist was the seriousness in them that made them so take him it was even in mrs assingham in spite of her having as she had frequently shown a more mocking spirit all he could say as yet was that he had done nothing so far as to break any charm what should he do if he were to ask her frankly this afternoon what was morally speaking behind their veil it would come to asking what they expected him to do she would answer him probably oh you know it s what we expect you to be on which he would have no resource but to deny his knowledge would that break the spell his saying he had no idea what idea in fact could he have he also took himself seriously made a point of it but it wasn t simply a question of fancy and pretension his own estimate he saw ways at one time and another of dealing with but theirs sooner or later say what they might would put him to the practical proof as the practical proof accordingly would naturally be proportionate to the cluster of his attributes one arrived at a scale that he was not honestly the man to calculate who but a billionaire could say what was fair exchange for a billion that measure was the shrouded object but he felt really as his cab stopped in cadogan place a little nearer the shroud he promised himself virtually to give the latter a twitch ii they re not good days you know he had said to fanny assingham after declaring himself grateful for finding her and then with his cup of tea putting her in possession of the latest news the documents signed an hour ago de part et d autre and the telegram from his backers who had reached paris the morning before and who pausing there a little poor dears seemed to think the whole thing a tremendous lark we re very simple folk mere country cousins compared with you he had also observed and paris for my sister and her husband is the end of the world london therefore will be more or less another planet it has always been as with so many of us quite their mecca but this is their first real caravan they ve mainly known old england as a shop for articles in india rubber and leather in which they ve dressed themselves as much as possible which all means however that you ll see them all of them wreathed in smiles we must be very easy with them maggie s too wonderful her preparations are on a scale she insists on taking in the sposi and my uncle the others will come to me i ve been engaging their rooms at the hotel and with all those solemn signatures of an hour ago that brings the case home to me do you mean you re afraid his hostess had amusedly asked terribly afraid i ve now but to wait to see the monster come they re not good days they re neither one thing nor the other i ve really got nothing yet i ve everything to lose one doesn t know what still may happen the way she laughed at him was for an instant almost irritating it came out for his fancy from behind the white curtain it was a sign that is of her deep serenity which worried instead of soothing him and to be soothed after all to be tided over in his mystic impatience to be told what he could understand and believe that was what he had come for marriage then said mrs assingham is what you call the monster i admit it s a fearful thing at the best but for heaven s sake if that s what you re thinking of don t run away from it ah to run away from it would be to run away from you the prince replied and i ve already told you often enough how i depend on you to see me through he so liked the way she took this from the corner of her sofa that he gave his sincerity for it was sincerity fuller expression i m starting on the great voyage across the unknown sea my ship s all rigged and appointed the cargo s stowed away and the company complete but what seems the matter with me is that i can t sail alone my ship must be one of a pair must have in the waste of waters a what do you call it a consort i don t ask you to stay on board with me but i must keep your sail in sight for orientation i don t in the least myself know i assure you the points of the compass but with a lead i can perfectly follow you must be my lead how can you be sure she asked where i should take you why from your having brought me safely thus far i should never have got here without you you ve provided the ship itself and if you ve not quite seen me aboard you ve attended me ever so kindly to the dock your own vessel is all conveniently in the next berth and you can t desert me now she showed him again her amusement which struck him even as excessive as if to his surprise he made her also a little nervous she treated him in fine as if he were not uttering truths but making pretty figures for her diversion my vessel dear prince she smiled what vessel in the world have i this little house is all our ship bob s and mine and thankful we are now to have it we ve wandered far living as you may say from hand to mouth without rest for the soles of our feet but the time has come for us at last to draw in he made at this the young man an indignant protest you talk about rest it s too selfish when you re just launching me on adventures she shook her head with her kind lucidity not adventures heaven forbid you ve had yours as i ve had mine and my idea has been all along that we should neither of us begin again my own last precisely has been doing for you all you so prettily mention but it consists simply in having conducted you to rest you talk about ships but they re not the comparison your tossings are over you re practically in port the port she concluded of the golden isles he looked about to put himself more in relation with the place then after an hesitation seemed to speak certain words instead of certain others oh i know where i am i do decline to be left but what i came for of course was to thank you if to day has seemed for the first time the end of preliminaries i feel how little there would have been any at all without you the first were wholly yours well said mrs assingham they were remarkably easy i ve seen them i ve had them she smiled more difficult everything you must feel went of itself so you must feel everything still goes the prince quickly agreed oh beautifully but you had the conception ah prince so had you he looked at her harder a moment you had it first you had it most she returned his look as if it had made her wonder i liked it if that s what you mean but you liked it surely yourself i protest that i had easy work with you i had only at last when i thought it was time to speak for you all that is quite true but you re leaving me all the same you re leaving me you re washing your hands of me he went on however that won t be easy i won t be left and he had turned his eyes about again taking in the pretty room that she had just described as her final refuge the place of peace for a world worn couple to which she had lately retired with bob i shall keep this spot in sight say what you will i shall need you i m not you know he declared going to give you up for anybody if you re afraid which of course you re not are you trying to make me the same she asked after a moment he waited a minute too then answered her with a question you say you liked it your undertaking to make my engagement possible it remains beautiful for me that you did it s charming and unforgettable but still more it s mysterious and wonderful why you dear delightful woman did you like it i scarce know what to make she said of such an inquiry if you haven t by this time found out yourself what meaning can anything i say have for you don t you really after all feel she added while nothing came from him aren t you conscious every minute of the perfection of the creature of whom i ve put you into possession every minute gratefully conscious but that s exactly the ground of my question it wasn t only a matter of your handing me over it was a matter of your handing her it was a matter of her fate still more than of mine you thought all the good of her that one woman can think of another and yet by your account you enjoyed assisting at her risk she had kept her eyes on him while he spoke and this was what visibly determined a repetition for her are you trying to frighten me ah that s a foolish view i should be too vulgar you apparently can t understand either my good faith or my humility i m awfully humble the young man insisted that s the way i ve been feeling to day with everything so finished and ready and you won t take me for serious she continued to face him as if he really troubled her a little oh you deep old italians there you are he returned it s what i wanted you to come to that s the responsible note yes she went on if you re humble you must be dangerous she had a pause while he only smiled then she said i don t in the least want to lose sight of you but even if i did i shouldn t think it right thank you for that it s what i needed of you i m sure after all that the more you re with me the more i shall understand it s the only thing in the world i want i m excellent i really think all round except that i m stupid i can do pretty well anything i see but i ve got to see it first and he pursued his demonstration i don t in the least mind its having to be shown me in fact i like that better therefore it is that i want that i shall always want your eyes through them i wish to look even at any risk of their showing me what i mayn t like for then he wound up i shall know and of that i shall never be afraid she might quite have been waiting to see what he would come to but she spoke with a certain impatience what on earth are you talking about but he could perfectly say of my real honest fear of being off some day of being wrong without knowing it that s what i shall always trust you for to tell me when i am no with you people it s a sense we haven t got it not as you have therefore but he had said enough ecco he simply smiled it was not to be concealed that he worked upon her but of course she had always liked him i should be interested she presently remarked to see some sense you don t possess well he produced one on the spot the moral dear mrs assingham i mean always as you others consider it i ve of course something that in our poor dear backward old rome sufficiently passes for it but it s no more like yours than the tortuous stone staircase half ruined into the bargain in some castle of our quattrocento is like the lightning elevator in one of mr verver s fifteen storey buildings your moral sense works by steam it sends you up like a rocket ours is slow and steep and unlighted with so many of the steps missing that well that it s as short in almost any case to turn round and come down again trusting mrs assingham smiled to get up some other way yes or not to have to get up at all however he added i told you that at the beginning machiavelli she simply exclaimed you do me too much honour i wish indeed i had his genius however if you really believe i have his perversity you wouldn t say it but it s all right he gaily enough concluded i shall always have you to come to on this for a little they sat face to face after which without comment she asked him if he would have more tea all she would give him he promptly signified and he developed making her laugh his idea that the tea of the english race was somehow their morality made with boiling water in a little pot so that the more of it one drank the more moral one would become his drollery served as a transition and she put to him several questions about his sister and the others questions as to what bob in particular colonel assingham her husband could do for the arriving gentlemen whom by the prince s leave he would immediately go to see he was funny while they talked about his own people too whom he described with anecdotes of their habits imitations of their manners and prophecies of their conduct as more rococo than anything cadogan place would ever have known this mrs assingham professed was exactly what would endear them to her and that in turn drew from her visitor a fresh declaration of all the comfort of his being able so to depend on her he had been with her at this point some twenty minutes but he had paid her much longer visits and he stayed now as if to make his attitude prove his appreciation he stayed moreover that was really the sign of the hour in spite of the nervous unrest that had brought him and that had in truth much rather fed on the scepticism by which she had apparently meant to soothe it she had not soothed him and there arrived remarkably a moment when the cause of her failure gleamed out he had not frightened her as she called it he felt that yet she was herself not at ease she had been nervous though trying to disguise it the sight of him following on the announcement of his name had shown her as disconcerted this conviction for the young man deepened and sharpened yet with the effect too of making him glad in spite of it it was as if in calling he had done even better than he intended for it was somehow important that was what it was that there should be at this hour something the matter with mrs assingham with whom in all their acquaintance so considerable now there had never been the least little thing the matter to wait thus and watch for it was to know of a truth that there was something the matter with him since strangely with so little to go upon his heart had positively begun to beat to the tune of suspense it fairly befell at last for a climax that they almost ceased to pretend to pretend that is to cheat each other with forms the unspoken had come up and there was a crisis neither could have said how long it lasted during which they were reduced for all interchange to looking at each other on quite an inordinate scale they might at this moment in their positively portentous stillness have been keeping it up for a wager sitting for their photograph or even enacting a tableau vivant the spectator of whom they would thus well have been worthy might have read meanings of his own into the intensity of their communion or indeed even without meanings have found his account aesthetically in some gratified play of our modern sense of type so scantly to be distinguished from our modern sense of beauty type was there at the worst in mrs assingham s dark neat head on which the crisp black hair made waves so fine and so numerous that she looked even more in the fashion of the hour than she desired full of discriminations against the obvious she had yet to accept a flagrant appearance and to make the best of misleading signs her richness of hue her generous nose her eyebrows marked like those of an actress these things with an added amplitude of person on which middle age had set its seal seemed to present her insistently as a daughter of the south or still more of the east a creature formed by hammocks and divans fed upon sherbets and waited upon by slaves she looked as if her most active effort might be to take up as she lay back her mandolin or to share a sugared fruit with a pet gazelle she was in fact however neither a pampered jewess nor a lazy creole new york had been recordedly her birthplace and europe punctually her discipline she wore yellow and purple because she thought it better as she said while one was about it to look like the queen of sheba than like a revendeuse she put pearls in her hair and crimson and gold in her tea gown for the same reason it was her theory that nature itself had overdressed her and that her only course was to drown as it was hopeless to try to chasten the overdressing so she was covered and surrounded with things which were frankly toys and shams a part of the amusement with which she rejoiced to supply her friends these friends were in the game that of playing with the disparity between her aspect and her character her character was attested by the second movement of her face which convinced the beholder that her vision of the humours of the world was not supine not passive she enjoyed she needed the warm air of friendship but the eyes of the american city looked out somehow for the opportunity of it from under the lids of jerusalem with her false indolence in short her false leisure her false pearls and palms and courts and fountains she was a person for whom life was multitudinous detail detail that left her as it at any moment found her unappalled and unwearied sophisticated as i may appear it was her frequent phrase she had found sympathy her best resource it gave her plenty to do it made her as she also said sit up she had in her life two great holes to fill and she described herself as dropping social scraps into them as she had known old ladies in her early american time drop morsels of silk into the baskets in which they collected the material for some eventual patchwork quilt one of these gaps in mrs assingham s completeness was her want of children the other was her want of wealth it was wonderful how little either in the fulness of time came to show sympathy and curiosity could render their objects practically filial just as an english husband who in his military years had run everything in his regiment could make economy blossom like the rose colonel bob had a few years after his marriage left the army which had clearly by that time done its laudable all for the enrichment of his personal experience and he could thus give his whole time to the gardening in question there reigned among the younger friends of this couple a legend almost too venerable for historical criticism that the marriage itself the happiest of its class dated from the far twilight of the age a primitive period when such things such things as american girls accepted as good enough had not begun to be so that the pleasant pair had been as to the risk taken on either side bold and original honourably marked for the evening of life as discoverers of a kind of hymeneal northwest passage mrs assingham knew better knew there had been no historic hour from that of pocahontas down when some young englishman hadn t precipitately believed and some american girl hadn t with a few more gradations availed herself to the full of her incapacity to doubt but she accepted resignedly the laurel of the founder since she was in fact pretty well the doyenne above ground of her transplanted tribe and since above all she had invented combinations though she had not invented bob s own it was he who had done that absolutely puzzled it out by himself from his first odd glimmer resting upon it moreover through the years to come as proof enough in him by itself of the higher cleverness if she kept her own cleverness up it was largely that he should have full credit there were moments in truth when she privately felt how little striking out as he had done he could have afforded that she should show the common limits but mrs assingham s cleverness was in truth tested when her present visitor at last said to her i don t think you know that you re treating me quite right you ve something on your mind that you don t tell me it was positive too that her smile in reply was a trifle dim am i obliged to tell you everything i have on my mind it isn t a question of everything but it s a question of anything that may particularly concern me then you shouldn t keep it back you know with what care i desire to proceed taking everything into account and making no mistake that may possibly injure her mrs assingham at this had after an instant an odd interrogation her her and him both our friends either maggie or her father i have something on my mind mrs assingham presently returned something has happened for which i hadn t been prepared but it isn t anything that properly concerns you the prince with immediate gaiety threw back his head what do you mean by properly i somehow see volumes in it it s the way people put a thing when they put it well wrong i put things right what is it that has happened for me his hostess the next moment had drawn spirit from his tone oh i shall be delighted if you ll take your share of it charlotte stant is in london she has just been here miss stant oh really the prince expressed clear surprise a transparency through which his eyes met his friend s with a certain hardness of concussion she has arrived from america he then quickly asked she appears to have arrived this noon coming up from southampton at an hotel she dropped upon me after luncheon and was here for more than an hour the young man heard with interest though not with an interest too great for his gaiety you think then i ve a share in it what is my share why any you like the one you seemed just now eager to take it was you yourself who insisted he looked at her on this with conscious inconsistency and she could now see that he had changed colour but he was always easy i didn t know then what the matter was you didn t think it could be so bad do you call it very bad the young man asked only she smiled because that s the way it seems to affect you he hesitated still with the trace of his quickened colour still looking at her still adjusting his manner but you allowed you were upset to the extent yes of not having in the least looked for her any more said mrs assingham than i judge maggie to have done the prince thought then as if glad to be able to say something very natural and true no quite right maggie hasn t looked for her but i m sure he added she ll be delighted to see her that certainly and his hostess spoke with a different shade of gravity she ll be quite overjoyed the prince went on has miss stant now gone to her she has gone back to her hotel to bring her things here i can t have her said mrs assingham alone at an hotel no i see if she s here at all she must stay with me he quite took it in so she s coming now i expect her at any moment if you wait you ll see her oh he promptly declared charming but this word came out as if a little in sudden substitution for some other it sounded accidental whereas he wished to be firm that accordingly was what he next showed himself if it wasn t for what s going on these next days maggie would certainly want to have her in fact he lucidly continued isn t what s happening just a reason to make her want to mrs assingham for answer only looked at him and this the next instant had apparently had more effect than if she had spoken for he asked a question that seemed incongruous what has she come for it made his companion laugh why for just what you say for your marriage mine he wondered maggie s it s the same thing it s for your great event and then said mrs assingham she s so lonely has she given you that as a reason i scarcely remember she gave me so many she abounds poor dear in reasons but there s one that whatever she does i always remember for myself and which is that he looked as if he ought to guess but couldn t why the fact that she has no home absolutely none whatever she s extraordinarily alone again he took it in and also has no great means very small ones which is not however with the expense of railways and hotels a reason for her running to and fro on the contrary but she doesn t like her country hers my dear man it s little enough hers the attribution for the moment amused his hostess she has rebounded now but she has had little enough else to do with it oh i say hers the prince pleasantly explained very much as at this time of day i might say mine i quite feel i assure you as if the great place already more or less belonged to me that s your good fortune and your point of view you own or you soon practically will own so much of it charlotte owns almost nothing in the world she tells me but two colossal trunks only one of which i have given her leave to introduce into this house she ll depreciate to you mrs assingham added your property he thought of these things he thought of every thing but he had always his resource at hand of turning all to the easy has she come with designs upon me and then in a moment as if even this were almost too grave he sounded the note that had least to do with himself est elle toujours aussi belle that was the furthest point somehow to which charlotte stant could be relegated mrs assingham treated it freely just the same the person in the world to my sense whose looks are most subject to appreciation it s all in the way she affects you one admires her if one doesn t happen not to so as well one criticises her ah that s not fair said the prince to criticise her then there you are you re answered i m answered he took it humorously as his lesson sank his previous self consciousness with excellent effect in grateful docility i only meant that there are perhaps better things to be done with miss stant than to criticise her when once you begin that with anyone he was vague and kind i quite agree that it s better to keep out of it as long as one can but when one must do it yes he asked as she paused then know what you mean i see perhaps he smiled i don t know what i mean well it s what just now in all ways you particularly should know mrs assingham however made no more of this having before anything else apparently a scruple about the tone she had just used i quite understand of course that given her great friendship with maggie she should have wanted to be present she has acted impulsively but she has acted generously she has acted beautifully said the prince i say generously because i mean she hasn t in any way counted the cost she ll have it to count in a manner now his hostess continued but that doesn t matter he could see how little you ll look after her i ll look after her so it s all right it s all right said mrs assingham then why are you troubled it pulled her up but only for a minute i m not any more than you the prince s dark blue eyes were of the finest and on occasion precisely resembled nothing so much as the high windows of a roman palace of an historic front by one of the great old designers thrown open on a feast day to the golden air his look itself at such times suggested an image that of some very noble personage who expected acclaimed by the crowd in the street and with old precious stuffs falling over the sill for his support had gaily and gallantly come to show himself always moreover less in his own interest than in that of spectators and subjects whose need to admire even to gape was periodically to be considered the young man s expression became after this fashion something vivid and concrete a beautiful personal presence that of a prince in very truth a ruler warrior patron lighting up brave architecture and diffusing the sense of a function it had been happily said of his face that the figure thus appearing in the great frame was the ghost of some proudest ancestor whoever the ancestor now at all events the prince was for mrs assingham s benefit in view of the people he seemed leaning on crimson damask to take in the bright day he looked younger than his years he was beautiful innocent vague oh well i m not he rang out clear i should like to see you sir she said for you wouldn t have a shadow of excuse he showed how he agreed that he would have been at a loss for one and the fact of their serenity was thus made as important as if some danger of its opposite had directly menaced them the only thing was that if the evidence of their cheer was so established mrs assingham had a little to explain her original manner and she came to this before they dropped the question my first impulse is always to behave about everything as if i feared complications but i don t fear them i really like them they re quite my element he deferred for her to this account of herself but still he said if we re not in the presence of a complication she hesitated a handsome clever odd girl staying with one is always a complication the young man weighed it almost as if the question were new to him and will she stay very long his friend gave a laugh how in the world can i know i ve scarcely asked her ah yes you can t but something in the tone of it amused her afresh do you think you could i he wondered do you think you could get it out of her for me the probable length of her stay he rose bravely enough to the occasion and the challenge i daresay if you were to give me the chance here it is then for you she answered for she had heard within the minute the stop of a cab at her door she s back iii it had been said as a joke but as after this they awaited their friend in silence the effect of the silence was to turn the time to gravity a gravity not dissipated even when the prince next spoke he had been thinking the case over and making up his mind a handsome clever odd girl staying with one was a complication mrs assingham so far was right but there were the facts the good relations from schooldays of the two young women and the clear confidence with which one of them had arrived she can come you know at any time to us mrs assingham took it up with an irony beyond laughter you d like her for your honeymoon oh no you must keep her for that but why not after she had looked at him a minute then at the sound of a voice in the corridor they had got up why not you re splendid charlotte stant the next minute was with them ushered in as she had alighted from her cab and prepared for not finding mrs assingham alone this would have been to be noticed by the butler s answer on the stairs to a question put to him she could have looked at her hostess with such straightness and brightness only from knowing that the prince was also there the discrimination of but a moment yet which let him take her in still better than if she had instantly faced him he availed himself of the chance thus given him for he was conscious of all these things what he accordingly saw for some seconds with intensity was a tall strong charming girl who wore for him at first exactly the look of her adventurous situation a suggestion in all her person in motion and gesture in free vivid yet altogether happy indications of dress from the becoming compactness of her hat to the shade of tan in her shoes of winds and waves and custom houses of far countries and long journeys the knowledge of how and where and the habit founded on experience of not being afraid he was aware at the same time that of this combination the strongminded note was not as might have been apprehended the basis he was now sufficiently familiar with english speaking types he had sounded attentively enough such possibilities for a quick vision of differences he had besides his own view of this young lady s strength of mind it was great he had ground to believe but it would never interfere with the play of her extremely personal her always amusing taste this last was the thing in her for she threw it out positively on the spot like a light that she might have reappeared during these moments just to cool his worried eyes with he saw her in her light that immediate exclusive address to their friend was like a lamp she was holding aloft for his benefit and for his pleasure it showed him everything above all her presence in the world so closely so irretrievably contemporaneous with his own a sharp sharp fact sharper during these instants than any other at all even than that of his marriage but accompanied in a subordinate and controlled way with those others facial physiognomic that mrs assingham had been speaking of as subject to appreciation so they were these others as he met them again and that was the connection they instantly established with him if they had to be interpreted this made at least for intimacy there was but one way certainly for him to interpret them in the sense of the already known making use then of clumsy terms of excess the face was too narrow and too long the eyes not large and the mouth on the other hand by no means small with substance in its lips and a slight the very slightest tendency to protrusion in the solid teeth otherwise indeed well arrayed and flashingly white but it was strangely as a cluster of possessions of his own that these things in charlotte stant now affected him items in a full list items recognised each of them as if for the long interval they had been stored wrapped up numbered put away in a cabinet while she faced mrs assingham the door of the cabinet had opened of itself he took the relics out one by one and it was more and more each instant as if she were giving him time he saw again that her thick hair was vulgarly speaking brown but that there was a shade of tawny autumn leaf in it for appreciation a colour indescribable and of which he had known no other case something that gave her at moments the sylvan head of a huntress he saw the sleeves of her jacket drawn to her wrists but he again made out the free arms within them to be of the completely rounded the polished slimness that florentine sculptors in the great time had loved and of which the apparent firmness is expressed in their old silver and old bronze he knew her narrow hands he knew her long fingers and the shape and colour of her finger nails he knew her special beauty of movement and line when she turned her back and the perfect working of all her main attachments that of some wonderful finished instrument something intently made for exhibition for a prize he knew above all the extraordinary fineness of her flexible waist the stem of an expanded flower which gave her a likeness also to some long loose silk purse well filled with gold pieces but having been passed empty through a finger ring that held it together it was as if before she turned to him he had weighed the whole thing in his open palm and even heard a little the chink of the metal when she did turn to him it was to recognise with her eyes what he might have been doing she made no circumstance of thus coming upon him save so far as the intelligence in her face could at any moment make a circumstance of almost anything if when she moved off she looked like a huntress she looked when she came nearer like his notion perhaps not wholly correct of a muse but what she said was simply you see you re not rid of me how is dear maggie it was to come soon enough by the quite unforced operation of chance the young man s opportunity to ask her the question suggested by mrs assingham shortly before her entrance the license had he chosen to embrace it was within a few minutes all there the license given him literally to inquire of this young lady how long she was likely to be with them for a matter of the mere domestic order had quickly determined on mrs assingham s part a withdrawal of a few moments which had the effect of leaving her visitors free mrs betterman s there she had said to charlotte in allusion to some member of the household who was to have received her and seen her belongings settled to which charlotte had replied that she had encountered only the butler who had been quite charming she had deprecated any action taken on behalf of her effects but her hostess rebounding from accumulated cushions evidently saw more in mrs betterman s non appearance than could meet the casual eye what she saw in short demanded her intervention in spite of an earnest let me go from the girl and a prolonged smiling wail over the trouble she was giving the prince was quite aware at this moment that departure for himself was indicated the question of miss stant s installation didn t demand his presence it was a case for one to go away if one hadn t a reason for staying he had a reason however of that he was equally aware and he had not for a good while done anything more conscious and intentional than not quickly to take leave his visible insistence for it came to that even demanded of him a certain disagreeable effort the sort of effort he had mostly associated with acting for an idea his idea was there his idea was to find out something something he wanted much to know and to find it out not tomorrow not at some future time not in short with waiting and wondering but if possible before quitting the place this particular curiosity moreover confounded itself a little with the occasion offered him to satisfy mrs assingham s own he wouldn t have admitted that he was staying to ask a rude question there was distinctly nothing rude in his having his reasons it would be rude for that matter to turn one s back without a word or two on an old friend well as it came to pass he got the word or two for mrs assingham s preoccupation was practically simplifying the little crisis was of shorter duration than our account of it duration naturally would have forced him to take up his hat he was somehow glad on finding himself alone with charlotte that he had not been guilty of that inconsequence not to be flurried was the kind of consistency he wanted just as consistency was the kind of dignity and why couldn t he have dignity when he had so much of the good conscience as it were on which such advantages rested he had done nothing he oughtn t he had in fact done nothing at all once more as a man conscious of having known many women he could assist as he would have called it at the recurrent the predestined phenomenon the thing always as certain as sunrise or the coming round of saints days the doing by the woman of the thing that gave her away she did it ever inevitably infallibly she couldn t possibly not do it it was her nature it was her life and the man could always expect it without lifting a finger this was his the man s any man s position and strength that he had necessarily the advantage that he only had to wait with a decent patience to be placed in spite of himself it might really be said in the right just so the punctuality of performance on the part of the other creature was her weakness and her deep misfortune not less no doubt than her beauty it produced for the man that extraordinary mixture of pity and profit in which his relation with her when he was not a mere brute mainly consisted and gave him in fact his most pertinent ground of being always nice to her nice about her nice for her she always dressed her act up of course she muffled and disguised and arranged it showing in fact in these dissimulations a cleverness equal to but one thing in the world equal to her abjection she would let it be known for anything for everything but the truth of which it was made that was what precisely charlotte stant would be doing now that was the present motive and support to a certainty of each of her looks and motions she was the twentieth woman she was possessed by her doom but her doom was also to arrange appearances and what now concerned him was to learn how she proposed he would help her would arrange with her to any point in reason the only thing was to know what appearance could best be produced and best be preserved produced and preserved on her part of course since on his own there had been luckily no folly to cover up nothing but a perfect accord between conduct and obligation they stood there together at all events when the door had closed behind their friend with a conscious strained smile and very much as if each waited for the other to strike the note or give the pitch the young man held himself in his silent suspense only not more afraid because he felt her own fear she was afraid of herself however whereas to his gain of lucidity he was afraid only of her would she throw herself into his arms or would she be otherwise wonderful she would see what he would do so their queer minute without words told him and she would act accordingly but what could he do but just let her see that he would make anything everything for her as honourably easy as possible even if she should throw herself into his arms he would make that easy easy that is to overlook to ignore not to remember and not by the same token either to regret this was not what in fact happened though it was also not at a single touch but by the finest gradations that his tension subsided it s too delightful to be back she said at last and it was all she definitely gave him being moreover nothing but what anyone else might have said yet with two or three other things that on his response followed it it quite pointed the path while the tone of it and her whole attitude were as far removed as need have been from the truth of her situation the abjection that was present to him as of the essence quite failed to peep out and he soon enough saw that if she was arranging she could be trusted to arrange good it was all he asked and all the more that he could admire and like her for it the particular appearance she would as they said go in for was that of having no account whatever to give him it would be in fact that of having none to give anybody of reasons or of motives of comings or of goings she was a charming young woman who had met him before but she was also a charming young woman with a life of her own she would take it high up up up ever so high well then he would do the same no height would be too great for them not even the dizziest conceivable to a young person so subtle the dizziest seemed indeed attained when after another moment she came as near as she was to come to an apology for her abruptness i ve been thinking of maggie and at last i yearned for her i wanted to see her happy and it doesn t strike me i find you too shy to tell me i shall of course she s happy thank god only it s almost terrible you know the happiness of young good generous creatures it rather frightens one but the blessed virgin and all the saints said the prince have her in their keeping certainly they have she s the dearest of the dear but i needn t tell you the girl added ah he returned with gravity i feel that i ve still much to learn about her to which he subjoined she ll rejoice awfully in your being with us oh you don t need me charlotte smiled it s her hour it s a great hour one has seen often enough with girls what it is but that she said is exactly why why i ve wanted i mean not to miss it he bent on her a kind comprehending face you mustn t miss anything he had got it the pitch and he could keep it now for all he had needed was to have it given him the pitch was the happiness of his wife that was to be the sight of that happiness as a joy for an old friend it was yes magnificent and not the less so for its coming to him suddenly as sincere as nobly exalted something in charlotte s eyes seemed to tell him this seemed to plead with him in advance as to what he was to find in it he was eager and he tried to show her that too to find what she liked mindful as he easily could be of what the friendship had been for maggie it had been armed with the wings of young imagination young generosity it had been he believed always counting out her intense devotion to her father the liveliest emotion she had known before the dawn of the sentiment inspired by himself she had not to his knowledge invited the object of it to their wedding had not thought of proposing to her for a matter of a couple of hours an arduous and expensive journey but she had kept her connected and informed from week to week in spite of preparations and absorptions oh i ve been writing to charlotte i wish you knew her better he could still hear from recent weeks this record of the fact just as he could still be conscious not otherwise than queerly of the gratuitous element in maggie s wish which he had failed as yet to indicate to her older and perhaps more intelligent at any rate why shouldn t charlotte respond and be quite free to respond to such fidelities with something more than mere formal good manners the relations of women with each other were of the strangest it was true and he probably wouldn t have trusted here a young person of his own race he was proceeding throughout on the ground of the immense difference difficult indeed as it might have been to disembroil in this young person her race quality nothing in her definitely placed her she was a rare a special product her singleness her solitude her want of means that is her want of ramifications and other advantages contributed to enrich her somehow with an odd precious neutrality to constitute for her so detached yet so aware a sort of small social capital it was the only one she had it was the only one a lonely gregarious girl could have since few surely had in anything like the same degree arrived at it and since this one indeed had compassed it but through the play of some gift of nature to which you could scarce give a definite name it wasn t a question of her strange sense for tongues with which she juggled as a conjuror at a show juggled with balls or hoops or lighted brands it wasn t at least entirely that for he had known people almost as polyglot whom their accomplishment had quite failed to make interesting he was polyglot himself for that matter as was the case too with so many of his friends and relations for none of whom more than for himself was it anything but a common convenience the point was that in this young woman it was a beauty in itself and almost a mystery so certainly he had more than once felt in noting on her lips that rarest among the barbarians of all civil graces a perfect felicity in the use of italian he had known strangers a few and mostly men who spoke his own language agreeably but he had known neither man nor woman who showed for it charlotte s almost mystifying instinct he remembered how from the first of their acquaintance she had made no display of it quite as if english between them his english so matching with hers were their inevitable medium he had perceived all by accident by hearing her talk before him to somebody else that they had an alternative as good an alternative in fact as much better as the amusement for him was greater in watching her for the slips that never came her account of the mystery didn t suffice her recall of her birth in florence and florentine childhood her parents from the great country but themselves already of a corrupt generation demoralised falsified polyglot well before her with the tuscan balia who was her first remembrance the servants of the villa the dear contadini of the poder the little girls and the other peasants of the next podere all the rather shabby but still ever so pretty human furniture of her early time including the good sisters of the poor convent of the tuscan hills the convent shabbier than almost anything else but prettier too in which she had been kept at school till the subsequent phase the phase of the much grander institution in paris at which maggie was to arrive terribly frightened and as a smaller girl three years before her own ending of her period of five such reminiscences naturally gave a ground but they had not prevented him from insisting that some strictly civil ancestor generations back and from the tuscan hills if she would made himself felt ineffaceably in her blood and in her tone she knew nothing of the ancestor but she had taken his theory from him gracefully enough as one of the little presents that make friendship flourish these matters however all melted together now though a sense of them was doubtless concerned not unnaturally in the next thing of the nature of a surmise that his discretion let him articulate you haven t i rather gather particularly liked your country they would stick for the time to their english it doesn t i fear seem particularly mine and it doesn t in the least matter over there whether one likes it or not that is to anyone but one s self but i didn t like it said charlotte stant that s not encouraging then to me is it the prince went on do you mean because you re going oh yes of course we re going i ve wanted immensely to go she hesitated but now immediately in a month or two it seems to be the new idea on which there was something in her face as he imagined that made him say didn t maggie write to you not of your going at once but of course you must go and of course you must stay charlotte was easily clear as long as possible is that what you did he laughed you stayed as long as possible well it seemed to me so but i hadn t interests you ll have them on a great scale it s the country for interests said charlotte if i had only had a few i doubtless wouldn t have left it he waited an instant they were still on their feet yours then are rather here oh mine the girl smiled they take up little room wherever they are it determined in him the way this came from her and what it somehow did for her it determined in him a speech that would have seemed a few minutes before precarious and in questionable taste the lead she had given him made the difference and he felt it as really a lift on finding an honest and natural word rise by its license to his lips nothing surely could be for both of them more in the note of a high bravery i ve been thinking it all the while so probable you know that you would have seen your way to marrying she looked at him an instant and just for these seconds he feared for what he might have spoiled to marrying whom why some good kind clever rich american again his security hung in the balance then she was as he felt admirable i tried everyone i came across i did my best i showed i had come quite publicly for that perhaps i showed it too much at any rate it was no use i had to recognise it no one would have me then she seemed to show as sorry for his having to hear of her anything so disconcerting she pitied his feeling about it if he was disappointed she would cheer him up existence you know all the same doesn t depend on that i mean she smiled on having caught a husband oh existence the prince vaguely commented you think i ought to argue for more than mere existence she asked i don t see why my existence even reduced as much as you like to being merely mine should be so impossible there are things of sorts i should be able to have things i should be able to be the position of a single woman to day is very favourable you know favourable to what why just to existence which may contain after all in one way and another so much it may contain at the worst even affections affections in fact quite particularly fixed that is on one s friends i m extremely fond of maggie for instance i quite adore her how could i adore her more if i were married to one of the people you speak of the prince gave a laugh you might adore him more ah but it isn t is it she asked a question of that my dear friend he returned it s always a question of doing the best for one s self one can without injury to others he felt by this time that they were indeed on an excellent basis so he went on again as if to show frankly his sense of its firmness i venture therefore to repeat my hope that you ll marry some capital fellow and also to repeat my belief that such a marriage will be more favourable to you as you call it than even the spirit of the age she looked at him at first only for answer and would have appeared to take it with meekness had she not perhaps appeared a little more to take it with gaiety thank you very much she simply said but at that moment their friend was with them again it was undeniable that as she came in mrs assingham looked with a certain smiling sharpness from one of them to the other the perception of which was perhaps what led charlotte for reassurance to pass the question on the prince hopes so much i shall still marry some good person whether it worked for mrs assingham or not the prince was himself at this more than ever reassured he was safe in a word that was what it all meant and he had required to be safe he was really safe enough for almost any joke it s only he explained to their hostess because of what miss stant has been telling me don t we want to keep up her courage if the joke was broad he had at least not begun it not that is as a joke which was what his companion s address to their friend made of it she has been trying in america she says but hasn t brought it off the tone was somehow not what mrs assingham had expected but she made the best of it well then she replied to the young man if you take such an interest you must bring it off and you must help dear charlotte said unperturbed as you ve helped so beautifully in such things before with which before mrs assingham could meet the appeal she had addressed herself to the prince on a matter much nearer to him your mar riage is on friday on saturday oh on friday no for what do you take us there s not a vulgar omen we re neglecting on saturday please at the oratory at three o clock before twelve assistants exactly twelve including me it struck him he laughed you ll make the thirteenth it won t do not said charlotte if you re going in for omens should you like me to stay away dear no we ll manage we ll make the round number we ll have in some old woman they must keep them there for that don t they mrs assingham s return had at last indicated for him his departure he had possessed himself again of his hat and approached her to take leave but he had another word for charlotte i dine to night with mr verver have you any message the girl seemed to wonder a little for mr verver for maggie about her seeing you early that i know is what she ll like then i ll come early thanks i daresay he went on she ll send for you i mean send a carriage oh i don t require that thanks i can go for a penny can t i she asked of mrs assingham in an omnibus oh i say said the prince while mrs assingham looked at her blandly yes love and i ll give you the penny she shall get there the good lady added to their friend but charlotte as the latter took leave of her thought of something else there s a great favour prince that i want to ask of you i want between this and saturday to make maggie a marriage present oh i say the young man again soothingly exclaimed ah but i must she went on it s really almost for that i came back it was impossible to get in america what i wanted mrs assingham showed anxiety what is it then dear you want but the girl looked only at their companion that s what the prince if he ll be so good must help me to decide can t i mrs assingham asked help you to decide certainly darling we must talk it well over and she kept her eyes on the prince but i want him if he kindly will to go with me to look i want him to judge with me and choose that if you can spare the hour she said is the great favour i mean he raised his eyebrows at her he wonderfully smiled what you came back from america to ask ah certainly then i must find the hour he wonderfully smiled but it was rather more after all than he had been reckoning with it went somehow so little with the rest that directly for him it wasn t the note of safety it preserved this character at the best but by being the note of publicity quickly quickly however the note of publicity struck him as better than any other in another moment even it seemed positively what he wanted for what so much as publicity put their relation on the right footing by this appeal to mrs assingham it was established as right and she immediately showed that such was her own understanding certainly prince she laughed you must find the hour and it was really so express a license from her as representing friendly judgment public opinion the moral law the margin allowed a husband about to be or whatever that after observing to charlotte that should she come to portland place in the morn ing he would make a point of being there to see her and so easily arrange with her about a time he took his departure with the absolutely confirmed impression of knowing as he put it to himself where he was which was what he had prolonged his visit for he was where he could stay iv i don t quite see my dear colonel assingham said to his wife the night of charlotte s arrival i don t quite see i m bound to say why you take it even at the worst so ferociously hard it isn t your fault after all is it i ll be hanged at any rate if it s mine the hour was late and the young lady who had disembarked at southampton that morning to come up by the steamer special and who had then settled herself at an hotel only to re settle herself a couple of hours later at a private house was by this time they might hope peacefully resting from her exploits there had been two men at dinner rather battered brothers in arms of his own period casually picked up by her host the day before and when the gentlemen after the meal rejoined the ladies in the drawing room charlotte pleading fatigue had already excused herself the beguiled warriors however had stayed till after eleven mrs assingham though finally quite without illusions as she said about the military character was always beguiling to old soldiers and as the colonel had come in before dinner only in time to dress he had not till this moment really been summoned to meet his companion over the situation that as he was now to learn their visitor s advent had created for them it was actually more than midnight the servants had been sent to bed the rattle of the wheels had ceased to come in through a window still open to the august air and robert assingham had been steadily learning all the while what it thus behoved him to know but the words just quoted from him presented themselves for the moment as the essence of his spirit and his attitude he disengaged he would be damned if he didn t they were both phrases he repeatedly used his responsibility the simplest the sanest the most obliging of men he habitually indulged in extravagant language his wife had once told him in relation to his violence of speech that such excesses on his part made her think of a retired general whom she had once seen playing with toy soldiers fighting and winning battles carrying on sieges and annihilating enemies with little fortresses of wood and little armies of tin her husband s exaggerated emphasis was his box of toy soldiers his military game it harmlessly gratified in him for his declining years the military instinct bad words when sufficiently numerous and arrayed in their might could represent battalions squadrons tremendous cannonades and glorious charges of cavalry it was natural it was delightful the romance and for her as well of camp life and of the perpetual booming of guns it was fighting to the end to the death but no one was ever killed less fortunate than she nevertheless in spite of his wealth of expression he had not yet found the image that described her favourite game all he could do was practically to leave it to her emulating her own philosophy he had again and again sat up late to discuss those situations in which her finer consciousness abounded but he had never failed to deny that anything in life anything of hers could be a situation for himself she might be in fifty at once if she liked and it was what women did like at their ease after all there always being when they had too much of any some man as they were well aware to get them out he wouldn t at any price have one of any sort whatever of his own or even be in one along with her he watched her accordingly in her favourite element very much as he had sometimes watched at the aquarium the celebrated lady who in a slight though tight bathing suit turned somersaults and did tricks in the tank of water which looked so cold and uncomfortable to the non amphibious he listened to his companion to night while he smoked his last pipe he watched her through her demonstration quite as if he had paid a shilling but it was true that this being the case he desired the value of his money what was it in the name of wonder that she was so bent on being responsible for what did she pretend was going to happen and what at the worst could the poor girl do even granting she wanted to do anything what at the worst for that matter could she be conceived to have in her head if she had told me the moment she got here mrs assingham replied i shouldn t have my difficulty in finding out but she wasn t so obliging and i see no sign at all of her becoming so what s certain is that she didn t come for nothing she wants she worked it out at her leisure to see the prince again that isn t what troubles me i mean that such a fact as a fact isn t but what i ask myself is what does she want it for what s the good of asking yourself if you know you don t know the colonel sat back at his own ease with an ankle resting on the other knee and his eyes attentive to the good appearance of an extremely slender foot which he kept jerking in its neat integument of fine spun black silk and patent leather it seemed to confess this member to consciousness of military discipline everything about it being as polished and perfect as straight and tight and trim as a soldier on parade it went so far as to imply that someone or other would have got something or other confinement to barracks or suppression of pay if it hadn t been just as it was bob assingham was distinguished altogether by a leanness of person a leanness quite distinct from physical laxity which might have been determined on the part of superior powers by views of transport and accommodation and which in fact verged on the abnormal he did himself as well as his friends mostly knew yet remained hungrily thin with facial with abdominal cavities quite grim in their effect and with a consequent looseness of apparel that combined with a choice of queer light shades and of strange straw like textures of the aspect of chinese mats provocative of wonder at his sources of supply suggested the habit of tropic islands a continual cane bottomed chair a governorship exercised on wide verandahs his smooth round head with the particular shade of its white hair was like a silver pot reversed his cheekbones and the bristle of his moustache were worthy of attila the hun the hollows of his eyes were deep and darksome but the eyes within them were like little blue flowers plucked that morning he knew everything that could be known about life which he regarded as for far the greater part a matter of pecuniary arrangement his wife accused him of a want alike of moral and of intellectual reaction or rather indeed of a complete incapacity for either he never went even so far as to understand what she meant and it didn t at all matter since he could be in spite of the limitation a perfectly social creature the infirmities the predicaments of men neither surprised nor shocked him and indeed which was perhaps his only real loss in a thrifty career scarce even amused he took them for granted without horror classifying them after their kind and calculating results and chances he might in old bewildering climates in old campaigns of cruelty and license have had such revelations and known such amazements that he had nothing more to learn but he was wholly content in spite of his fondness in domestic discussion for the superlative degree and his kindness in the oddest way seemed to have nothing to do with his experience he could deal with things perfectly for all his needs without getting near them this was the way he dealt with his wife a large proportion of whose meanings he knew he could neglect he edited for their general economy the play of her mind just as he edited savingly with the stump of a pencil her redundant telegrams the thing in the world that was least of a mystery to him was his club which he was accepted as perhaps too completely managing and which he managed on lines of perfect penetration his connection with it was really a master piece of editing this was in fact to come back very much the process he might have been proposing to apply to mrs assingham s view of what was now before them that is to their connection with charlotte stant s possibilities they wouldn t lavish on them all their little fortune of curiosity and alarm certainly they wouldn t spend their cherished savings so early in the day he liked charlotte moreover who was a smooth and compact inmate and whom he felt as with her instincts that made against waste much more of his own sort than his wife he could talk with her about fanny almost better than he could talk with fanny about charlotte however he made at present the best of the latter necessity even to the pressing of the question he has been noted as having last uttered if you can t think what to be afraid of wait till you can think then you ll do it much better or otherwise if that s waiting too long find out from her don t try to find out from me ask her herself mrs assingham denied as we know that her husband had a play of mind so that she could on her side treat these remarks only as if they had been senseless physical gestures or nervous facial movements she overlooked them as from habit and kindness yet there was no one to whom she talked so persistently of such intimate things it s her friendship with maggie that s the immense complication because that she audibly mused is so natural then why can t she have come out for it she came out mrs assingham continued to meditate because she hates america there was no place for her there she didn t fit in she wasn t in sympathy no more were the people she saw then it s hideously dear she can t on her means begin to live there not at all as she can in a way here in the way you mean of living with us of living with anyone she can t live by visits alone and she doesn t want to she s too good for it even if she could but she will she must sooner or later stay with them maggie will want her maggie will make her besides she ll want to herself then why won t that do the colonel asked for you to think it s what she has come for how will it do how she went on as without hearing him that s what one keeps feeling why shouldn t it do beautifully that anything of the past she brooded should come back now how will it do how will it do it will do i daresay without your wringing your hands over it when my dear the colonel pursued as he smoked have you ever seen anything of yours anything that you ve done not do ah i didn t do this it brought her answer straight i didn t bring her back did you expect her to stay over there all her days to oblige you not a bit for i shouldn t have minded her coming after their marriage it s her coming this way before to which she added with inconsequence i m too sorry for her of course she can t enjoy it but i don t see what perversity rides her she needn t have looked it all so in the face as she doesn t do it i suppose simply for discipline it s almost that s the bore of it discipline to me perhaps then said bob assingham that s what has been her idea take it for god s sake as discipline to you and have done with it it will do he added for discipline to me as well she was far however from having done with it it was a situation with such different sides as she said and to none of which one could in justice be blind it isn t in the least you know for instance that i believe she s bad never never mrs assingham declared i don t think that of her then why isn t that enough nothing was enough mrs assingham signified but that she should develop her thought she doesn t deliberately intend she doesn t consciously wish the least complication it s perfectly true that she thinks maggie a dear as who doesn t she s incapable of any plan to hurt a hair of her head yet here she is and there they are she wound up her husband again for a little smoked in silence what in the world between them ever took place between charlotte and the prince why nothing except their having to recognise that nothing could that was their little romance it was even their little tragedy but what the deuce did they do do they fell in love with each other but seeing it wasn t possible gave each other up then where was the romance why in their frustration in their having the courage to look the facts in the face what facts the colonel went on well to begin with that of their neither of them having the means to marry if she had had even a little a little i mean for two i believe he would bravely have done it after which as her husband but emitted an odd vague sound she corrected herself i mean if he himself had had only a little or a little more than a little a little for a prince they would have done what they could she did them justice if there had been a way but there wasn t a way and charlotte quite to her honour i consider understood it he had to have money it was a question of life and death it wouldn t have been a bit amusing either to marry him as a pauper i mean leaving him one that was what she had as he had the reason to see and their reason is what you call their romance she looked at him a moment what do you want more didn t he the colonel inquired want anything more or didn t for that matter poor charlotte herself she kept her eyes on him there was a manner in it that half answered they were thoroughly in love she might have been his she checked herself she even for a minute lost herself she might have been anything she liked except his wife but she wasn t said the colonel very smokingly she wasn t mrs assingham echoed the echo not loud but deep filled for a little the room he seemed to listen to it die away then he began again how are you sure she waited before saying but when she spoke it was definite there wasn t time he had a small laugh for her reason he might have expected some other does it take so much time she herself however remained serious it takes more than they had he was detached but he wondered what was the matter with their time after which as remembering it all living it over and piecing it together she only considered you mean that you came in with your idea he demanded it brought her quickly to the point and as if also in a measure to answer herself not a bit of it then but you surely recall she went on the way a year ago everything took place they had parted before he had ever heard of maggie why hadn t he heard of her from charlotte herself because she had never spoken of her is that also the colonel inquired what she has told you i m not speaking his wife returned of what she has told me that s one thing i m speaking of what i know by myself that s another you feel in other words that she lies to you bob assingham more sociably asked she neglected the question treating it as gross she never so much at the time as named maggie it was so positive that it appeared to strike him it s he then who has told you she after a moment admitted it it s he and he doesn t lie no to do him justice i believe he absolutely doesn t if i hadn t believed it mrs assingham declared for her general justification i would have had nothing to do with him that is in this connection he s a gentleman i mean all as much of one as he ought to be and he had nothing to gain that helps she added even a gentleman it was i who named maggie to him a year from last may he had never heard of her before then it s grave said the colonel she hesitated do you mean grave for me oh that everything s grave for you is what we take for granted and are fundamentally talking about it s grave it was for charlotte and it s grave for maggie that is it was when he did see her or when she did see him you don t torment me as much as you would like she presently went on because you think of nothing that i haven t a thousand times thought of and because i think of everything that you never will it would all she recognised have been grave if it hadn t all been right you can t make out she contended that we got to rome before the end of february he more than agreed there s nothing in life my dear that i can make out well there was nothing in life apparently that she at real need couldn t charlotte who had been there that year from early quite from november left suddenly you ll quite remember about the th of april she was to have stayed on she was to have stayed naturally more or less for us and she was to have stayed all the more that the ververs due all winter but delayed week after week in paris were at last really coming they were coming that is maggie was largely to see her and above all to be with her there it was all altered by charlotte s going to florence she went from one day to the other you forget everything she gave her reasons but i thought it odd at the time i had a sense that something must have happened the difficulty was that though i knew a little i didn t know enough i didn t know her relation with him had been as you say a near thing that is i didn t know how near the poor girl s departure was a flight she went to save herself he had listened more than he showed as came out in his tone to save herself well also really i think to save him too i saw it afterwards i see it all now he would have been sorry he didn t want to hurt her oh i daresay the colonel laughed they generally don t at all events his wife pursued she escaped they both did for they had had simply to face it their marriage couldn t be and if that was so the sooner they put the apennines between them the better it had taken them it is true some time to feel this and to find it out they had met constantly and not always publicly all that winter they had met more than was known though it was a good deal known more certainly she said than i then imagined though i don t know what difference it would after all have made with me i liked him i thought him charming from the first of our knowing him and now after more than a year he has done nothing to spoil it and there are things he might have done things that many men easily would therefore i believe in him and i was right at first in knowing i was going to so i haven t and she stated it as she might have quoted from a slate after adding up the items the sum of a column of figures so i haven t i say to myself been a fool well are you trying to make out that i ve said you have all their case wants at any rate bob assingham declared is that you should leave it well alone it s theirs now they ve bought it over the counter and paid for it it has ceased to be yours of which case she asked are you speaking he smoked a minute then with a groan lord are there so many there s maggie s and the prince s and there s the prince s and charlotte s oh yes and then the colonel scoffed there s charlotte s and the prince s there s maggie s and charlotte s she went on and there s also maggie s and mine i think too that there s charlotte s and mine yes she mused charlotte s and mine is certainly a case in short you see there are plenty but i mean she said to keep my head are we to settle them all he inquired to night i should lose it if things had happened otherwise if i had acted with any folly she had gone on in her earnestness unheeding of his question i shouldn t be able to bear that now but my good conscience is my strength no one can accuse me the ververs came on to rome alone charlotte after their days with her in florence had decided about america maggie i daresay had helped her she must have made her a present and a handsome one so that many things were easy charlotte left them came to england joined somebody or other sailed for new york i have still her letter from milan telling me i didn t know at the moment all that was behind it but i felt in it nevertheless the undertaking of a new life certainly in any case it cleared that air i mean the dear old roman in which we were steeped it left the field free it gave me a free hand there was no question for me of anybody else when i brought the two others together more than that there was no question for them so you see she concluded where that puts me she got up on the words very much as if they were the blue daylight towards which through a darksome tunnel she had been pushing her way and the elation in her voice combined with her recovered alertness might have signified the sharp whistle of the train that shoots at last into the open she turned about the room she looked out a moment into the august night she stopped here and there before the flowers in bowls and vases yes it was distinctly as if she had proved what was needing proof as if the issue of her operation had been almost unexpectedly a success old arithmetic had perhaps been fallacious but the new settled the question her husband oddly however kept his place without apparently measuring these results as he had been amused at her intensity so he was not uplifted by her relief his interest might in fact have been more enlisted than he allowed do you mean he presently asked that he had already forgot about charlotte she faced round as if he had touched a spring he wanted to naturally and it was much the best thing he could do she was in possession of the main case as it truly seemed she had it all now he was capable of the effort and he took the best way remember too what maggie then seemed to us she s very nice but she always seems to me more than anything else the young woman who has a million a year if you mean that that s what she especially seemed to him you of course place the thing in your light the effort to forget charlotte couldn t i grant you have been so difficult this pulled her up but for an instant i never said he didn t from the first i never said that he doesn t more and more like maggie s money i never said i shouldn t have liked it myself bob assingham returned he made no movement he smoked another minute how much did maggie know how much she seemed to consider as if it were between quarts and gallons how best to express the quantity she knew what charlotte in florence had told her and what had charlotte told her very little what makes you so sure why this that she couldn t tell her and she explained a little what she meant there are things my dear haven t you felt it yourself coarse as you are that no one could tell maggie there are things that upon my word i shouldn t care to attempt to tell her now the colonel smoked on it she d be so scandalised she d be so frightened she d be in her strange little way so hurt she wasn t born to know evil she must never know it bob assingham had a queer grim laugh the sound of which in fact fixed his wife before him we re taking grand ways to prevent it but she stood there to protest we re not taking any ways the ways are all taken they were taken from the moment he came up to our carriage that day in villa borghese the second or third of her days in rome when as you remember you went off somewhere with mr verver and the prince who had got into the carriage with us came home with us to tea they had met they had seen each other well they were in relation the rest was to come of itself and as it could it began practically i recollect in our drive maggie happened to learn by some other man s greeting of him in the bright roman way from a streetcorner as we passed that one of the prince s baptismal names the one always used for him among his relations was amerigo which as you probably don t know however even after a lifetime of me was the name four hundred years ago or whenever of the pushing man who followed across the sea in the wake of columbus and succeeded where columbus had failed in becoming godfather or name father to the new continent so that the thought of any connection with him can even now thrill our artless breasts the colonel s grim placidity could always quite adequately meet his wife s not infrequent imputation of ignorances on the score of the land of her birth unperturbed and unashamed and these dark depths were even at the present moment not directly lighted by an inquiry that managed to be curious without being apologetic but where does the connection come in his wife was prompt by the women that is by some obliging woman of old who was a descendant of the pushing man the make believe discoverer and whom the prince is therefore luckily able to refer to as an ancestress a branch of the other family had become great great enough at least to marry into his and the name of the navigator crowned with glory was very naturally to become so the fashion among them that some son of every generation was appointed to wear it my point is at any rate that i recall noticing at the time how the prince was from the start helped with the dear ververs by his wearing it the connection became romantic for maggie the moment she took it in she filled out in a flash every link that might be vague by that sign i quite said to myself he ll conquer with his good fortune of course of having the other necessary signs too it really said mrs assingham was practically the fine side of the wedge which struck me as also she wound up a lovely note for the candour of the ververs the colonel took in the tale but his comment was prosaic he knew amerigo what he was about and i don t mean the old one i know what you mean his wife bravely threw off the old one he pointed his effect isn t the only discoverer in the family oh as much as you like if he discovered america or got himself honoured as if he had his successors were in due time to discover the americans and it was one of them in particular doubtless who was to discover how patriotic we are wouldn t this be the same one the colonel asked who really discovered what you call the connection she gave him a look the connection s a true thing the connection s perfectly historic your insinuations recoil upon your cynical mind don t you understand she asked that the history of such people is known root and branch at every moment of its course oh it s all right said bob assingham go to the british museum his companion continued with spirit and what am i to do there there s a whole immense room or recess or department or whatever filled with books written about his family alone you can see for yourself have you seen for your self she faltered but an instant certainly i went one day with maggie we looked him up so to say they were most civil and she fell again into the current her husband had slightly ruffled the effect was produced the charm began to work at all events in rome from that hour of the prince s drive with us my only course afterwards had to be to make the best of it it was certainly good enough for that mrs assingham hastened to add and i didn t in the least see my duty in making the worst in the same situation to day i wouldn t act differently i entered into the case as it then appeared to me and as for the matter of that it still does i liked it i thought all sorts of good of it and nothing can even now she said with some intensity make me think anything else nothing can ever make you think anything you don t want to the colonel still in his chair remarked over his pipe you ve got a precious power of thinking whatever you do want you want also from moment to moment to think such desperately different things what happened he went on was that you fell violently in love with the prince yourself and that as you couldn t get me out of the way you had to take some roundabout course you couldn t marry him any more than charlotte could that is not to yourself but you could to somebody else it was always the prince it was always marriage you could to your little friend to whom there were no objections not only there were no objections but there were reasons positive ones and all excellent all charming she spoke with an absence of all repudiation of his exposure of the spring of her conduct and this abstention clearly and effectively conscious evidently cost her nothing it is always the prince and it is always thank heaven marriage and these are the things god grant that it will always be that i could help a year ago most assuredly made me happy and it continues to make me happy then why aren t you quiet i am quiet said fanny assingham he looked at her with his colourless candour still in his place she moved about again a little emphasising by her unrest her declaration of her tranquillity he was as silent at first as if he had taken her answer but he was not to keep it long what do you make of it that by your own show charlotte couldn t tell her all what do you make of it that the prince didn t tell her anything say one understands that there are things she can t be told since as you put it she is so easily scared and shocked he produced these objections slowly giving her time by his pauses to stop roaming and come back to him but she was roaming still when he concluded his inquiry if there hadn t been anything there shouldn t have been between the pair before charlotte bolted in order precisely as you say that there shouldn t be why in the world was what there had been too bad to be spoken of mrs assingham after this question continued still to circulate not directly meeting it even when at last she stopped i thought you wanted me to be quiet so i do and i m trying to make you so much so that you won t worry more can t you be quiet on that she thought a moment then seemed to try to relate that she had to bolt for the reasons we speak of even though the bolting had done for her what she wished that i can perfectly feel charlotte s not wanting to do ah then if it has done for her what she wished but the colonel s conclusion hung by the if which his wife didn t take up so it hung but the longer when he presently spoke again all one wonders in that case is why then she has come back to him say she hasn t come back to him not really to him i ll say anything you like but that won t do me the same good as your saying it nothing my dear will do you good mrs assingham returned you don t care for anything in itself you care for nothing but to be grossly amused because i don t keep washing my hands i thought your whole argument was that everything is so right that this is precisely what you do but his wife as it was a point she had often made could go on as she had gone on before you re perfectly indifferent really you re perfectly immoral you ve taken part in the sack of cities and i m sure you ve done dreadful things yourself but i don t trouble my head if you like so now there she laughed he accepted her laugh but he kept his way well i back poor charlotte back her to know what she wants ah then so do i she does know what she wants and mrs assingham produced this quantity at last on the girl s behalf as the ripe result of her late wanderings and musings she had groped through their talk for the thread and now she had got it she wants to be magnificent she is said the colonel almost cynically she wants his wife now had it fast to be thoroughly superior and she s capable of that of wanting to of carrying out her idea and what is her idea to see maggie through bob assingham wondered through what through everything she knows the prince and maggie doesn t no dear thing mrs assingham had to recognise it she doesn t so that charlotte has come out to give her lessons she continued fanny assingham to work out her thought she has done this great thing for him that is a year ago she practically did it she practically at any rate helped him to do it himself and helped me to help him she kept off she stayed away she left him free and what moreover were her silences to maggie but a direct aid to him if she had spoken in florence if she had told her own poor story if she had come back at any time till within a few weeks ago if she hadn t gone to new york and hadn t held out there if she hadn t done these things all that has happened since would certainly have been different therefore she s in a position to be consistent now she knows the prince mrs assingham repeated it involved even again her former recognition and maggie dear thing doesn t she was high she was lucid she was almost inspired and it was but the deeper drop therefore to her husband s flat common sense in other words maggie is by her ignorance in danger then if she s in danger there is danger there won t be with charlotte s understanding of it that s where she has had her conception of being able to be heroic of being able in fact to be sublime she is she will be the good lady by this time glowed so she sees it to become for her best friend an element of positive safety bob assingham looked at it hard which of them do you call her best friend she gave a toss of impatience i ll leave you to discover but the grand truth thus made out she had now completely adopted it s for us therefore to be hers hers you and i it s for us to be charlotte s it s for us on our side to see her through through her sublimity through her noble lonely life only that s essential it mustn t be lonely it will be all right if she marries so we re to marry her we re to marry her it will be mrs assingham continued the great thing i can do she made it out more and more it will make up make up for what as she said nothing however his desire for lucidity renewed itself if everything s so all right what is there to make up for why if i did do either of them by any chance a wrong if i made a mistake you ll make up for it by making another and then as she again took her time i thought your whole point is just that you re sure one can never be ideally sure of anything there are always possibilities then if we can but strike so wild why keep meddling it made her again look at him where would you have been my dear if i hadn t meddled with you ah that wasn t meddling i was your own i was your own said the colonel from the moment i didn t object well these people won t object they are my own too in the sense that i m awfully fond of them also in the sense she continued that i think they re not so very much less fond of me our relation all round exists it s a reality and a very good one we re mixed up so to speak and it s too late to change it we must live in it and with it therefore to see that charlotte gets a good husband as soon as possible that as i say will be one of my ways of living it will cover she said with conviction all the ground and then as his own conviction appeared to continue as little to match the ground i mean of any nervousness i may ever feel it will be in fact my duty and i shan t rest till my duty s performed she had arrived by this time at something like exaltation i shall give for the next year or two if necessary my life to it i shall have done in that case what i can he took it at last as it came you hold there s no limit to what you can i don t say there s no limit or anything of the sort i say there are good chances enough of them for hope why shouldn t there be when a girl is after all all that she is by after all you mean after she s in love with somebody else the colonel put his question with a quietude doubtless designed to be fatal but it scarcely pulled her up she s not too much in love not herself to want to marry she would now particularly like to has she told you so not yet it s too soon but she will meanwhile however i don t require the information her marrying will prove the truth and what truth the truth of everything i say prove it to whom well to myself to begin with that will be enough for me to work for her what it will prove mrs assingham presently went on will be that she s cured that she accepts the situation he paid this the tribute of a long pull at his pipe the situation of doing the one thing she can that will really seem to cover her tracks his wife looked at him the good dry man as if now at last he was merely vulgar the one thing she can do that will really make new tracks altogether the thing that before any other will be wise and right the thing that will best give her her chance to be magnificent he slowly emitted his smoke and best give you by the same token yours to be magnificent with her i shall be as magnificent at least as i can bob assingham got up and you call me immoral she hesitated i ll call you stupid if you prefer but stupidity pushed to a certain point is you know immorality just so what is morality but high intelligence this he was unable to tell her which left her more definitely to conclude besides it s all at the worst great fun oh if you simply put it at that his implication was that in this case they had a common ground yet even thus he couldn t catch her by it oh i don t mean she said from the threshold the fun that you mean good night in answer to which as he turned out the electric light he gave an odd short groan almost a grunt he had apparently meant some particular kind v well now i must tell you for i want to be absolutely honest so charlotte spoke a little ominously after they had got into the park i don t want to pretend and i can t pretend a moment longer you may think of me what you will but i don t care i knew i shouldn t and i find now how little i came back for this not really for anything else for this she repeated as under the influence of her tone the prince had already come to a pause for this he spoke as if the particular thing she indicated were vague to him or were rather a quantity that couldn t at the most be much it would be as much however as she should be able to make it to have one hour alone with you it had rained heavily in the night and though the pavements were now dry thanks to a cleansing breeze the august morning with its hovering thick drifting clouds and freshened air was cool and grey the multitudinous green of the park had been deepened and a wholesome smell of irrigation purging the place of dust and of odours less acceptable rose from the earth charlotte had looked about her with expression from the first of their coming in quite as if for a deep greeting for general recognition the day was even in the heart of london of a rich low browed weatherwashed english type it was as if it had been waiting for her as if she knew it placed it loved it as if it were in fact a part of what she had come back for so far as this was the case the impression of course could only be lost on a mere vague italian it was one of those for which you had to be blessedly an american as indeed you had to be blessedly an american for all sorts of things so long as you hadn t blessedly or not to remain in america the prince had by half past ten as also by definite appointment called in cadogan place for mrs assingham s visitor and then after brief delay the two had walked together up sloane street and got straight into the park from knightsbridge the understanding to this end had taken its place after a couple of days as inevitably consequent on the appeal made by the girl during those first moments in mrs assingham s drawing room it was an appeal the couple of days had done nothing to invalidate everything much rather to place in a light and as to which obviously it wouldn t have fitted that anyone should raise an objection who was there for that matter to raise one from the moment mrs assingham informed and apparently not disapproving didn t intervene this the young man had asked himself with a very sufficient sense of what would have made him ridiculous he wasn t going to begin that at least was certain by showing a fear even had fear at first been sharp in him moreover it would already not a little have dropped so happy all round so propitious he quite might have called it had been the effect of this rapid interval the time had been taken up largely by his active reception of his own wedding guests and by maggie s scarce less absorbed entertainment of her friend whom she had kept for hours together in portland place whom she had not as wouldn t have been convenient invited altogether as yet to migrate but who had been present with other persons his contingent at luncheon at tea at dinner at perpetual repasts he had never in his life it struck him had to reckon with so much eating whenever he had looked in if he had not again till this hour save for a minute seen charlotte alone so positively all the while he had not seen even maggie and if therefore he had not seen even maggie nothing was more natural than that he shouldn t have seen charlotte the exceptional minute a mere snatch at the tail of the others on the huge portland place staircase had sufficiently enabled the girl to remind him so ready she assumed him to be of what they were to do time pressed if they were to do it at all everyone had brought gifts his relations had brought wonders how did they still have where did they still find such treasures she only had brought nothing and she was ashamed yet even by the sight of the rest of the tribute she wouldn t be put off she would do what she could and he was unknown to maggie he must remember to give her his aid he had prolonged the minute so far as to take time to hesitate for a reason and then to risk bringing his reason out the risk was because he might hurt her hurt her pride if she had that particular sort but she might as well be hurt one way as another and besides that particular sort of pride was just what she hadn t so his slight resistance while they lingered had been just easy enough not to be impossible i hate to encourage you and for such a purpose after all to spend your money she had stood a stair or two below him where while she looked up at him beneath the high domed light of the hall she rubbed with her palm the polished mahogany of the balustrade which was mounted on fine ironwork eighteenth century english because you think i must have so little i ve enough at any rate enough for us to take our hour enough she had smiled is as good as a feast and then she had said it isn t of course a question of anything expensive gorged with treasure as maggie is it isn t a question of competing or outshining what naturally in the way of the priceless hasn t she got mine is to be the offering of the poor something precisely that no rich person could ever give her and that being herself too rich ever to buy it she would therefore never have charlotte had spoken as if after so much thought only as it can t be fine it ought to be funny and that s the sort of thing to hunt for hunting in london besides is amusing in itself he recalled even how he had been struck with her word funny oh i don t mean a comic toy i mean some little thing with a charm but absolutely right in its comparative cheapness that s what i call funny she had explained you used she had also added to help me to get things cheap in rome you were splendid for beating down i have them all still i needn t say the little bargains i there owed you there are bargains in london in august ah but i don t understand your english buying and i confess i find it dull so much as that while they turned to go up together he had objected i understood my poor dear romans it was they who understood you that was your pull she had laughed our amusement here is just that they don t understand us we can make it amusing you ll see if he had hesitated again it was because the point permitted the amusement surely will be to find our present certainly as i say well if they don t come down then we ll come up there s always something to be done besides prince she had gone on i m not if you come to that absolutely a pauper i m too poor for some things she had said yet strange as she was lightly enough but i m not too poor for others and she had paused again at the top i ve been saving up he had really challenged it in america yes even there with my motive and we oughtn t you know she had wound up to leave it beyond to morrow that definitely with ten words more was what had passed he feeling all the while how any sort of begging off would only magnify it he might get on with things as they were but he must do anything rather than magnify besides which it was pitiful to make her beg of him he was making her she had begged and this for a special sensibility in him didn t at all do that was accordingly in fine how they had come to where they were he was engaged as hard as possible in the policy of not magnifying he had kept this up even on her making a point and as if it were almost the whole point that maggie of course was not to have an idea half the interest of the thing at least would be that she shouldn t suspect therefore he was completely to keep it from her as charlotte on her side would that they had been anywhere at all together or had so much as seen each other for five minutes alone the absolute secrecy of their little excursion was in short of the essence she appealed to his kindness to let her feel that he didn t betray her there had been something frankly a little disconcerting in such an appeal at such an hour on the very eve of his nuptials it was one thing to have met the girl casually at mrs assingham s and another to arrange with her thus for a morning practically as private as their old mornings in rome and practically not less intimate he had immediately told maggie the same evening of the minutes that had passed between them in cadogan place though not mentioning those of mrs assingham s absence any more than he mentioned the fact of what their friend had then with such small delay proposed but what had briefly checked his assent to any present to any positive making of mystery what had made him while they stood at the top of the stairs demur just long enough for her to notice it was the sense of the resemblance of the little plan before him to occasions of the past from which he was quite disconnected from which he could only desire to be this was like beginning something over which was the last thing he wanted the strength the beauty of his actual position was in its being wholly a fresh start was that what it began would be new altogether these items of his consciousness had clustered so quickly that by the time charlotte read them in his face he was in presence of what they amounted to she had challenged them as soon as read them had met them with a do you want then to go and tell her that had somehow made them ridiculous it had made him promptly fall back on minimizing it that is on minimizing fuss apparent scruples were obviously fuss and he had on the spot clutched in the light of this truth at the happy principle that would meet every case this principle was simply to be with the girl always simple and with the very last simplicity that would cover everything it had covered then and there certainly his immediate submission to the sight of what was clearest this was really that what she asked was little compared to what she gave what she gave touched him as she faced him for it was the full tune of her renouncing she really renounced renounced everything and without even insisting now on what it had all been for her her only insistence was her insistence on the small matter of their keeping their appointment to themselves that in exchange for everything everything she gave up was verily but a trifle he let himself accordingly be guided he so soon assented for enlightened indulgence to any particular turn she might wish the occasion to take that the stamp of her preference had been well applied to it even while they were still in the park the application in fact presently required that they should sit down a little really to see where they were in obedience to which propriety they had some ten minutes of a quality quite distinct in a couple of penny chairs under one of the larger trees they had taken for their walk to the cropped rain freshened grass after finding it already dry and the chairs turned away from the broad alley the main drive and the aspect of park lane looked across the wide reaches of green which seemed in a manner to refine upon their freedom they helped charlotte thus to make her position her temporary position still more clear and it was for this purpose obviously that abruptly on seeing her opportunity she sat down he stood for a little before her as if to mark the importance of not wasting time the importance she herself had previously insisted on but after she had said a few words it was impossible for him not to resort again to good nature he marked as he could by this concession that if he had finally met her first proposal for what would be amusing in it so any idea she might have would contribute to that effect he had consequently in all consistency to treat it as amusing that she reaffirmed and reaffirmed again the truth that was her truth i don t care what you make of it and i don t ask anything whatever of you anything but this i want to have said it that s all i want not to have failed to say it to see you once and be with you to be as we are now and as we used to be for one small hour or say for two that s what i have had for weeks in my head i mean of course to get it before before what you re going to do so all the while you see she went on with her eyes on him it was a question for me if i should be able to manage it in time if i couldn t have come now i probably shouldn t have come at all perhaps even ever now that i m here i shall stay but there were moments over there when i despaired it wasn t easy there were reasons but it was either this or nothing so i didn t struggle you see in vain after oh i didn t want that i don t mean she smiled that it wouldn t have been delightful to see you even then to see you at any time but i would never have come for it this is different this is what i wanted this is what i ve got this is what i shall always have this is what i should have missed of course she pursued if you had chosen to make me miss it if you had thought me horrid had refused to come i should naturally have been immensely sold i had to take the risk well you re all i could have hoped that s what i was to have said i didn t want simply to get my time with you but i wanted you to know i wanted you she kept it up slowly softly with a small tremor of voice but without the least failure of sense or sequence i wanted you to understand i wanted you that is to hear i don t care i think whether you understand or not if i ask nothing of you i don t i mayn t ask even so much as that what you may think of me that doesn t in the least matter what i want is that it shall always be with you so that you ll never be able quite to get rid of it that i did i won t say that you did you may make as little of that as you like but that i was here with you where we are and as we are i just saying this giving myself in other words away and perfectly willing to do it for nothing that s all she paused as if her demonstration was complete yet for the moment without moving as if in fact to give it a few minutes to sink in into the listening air into the watching space into the conscious hospitality of nature so far as nature was all londonised all vulgarised with them there or even for that matter into her own open ears rather than into the attention of her passive and prudent friend his attention had done all that attention could do his handsome slightly anxious yet still more definitely amused face sufficiently played its part he clutched however at what he could best clutch at the fact that she let him off definitely let him off she let him off it seemed even from so much as answering so that while he smiled back at her in return for her information he felt his lips remain closed to the successive vaguenesses of rejoinder of objection that rose for him from within charlotte herself spoke again at last you may want to know what i get by it but that s my own affair he really didn t want to know even this or continued for the safest plan quite to behave as if he didn t which prolonged the mere dumbness of diversion in which he had taken refuge he was glad when finally the point she had wished to make seeming established to her satisfaction they brought to what might pass for a close the moment of his life at which he had had least to say movement and progress after this with more impersonal talk were naturally a relief so that he was not again during their excursion at a loss for the right word the air had been as it were cleared they had their errand itself to discuss and the opportunities of london the sense of the wonderful place the pleasures of prowling there the question of shops of possibilities of particular objects noticed by each in previous prowls each professed surprise at the extent of the other s knowledge the prince in especial wondered at his friend s possession of her london he had rather prized his own possession the guidance he could really often give a cabman it was a whim of his own a part of his anglomania and congruous with that feature which had after all so much more surface than depth when his companion with the memory of other visits and other rambles spoke of places he hadn t seen and things he didn t know he actually felt again as half the effect just a shade humiliated he might even have felt a trifle annoyed if it hadn t been on this spot for his being even more interested it was a fresh light on charlotte and on her curious world quality of which in rome he had had his due sense but which clearly would show larger on the big london stage rome was in comparison a village a family party a little old world spinnet for the fingers of one hand by the time they reached the marble arch it was almost as if she were showing him a new side and that in fact gave amusement a new and a firmer basis the right tone would be easy for putting himself in her hands should they disagree a little frankly and fairly about directions and chances values and authenticities the situation would be quite gloriously saved they were none the less as happened much of one mind on the article of their keeping clear of resorts with which maggie would be acquainted charlotte recalled it as a matter of course named it in time as a condition they would keep away from any place to which he had already been with maggie this made indeed a scant difference for though he had during the last month done few things so much as attend his future wife on her making of purchases the antiquarii as he called them with charlotte had not been the great affair except in bond street really maggie had had no use for them her situation indeed in connection with that order of traffic was full of consequences produced by her father s mr verver one of the great collectors of the world hadn t left his daughter to prowl for herself he had little to do with shops and was mostly as a purchaser approached privately and from afar great people all over europe sought introductions to him high personages incredibly high and more of them than would ever be known solemnly sworn as everyone was in such cases to discretion high personages made up to him as the one man on the short authentic list likely to give the price it had therefore been easy to settle as they walked that the tracks of the ververs daughter s as well as father s were to be avoided the importance only was that their talk about it led for a moment to the first words they had as yet exchanged on the subject of maggie charlotte still in the park proceeded to them for it was she who began with a serenity of appreciation that was odd certainly as a sequel to her words of ten minutes before this was another note on her what he would have called another light for her companion who though without giving a sign admired for what it was the simplicity of her transition a transition that took no trouble either to trace or to explain itself she paused again an instant on the grass to make it she stopped before him with a sudden anything of course dear as she is will do for her i mean if i were to give her a pin cushion from the baker street bazaar that s exactly what i meant the prince laughed out this allusion to their snatch of talk in portland place it s just what i suggested she took however no notice of the reminder she went on in her own way but it isn t a reason in that case one would never do anything for her i mean charlotte explained if one took advantage of her character of her character we mustn t take advantage of her character the girl again unheeding pursued one mustn t if not for her at least for one s self she saves one such trouble she had spoken thoughtfully with her eyes on her friend s she might have been talking preoccupied and practical of someone with whom he was comparatively unconnected she certainly gives one no trouble said the prince and then as if this were perhaps ambiguous or inadequate she s not selfish god forgive her enough that s what i mean charlotte instantly said she s not selfish enough there s nothing absolutely that one need do for her she s so modest she developed she doesn t miss things i mean if you love her or rather i should say if she loves you she lets it go the prince frowned a little as a tribute after all to seriousness she lets what anything anything that you might do and that you don t she lets everything go but her own disposition to be kind to you it s of herself that she asks efforts so far as she ever has to ask them she hasn t much she does everything herself and that s terrible the prince had listened but always with propriety he didn t commit himself terrible well unless one is almost as good as she it makes too easy terms for one it takes stuff within one so far as one s decency is concerned to stand it and nobody charlotte continued in the same manner is decent enough good enough to stand it not without help from religion or something of that kind not without prayer and fasting that is without taking great care certainly she said such people as you and i are not the prince obligingly thought an instant not good enough to stand it well not good enough not rather to feel the strain we happen each i think to be of the kind that are easily spoiled her friend again for propriety followed the argument oh i don t know may not one s affection for her do something more for one s decency as you call it than her own generosity her own affection her decency has the unfortunate virtue to undo ah of course it must be all in that but she had made her question all the same interesting to him what it comes to one can see what you mean is the way she believes in one that is if she believes at all yes that s what it comes to said charlotte stant and why he asked almost soothingly should it be terrible he couldn t at the worst see that because it s always so the idea of having to pity people not when there s also with it the idea of helping them yes but if we can t help them we can we always can that is he competently added if we care for them and that s what we re talking about yes she on the whole assented it comes back then to our absolutely refusing to be spoiled certainly but everything the prince laughed as they went on all your decency i mean comes back to that she walked beside him a moment it s just what i meant she then reasonably said vi the man in the little shop in which well after this they lingered longest the small but interesting dealer in the bloomsbury street who was remarkable for an insistence not importunate inasmuch as it was mainly mute but singularly intensely coercive this personage fixed on his visitors an extraordinary pair of eyes and looked from one to the other while they considered the object with which he appeared mainly to hope to tempt them they had come to him last for their time was nearly up an hour of it at least from the moment of their getting into a hansom at the marble arch having yielded no better result than the amusement invoked from the first the amusement of course was to have consisted in seeking but it had also involved the idea of finding which latter necessity would have been obtrusive only if they had found too soon the question at present was if they were finding and they put it to each other in the bloomsbury shop while they enjoyed the undiverted attention of the shopman he was clearly the master and devoted to his business the essence of which in his conception might precisely have been this particular secret that he possessed for worrying the customer so little that it fairly made for their relations a sort of solemnity he had not many things none of the redundancy of rot they had elsewhere seen and our friends had on entering even had the sense of a muster so scant that as high values obviously wouldn t reign the effect might be almost pitiful then their impression had changed for though the show was of small pieces several taken from the little window and others extracted from a cupboard behind the counter dusky in the rather low browed place despite its glass doors each bid for their attention spoke however modestly for itself and the pitch of their entertainer s pretensions was promptly enough given his array was heterogeneous and not at all imposing still it differed agreeably from what they had hitherto seen charlotte after the incident was to be full of impressions of several of which later on she gave her companion always in the interest of their amusement the benefit and one of the impressions had been that the man himself was the greatest curiosity they had looked at the prince was to reply to this that he himself hadn t looked at him as precisely in the general connection charlotte had more than once from other days noted for his advantage her consciousness of how below a certain social plane he never saw one kind of shopman was just like another to him which was oddly inconsequent on the part of a mind that where it did notice noticed so much he took throughout always the meaner sort for granted the night of their meanness or whatever name one might give it for him made all his cats grey he didn t no doubt want to hurt them but he imaged them no more than if his eyes acted only for the level of his own high head her own vision acted for every relation this he had seen for himself she remarked beggars she remembered servants she recognised cabmen she had often distinguished beauty when out with him in dirty children she had admired type in faces at hucksters stalls therefore on this occasion she had found their antiquario interesting partly because he cared so for his things and partly because he cared well so for them he likes his things he loves them she was to say and it isn t only it isn t perhaps even at all that he loves to sell them i think he would love to keep them if he could and he prefers at any rate to sell them to right people we clearly were right people he knows them when he sees them and that s why as i say you could make out or at least i could that he cared for us didn t you see she was to ask it with an insistence the way he looked at us and took us in i doubt if either of us have ever been so well looked at before yes he ll remember us she was to profess herself convinced of that almost to uneasiness but it was after all this was perhaps reassuring because given his taste since he has taste he was pleased with us he was struck he had ideas about us well i should think people might we re beautiful aren t we and he knows then also he has his way for that way of saying nothing with his lips when he s all the while pressing you so with his face which shows how he knows you feel it that is a regular way of decent old gold old silver old bronze of old chased and jewelled artistry were the objects that successively produced had ended by numerously dotting the counter where the shopman s slim light fingers with neat nails touched them at moments briefly nervously tenderly as those of a chess player rest a few seconds over the board on a figure he thinks he may move and then may not small florid ancientries ornaments pendants lockets brooches buckles pretexts for dim brilliants bloodless rubies pearls either too large or too opaque for value miniatures mounted with diamonds that had ceased to dazzle snuffboxes presented to or by the too questionable great cups trays taper stands suggestive of pawn tickets archaic and brown that would themselves if preserved have been prized curiosities a few commemorative medals of neat outline but dull reference a classic monument or two things of the first years of the century things consular napoleonic temples obelisks arches tinily re embodied completed the discreet cluster in which however even after tentative reinforcement from several quaint rings intaglios amethysts carbuncles each of which had found a home in the ancient sallow satin of some weakly snapping little box there was in spite of the due proportion of faint poetry no great force of persuasion they looked the visitors they touched they vaguely pretended to consider but with scepticism so far as courtesy permitted in the quality of their attention it was impossible they shouldn t after a little tacitly agree as to the absurdity of carrying to maggie a token from such a stock it would be that was the difficulty pretentious without being good too usual as a treasure to have been an inspiration of the giver and yet too primitive to be taken as tribute welcome on any terms they had been out more than two hours and evidently had found nothing it forced from charlotte a kind of admission it ought really if it should be a thing of this sort to take its little value from having belonged to one s self ecco said the prince just triumphantly enough there you are behind the dealer were sundry small cupboards in the wall two or three of these charlotte had seen him open so that her eyes found themselves resting on those he had not visited but she completed her admission there s nothing here she could wear it was only after a moment that her companion rejoined is there anything do you think that you could it made her just start she didn t at all events look at the objects she but looked for an instant very directly at him no ah the prince quietly exclaimed would it be charlotte asked your idea to offer me something well why not as a small ricordo but a ricordo of what why of this as you yourself say of this little hunt oh i say it but hasn t my whole point been that i don t ask you to therefore she demanded but smiling at him now where s the logic oh the logic he laughed but logic s everything that at least is how i feel it a ricordo from you from you to me is a ricordo of nothing it has no reference ah my dear he vaguely protested their entertainer meanwhile stood there with his eyes on them and the girl though at this minute more interested in her passage with her friend than in anything else again met his gaze it was a comfort to her that their foreign tongue covered what they said and they might have appeared of course as the prince now had one of the snuffboxes in his hand to be discussing a purchase you don t refer she went on to her companion i refer he had lifted the lid of his little box and he looked into it hard do you mean by that then that you would be free free to offer me something this gave her a longer pause and when she spoke again she might have seemed oddly to be addressing the dealer would you allow me no said the prince into his little box you wouldn t accept it from me no he repeated in the same way she exhaled a long breath that was like a guarded sigh but you ve touched an idea that has been mine it s what i ve wanted then she added it was what i hoped he put down his box this had drawn his eyes he made nothing clearly of the little man s attention it s what you brought me out for well that s at any rate she returned my own affair but it won t do it won t do cara mia it s impossible it s impossible and he took up one of the brooches she had another pause while the shopman only waited if i were to accept from you one of these charming little ornaments as you suggest what should i do with it he was perhaps at last a little irritated he even as if he might understand looked vaguely across at their host wear it per bacco where then please under my clothes wherever you like but it isn t then if you will he added worth talking about it s only worth talking about mio caro she smiled from your having begun it my question is only reasonable so that your idea may stand or fall by your answer to it if i should pin one of these things on for you would it be to your mind that i might go home and show it to maggie as your present they had had between them often in talk the refrain jocosely descriptively applied of old roman it had been as a pleasantry in the other time his explanation to her of everything but nothing truly had even seemed so old roman as the shrug in which he now indulged why in the world not because on our basis it would be impossible to give her an account of the pretext the pretext he wondered the occasion this ramble that we shall have had together and that we re not to speak of oh yes he said after a moment i remember we re not to speak of it that of course you re pledged to and the one thing you see goes with the other so you don t insist he had again at random laid back his trinket with which he quite turned to her a little wearily at last even a little impatiently i don t insist it disposed for the time of the question but what was next apparent was that it had seen them no further the shopman who had not stirred stood there in his patience which his mute intensity helping had almost the effect of an ironic comment the prince moved to the glass door and his back to the others as with nothing more to contribute looked though not less patiently into the street then the shopman for charlotte momentously broke silence you ve seen disgraziatamente signora principessa he sadly said too much and it made the prince face about for the effect of the momentous came if not from the sense from the sound of his words which was that of the suddenest sharpest italian charlotte exchanged with her friend a glance that matched it and just for the minute they were held in check but their glance had after all by that time said more than one thing had both exclaimed on the apprehension by the wretch of their intimate conversation let alone of her possible her impossible title and remarked for mutual reassurance that it didn t all the same matter the prince remained by the door but immediately addressing the speaker from where he stood you re italian then are you but the reply came in english oh dear no you re english to which the answer was this time with a smile in briefest italian che the dealer waived the question he practically disposed of it by turning straightway toward a receptacle to which he had not yet resorted and from which after unlocking it he extracted a square box of some twenty inches in height covered with worn looking leather he placed the box on the counter pushed back a pair of small hooks lifted the lid and removed from its nest a drinking vessel larger than a common cup yet not of exorbitant size and formed to appearance either of old fine gold or of some material once richly gilt he handled it with tenderness with ceremony making a place for it on a small satin mat my golden bowl he observed and it sounded on his lips as if it said everything he left the important object for as important it did somehow present itself to produce its certain effect simple but singularly elegant it stood on a circular foot a short pedestal with a slightly spreading base and though not of signal depth justified its title by the charm of its shape as well as by the tone of its surface it might have been a large goblet diminished to the enhancement of its happy curve by half its original height as formed of solid gold it was impressive it seemed indeed to warn off the prudent admirer charlotte with care immediately took it up while the prince who had after a minute shifted his position again regarded it from a distance it was heavier than charlotte had thought gold really gold she asked of their companion he hesitated look a little and perhaps you ll make out she looked holding it up in both her fine hands turning it to the light it may be cheap for what it is but it will be dear i m afraid for me well said the man i can part with it for less than its value i got it you see for less for how much then again he waited always with his serene stare do you like it then charlotte turned to her friend do you like it he came no nearer he looked at their companion cos e well signori miei if you must know it s just a perfect crystal of course we must know per dio said the prince but he turned away again he went back to his glass door charlotte set down the bowl she was evidently taken do you mean it s cut out of a single crystal if it isn t i think i can promise you that you ll never find any joint or any piecing she wondered even if i were to scrape off the gold he showed though with due respect that she amused him you couldn t scrape it off it has been too well put on put on i don t know when and i don t know how but by some very fine old worker and by some beautiful old process charlotte frankly charmed with the cup smiled back at him now a lost art call it a lost art but of what time then is the whole thing well say also of a lost time the girl considered then if it s so precious how comes it to be cheap her interlocutor once more hung fire but by this time the prince had lost patience i ll wait for you out in the air he said to his companion and though he spoke without irritation he pointed his remark by passing immediately into the street where during the next minutes the others saw him his back to the shopwindow philosophically enough hover and light a fresh cigarette charlotte even took a little her time she was aware of his funny italian taste for london street life her host meanwhile at any rate answered her question ah i ve had it a long time without selling it i think i must have been keeping it madam for you you ve kept it for me because you ve thought i mightn t see what s the matter with it he only continued to face her he only continued to appear to follow the play of her mind what is the matter with it oh it s not for me to say it s for you honestly to tell me of course i know something must be but if it s something you can t find out isn t it as good as if it were nothing i probably should find out as soon as i had paid for it not her host lucidly insisted if you hadn t paid too much what do you call she asked little enough well what should you say to fifteen pounds i should say said charlotte with the utmost promptitude that it s altogether too much the dealer shook his head slowly and sadly but firmly it s my price madam and if you admire the thing i think it really might be yours it s not too much it s too little it s almost nothing i can t go lower charlotte wondering but resisting bent over the bowl again then it s impossible it s more than i can afford ah the man returned one can sometimes afford for a present more than one can afford for one s self he said it so coaxingly that she found herself going on without as might be said putting him in his place oh of course it would be only for a present then it would be a lovely one does one make a present she asked of an object that contains to one s knowledge a flaw well if one knows of it one has only to mention it the good faith the man smiled is always there and leave the person to whom one gives the thing you mean to discover it he wouldn t discover it if you re speaking of a gentleman i m not speaking of anyone in particular charlotte said well whoever it might be he might know and he might try but he wouldn t find she kept her eyes on him as if though unsatisfied mystified she yet had a fancy for the bowl not even if the thing should come to pieces and then as he was silent not even if he should have to say to me the golden bowl is broken he was still silent after which he had his strangest smile ah if anyone should want to smash it she laughed she almost admired the little man s expression you mean one could smash it with a hammer yes if nothing else would do or perhaps even by dashing it with violence say upon a marble floor oh marble floors but she might have been thinking for they were a connection marble floors a connection with many things with her old rome and with his with the palaces of his past and a little of hers with the possibilities of his future with the sumptuosities of his marriage with the wealth of the ververs all the same however there were other things and they all together held for a moment her fancy does crystal then break when it is crystal i thought its beauty was its hardness her friend in his way discriminated its beauty is its being crystal but its hardness is certainly its safety it doesn t break he went on like vile glass it splits if there is a split ah charlotte breathed with interest if there is a split and she looked down again at the bowl there is a split eh crystal does split eh on lines and by laws of its own you mean if there s a weak place for all answer after an hesitation he took the bowl up again holding it aloft and tapping it with a key it rang with the finest sweetest sound where is the weak place she then did the question justice well for me only the price i m poor you see very poor but i thank you and i ll think the prince on the other side of the shop window had finally faced about and as to see if she hadn t done was trying to reach with his eyes the comparatively dim interior i like it she said i want it but i must decide what i can do the man not ungraciously resigned himself well i ll keep it for you the small quarter of an hour had had its marked oddity this she felt even by the time the open air and the bloomsbury aspects had again in their protest against the truth of her gathered impression made her more or less their own yet the oddity might have been registered as small as compared to the other effect that before they had gone much further she had with her companion to take account of this latter was simply the effect of their having by some tacit logic some queer inevitability quite dropped the idea of a continued pursuit they didn t say so but it was on the line of giving up maggie s present that they practically proceeded the line of giving it up without more reference to it the prince s first reference was in fact quite independently made i hope you satisfied yourself before you had done of what was the matter with that bowl no indeed i satisfied myself of nothing of nothing at least but that the more i looked at it the more i liked it and that if you weren t so unaccommodating this would be just the occasion for your giving me the pleasure of accepting it he looked graver for her at this than he had looked all the morning do you propose it seriously without wishing to play me a trick she wondered what trick would it be he looked at her harder you mean you really don t know but know what why what s the matter with it you didn t see all the while she only continued however to stare how could you see out in the street i saw before i went out it was because i saw that i did go out i didn t want to have another scene with you before that rascal and i judged you would presently guess for yourself is he a rascal charlotte asked his price is so moderate she waited but a moment five pounds really so little five pounds he continued to look at her five pounds he might have been doubting her word but he was only it appeared gathering emphasis it would be dear to make a gift of at five shillings if it had cost you even but five pence i wouldn t take it from you then she asked what is the matter why it has a crack it sounded on his lips so sharp it had such an authority that she almost started while her colour at the word rose it was as if he had been right though his assurance was wonderful you answer for it without having looked i did look i saw the object itself it told its story no wonder it s cheap but it s exquisite charlotte as if with an interest in it now made even tenderer and stranger found herself moved to insist of course it s exquisite that s the danger then a light visibly came to her a light in which her friend suddenly and intensely showed the reflection of it as she smiled at him was in her own face the danger i see is because you re superstitious per dio i m superstitious a crack is a crack and an omen s an omen you d be afraid per bacco for your happiness for my happiness for your safety for my safety she just paused for your marriage for my marriage for everything she thought again thank goodness then that if there be a crack we know it but if we may perish by cracks in things that we don t know and she smiled with the sadness of it we can never then give each other anything he considered but he met it ah but one does know i do at least and by instinct i don t fail that will always protect me it was funny the way he said such things yet she liked him really the more for it they fell in for her with a general or rather with a special vision but she spoke with a mild despair what then will protect me where i m concerned i will from me at least you ve nothing to fear he now quite amiably responded anything you consent to accept from me but he paused well well shall be perfect that s very fine she presently answered it s vain after all for you to talk of my accepting things when you ll accept nothing from me ah there better still he could meet her you attach an impossible condition that i mean of my keeping your gift so to myself well she looked before him there at the condition then abruptly with a gesture she gave it up she had a headshake of disenchantment so far as the idea had appealed to her it all appeared too difficult oh my condition i don t hold to it you may cry it on the housetops anything i ever do ah well then this made he laughed all the difference but it was too late oh i don t care now i should have liked the bowl but if that won t do there s nothing he considered this he took it in looking graver again but after a moment he qualified yet i shall want some day to give you something she wondered at him what day the day you marry for you will marry you must seriously marry she took it from him but it determined in her the only words she was to have uttered all the morning that came out as if a spring had been pressed to make you feel better well he replied frankly wonderfully it will but here he added is your hansom he had signalled the cab was charging she put out no hand for their separation but she prepared to get in before she did so however she said what had been gathering while she waited well i would marry i think to have something from you in all freedom part second vii adam verver at fawns that autumn sunday might have been observed to open the door of the billiard room with a certain freedom might have been observed that is had there been a spectator in the field the justification of the push he had applied however and of the push equally sharp that to shut himself in he again applied the ground of this energy was precisely that he might here however briefly find himself alone alone with the handful of letters newspapers and other unopened missives to which during and since breakfast he had lacked opportunity to give an eye the vast square clean apartment was empty and its large clear windows looked out into spaces of terrace and garden of park and woodland and shining artificial lake of richly condensed horizon all dark blue upland and church towered village and strong cloudshadow which were together a thing to create the sense with everyone else at church of one s having the world to one s self we share this world none the less for the hour with mr verver the very fact of his striking as he would have said for solitude the fact of his quiet flight almost on tiptoe through tortuous corridors investing him with an interest that makes our attention tender indeed almost to compassion qualify his achieved isolation for it may immediately be mentioned that this amiable man bethought himself of his personal advantage in general only when it might appear to him that other advantages those of other persons had successfully put in their claim it may be mentioned also that he always figured other persons such was the law of his nature as a numerous array and that though conscious of but a single near tie one affection one duty deepest rooted in his life it had never for many minutes together been his portion not to feel himself surrounded and committed never quite been his refreshment to make out where the many coloured human appeal represented by gradations of tint diminishing concentric zones of intensity of importunity really faded to the blessed impersonal whiteness for which his vision sometimes ached it shaded off the appeal he would have admitted that but he had as yet noted no point at which it positively stopped thus had grown in him a little habit his innermost secret not confided even to maggie though he felt she understood it as she understood to his view everything thus had shaped itself the innocent trick of occasionally making believe that he had no conscience or at least that blankness in the field of duty did reign for an hour a small game to which the few persons near enough to have caught him playing it and of whom mrs assingham for instance was one attached indulgently that idea of quaintness quite in fact that charm of the pathetic involved in the preservation by an adult of one of childhood s toys when he took a rare moment off he did so with the touching confessing eyes of a man of forty seven caught in the act of handling a relic of infancy sticking on the head of a broken soldier or trying the lock of a wooden gun it was essentially in him the imitation of depravity which for amusement as might have been he practised keeping up in spite of practice he was still imperfect for these so artlessly artful interludes were condemned by the nature of the case to brevity he had fatally stamped himself it was his own fault a man who could be interrupted with impunity the greatest of wonders moreover was exactly in this that so interrupted a man should ever have got as the phrase was should above all have got so early to where he was it argued a special genius he was clearly a case of that the spark of fire the point of light sat somewhere in his inward vagueness as a lamp before a shrine twinkles in the dark perspective of a church and while youth and early middle age while the stiff american breeze of example and opportunity were blowing upon it hard had made of the chamber of his brain a strange workshop of fortune this establishment mysterious and almost anonymous the windows of which at hours of highest pressure never seemed for starers and wonderers perceptibly to glow must in fact have been during certain years the scene of an unprecedented a miraculous white heat the receipt for producing which it was practically felt that the master of the forge could not have communicated even with the best intentions the essential pulse of the flame the very action of the cerebral temperature brought to the highest point yet extraordinarily contained these facts themselves were the immensity of the result they were one with perfection of machinery they had constituted the kind of acquisitive power engendered and applied the necessary triumph of all operations a dim explanation of phenomena once vivid must at all events for the moment suffice us it being obviously no account of the matter to throw on our friend s amiability alone the weight of the demonstration of his economic history amiability of a truth is an aid to success it has even been known to be the principle of large accumulations but the link for the mind is none the less fatally missing between proof on such a scale of continuity if of nothing more insolent in one field and accessibility to distraction in every other variety of imagination what is that but fatal in the world of affairs unless so disciplined as not to be distinguished from monotony mr verver then for a fresh full period a period betraying extraordinarily no wasted year had been inscrutably monotonous behind an iridescent cloud the cloud was his native envelope the soft looseness so to say of his temper and tone not directly expressive enough no doubt to figure an amplitude of folds but of a quality unmistakable for sensitive feelers he was still reduced in fine to getting his rare moments with himself by feigning a cynicism his real inability to maintain the pretence however had perhaps not often been better instanced than by his acceptance of the inevitable to day his acceptance of it on the arrival at the end of a quarter of an hour of that element of obligation with which he had all the while known he must reckon a quarter of an hour of egoism was about as much as he taking one situation with another usually got mrs rance opened the door more tentatively indeed than he himself had just done but on the other hand as if to make up for this she pushed forward even more briskly on seeing him than he had been moved to do on seeing nobody then with force it came home to him that he had definitely a week before established a precedent he did her at least that justice it was a kind of justice he was always doing someone he had on the previous sunday liked to stop at home and he had exposed himself thereby to be caught in the act to make this possible that is mrs rance had only had to like to do the same the trick was so easily played it had not occurred to him to plan in any way for her absence which would have destroyed somehow in principle the propriety of his own presence if persons under his roof hadn t a right not to go to church what became for a fair mind of his own right his subtlest manoeuvre had been simply to change from the library to the billiard room it being in the library that his guest or his daughter s or the guest of the miss lutches he scarce knew in which light to regard her had then and not unnaturally of course joined him it was urged on him by his memory of the duration of the visit she had that time as it were paid him that the law of recurrence would already have got itself enacted she had spent the whole morning with him was still there in the library when the others came back thanks to her having been tepid about their taking mr verver and she a turn outside it had been as if she looked on that as a kind of subterfuge almost as a form of disloyalty yet what was it she had in mind what did she wish to make of him beyond what she had already made a patient punctilious host mindful that she had originally arrived much as a stranger arrived not at all deliberately or yearningly invited so that one positively had her possible susceptibilities the more on one s conscience the miss lutches the sisters from the middle west were there as friends of maggie s friends of the earlier time but mrs rance was there or at least had primarily appeared only as a friend of the miss lutches this lady herself was not of the middle west she rather insisted on it but of new jersey rhode island or delaware one of the smallest and most intimate states he couldn t remember which though she insisted too on that it was not in him we may say it for him to go so far as to wonder if their group were next to be recruited by some friend of her own and this partly because she had struck him verily rather as wanting to get the miss lutches themselves away than to extend the actual circle and partly as well as more essentially because such connection as he enjoyed with the ironic question in general resided substantially less in a personal use of it than in the habit of seeing it as easy to others he was so framed by nature as to be able to keep his inconveniences separate from his resentments though indeed if the sum of these latter had at the most always been small that was doubtless in some degree a consequence of the fewness of the former his greatest inconvenience he would have admitted had he analyzed was in finding it so taken for granted that as he had money he had force it pressed upon him hard and all round assuredly this attribution of power everyone had need of one s power whereas one s own need at the best would have seemed to be but some trick for not communicating it the effect of a reserve so merely so meanly defensive would in most cases beyond question sufficiently discredit the cause wherefore though it was complicating to be perpetually treated as an infinite agent the outrage was not the greatest of which a brave man might complain complaint besides was a luxury and he dreaded the imputation of greed the other the constant imputation that of being able to do would have no ground if he hadn t been to start with this was the point provably luxurious his lips somehow were closed and by a spring connected moreover with the action of his eyes themselves the latter showed him what he had done showed him where he had come out quite at the top of his hill of difficulty the tall sharp spiral round which he had begun to wind his ascent at the age of twenty and the apex of which was a platform looking down if one would on the kingdoms of the earth and with standing room for but half a dozen others his eyes in any case now saw mrs rance approach with an instant failure to attach to the fact any grossness of avidity of mrs rance s own or at least to descry any triumphant use even for the luridest impression of her intensity what was virtually supreme would be her vision of his having attempted by his desertion of the library to mislead her which in point of fact barely escaped being what he had designed it was not easy for him in spite of accumulations fondly and funnily regarded as of systematic practice not now to be ashamed the one thing comparatively easy would be to gloss over his course the billiard room was not at the particular crisis either a natural or a graceful place for the nominally main occupant of so large a house to retire to and this without prejudice either to the fact that his visitor wouldn t as he apprehended explicitly make him a scene should she frankly denounce him for a sneak he would simply go to pieces but he was after an instant not afraid of that wouldn t she rather as emphasising their communion accept and in a manner exploit the anomaly treat it perhaps as romantic or possibly even as comic show at least that they needn t mind even though the vast table draped in brown holland thrust itself between them as an expanse of desert sand she couldn t cross the desert but she could and did beautifully get round it so that for him to convert it into an obstacle he would have had to cause himself as in some childish game or unbecoming romp to be pursued to be genially hunted this last was a turn he was well aware the occasion should on no account take and there loomed before him for the mere moment the prospect of her fairly proposing that they should knock about the balls that danger certainly it struck him he should manage in some way to deal with why too for that matter had he need of defences material or other how was it a question of dangers really to be called such the deep danger the only one that made him as an idea positively turn cold would have been the possibility of her seeking him in marriage of her bringing up between them that terrible issue here fortunately she was powerless it being apparently so provable against her that she had a husband in undiminished existence she had him it was true only in america only in texas in nebraska in arizona or somewhere somewhere that at old fawns house in the county of kent scarcely counted as a definite place at all it showed somehow from afar as so lost so indistinct and illusory in the great alkali desert of cheap divorce she had him even in bondage poor man had him in contempt had him in remembrance so imperfect as barely to assert itself but she had him none the less in existence unimpeached the miss lutches had seen him in the flesh as they had appeared eager to mention though when they were separately questioned their descriptions failed to tally he would be at the worst should it come to the worst mrs rance s difficulty and he served therefore quite enough as the stout bulwark of anyone else this was in truth logic without a flaw yet it gave mr verver less comfort than it ought he feared not only danger he feared the idea of danger or in other words feared hauntedly himself it was above all as a symbol that mrs rance actually rose before him a symbol of the supreme effort that he should have sooner or later as he felt to make this effort would be to say no he lived in terror of having to he should be proposed to at a given moment it was only a question of time and then he should have to do a thing that would be extremely disagreeable he almost wished on occasion that he wasn t so sure he would do it he knew himself however well enough not to doubt he knew coldly quite bleakly where he would at the crisis draw the line it was maggie s marriage and maggie s finer happiness happy as he had supposed her before that had made the difference he hadn t in the other time it now seemed to him had to think of such things they hadn t come up for him and it was as if she positively had herself kept them down she had only been his child which she was indeed as much as ever but there were sides on which she had protected him as if she were more than a daughter she had done for him more than he knew much and blissfully as he always had known if she did at present more than ever through having what she called the change in his life to make up to him for his situation still all the same kept pace with her activity his situation being simply that there was more than ever to be done there had not yet been quite so much on all the showing as since their return from their twenty months in america as since their settlement again in england experimental though it was and the consequent sense now quite established for him of a domestic air that had cleared and lightened producing the effect for their common personal life of wider perspectives and large waiting spaces it was as if his son in law s presence even from before his becoming his son in law had somehow filled the scene and blocked the future very richly and handsomely when all was said not at all inconveniently or in ways not to have been desired inasmuch as though the prince his measure now practically taken was still pretty much the same big fact the sky had lifted the horizon receded the very foreground itself expanded quite to match him quite to keep everything in comfortable scale at first certainly their decent little old time union maggie s and his own had resembled a good deal some pleasant public square in the heart of an old city into which a great palladian church say something with a grand architectural front had suddenly been dropped so that the rest of the place the space in front the way round outside to the east end the margin of street and passage the quantity of over arching heaven had been temporarily compromised not even then of a truth in a manner disconcerting given that is for the critical or at least the intelligent eye the great style of the facade and its high place in its class the phenomenon that had since occurred whether originally to have been pronounced calculable or not had not naturally been the miracle of a night but had taken place so gradually quietly easily that from this vantage of wide wooded fawns with its eighty rooms as they said with its spreading park with its acres and acres of garden and its majesty of artificial lake though that for a person so familiar with the great ones might be rather ridiculous no visibility of transition showed no violence of adjustment in retrospect emerged the palladian church was always there but the piazza took care of itself the sun stared down in his fulness the air circulated and the public not less the limit stood off the way round was easy the east end was as fine in its fashion as the west and there were also side doors for entrance between the two large monumental ornamental in their style as for all proper great churches by some such process in fine had the prince for his father in law while remaining solidly a feature ceased to be at all ominously a block mr verver it may further be mentioned had taken at no moment sufficient alarm to have kept in detail the record of his reassurance but he would none the less not have been unable not really have been indisposed to impart in confidence to the right person his notion of the history of the matter the right person it is equally distinct had not for this illumination been wanting but had been encountered in the form of fanny assingham not for the first time indeed admitted to his counsels and who would have doubtless at present in any case from plenitude of interest and with equal guarantees repeated his secret it all came then the great clearance from the one prime fact that the prince by good fortune hadn t proved angular he clung to that description of his daughter s husband as he often did to terms and phrases in the human the social connection that he had found for himself it was his way to have times of using these constantly as if they just then lighted the world or his own path in it for him even when for some of his interlocutors they covered less ground it was true that with mrs assingham he never felt quite sure of the ground anything covered she disputed with him so little agreed with him so much surrounded him with such systematic consideration such predetermined tenderness that it was almost which he had once told her in irritation as if she were nursing a sick baby he had accused her of not taking him seriously and she had replied as from her it couldn t frighten him that she took him religiously adoringly she had laughed again as she had laughed before on his producing for her that good right word about the happy issue of his connection with the prince with an effect the more odd perhaps as she had not contested its value she couldn t of course however be at the best as much in love with his discovery as he was himself he was so much so that he fairly worked it to his own comfort came in fact sometimes near publicly pointing the moral of what might have occurred if friction so to speak had occurred he pointed it frankly one day to the personage in question mentioned to the prince the particular justice he did him was even explicit as to the danger that in their remarkable relation they had thus escaped oh if he had been angular who could say what might then have happened he spoke and it was the way he had spoken to mrs assingham too as if he grasped the facts without exception for which angularity stood it figured for him clearly as a final idea a conception of the last vividness he might have been signifying by it the sharp corners and hard edges all the stony pointedness the grand right geometry of his spreading palladian church just so he was insensible to no feature of the felicity of a contact that beguilingly almost confoundingly was a contact but with practically yielding lines and curved surfaces you re round my boy he had said you re all you re variously and inexhaustibly round when you might by all the chances have been abominably square i m not sure for that matter he had added that you re not square in the general mass whether abominably or not the abomination isn t a question for you re inveterately round that s what i mean in the detail it s the sort of thing in you that one feels or at least i do with one s hand say you had been formed all over in a lot of little pyramidal lozenges like that wonderful side of the ducal palace in venice so lovely in a building but so damnable for rubbing against in a man and especially in a near relation i can see them all from here each of them sticking out by itself all the architectural cut diamonds that would have scratched one s softer sides one would have been scratched by diamonds doubtless the neatest way if one was to be scratched at all but one would have been more or less reduced to a hash as it is for living with you re a pure and perfect crystal i give you my idea i think you ought to have it just as it has come to me the prince had taken the idea in his way for he was well accustomed by this time to taking and nothing perhaps even could more have confirmed mr verver s account of his surface than the manner in which these golden drops evenly flowed over it they caught in no interstice they gathered in no concavity the uniform smoothness betrayed the dew but by showing for the moment a richer tone the young man in other words unconfusedly smiled though indeed as if assenting from principle and habit to more than he understood he liked all signs that things were well but he cared rather less why they were in regard to the people among whom he had since his marriage been living the reasons they so frequently gave so much oftener than he had ever heard reasons given before remained on the whole the element by which he most differed from them and his father in law and his wife were after all only first among the people among whom he had been living he was never even yet sure of how at this that or the other point he would strike them they felt remarkably so often things he hadn t meant and missed not less remarkably and not less often things he had he had fallen back on his general explanation we haven t the same values by which he understood the same measure of importance his curves apparently were important because they had been unexpected or still more unconceived whereas when one had always as in his relegated old world taken curves and in much greater quantities too for granted one was no more surprised at the resulting feasibility of intercourse than one was surprised at being upstairs in a house that had a staircase he had in fact on this occasion disposed alertly enough of the subject of mr verver s approbation the promptitude of his answer we may in fact well surmise had sprung not a little from a particular kindled remembrance this had given his acknowledgment its easiest turn oh if i m a crystal i m delighted that i m a perfect one for i believe that they sometimes have cracks and flaws in which case they re to be had very cheap he had stopped short of the emphasis it would have given his joke to add that there had been certainly no having him cheap and it was doubtless a mark of the good taste practically reigning between them that mr verver had not on his side either taken up the opportunity it is the latter s relation to such aspects however that now most concerns us and the bearing of his pleased view of this absence of friction upon amerigo s character as a representative precious object representative precious objects great ancient pictures and other works of art fine eminent pieces in gold in silver in enamel majolica ivory bronze had for a number of years so multiplied themselves round him and as a general challenge to acquisition and appreciation so engaged all the faculties of his mind that the instinct the particular sharpened appetite of the collector had fairly served as a basis for his acceptance of the prince s suit over and above the signal fact of the impression made on maggie herself the aspirant to his daughter s hand showed somehow the great marks and signs stood before him with the high authenticities he had learned to look for in pieces of the first order adam verver knew by this time knew thoroughly no man in europe or in america he privately believed was less capable in such estimates of vulgar mistakes he had never spoken of himself as infallible it was not his way but apart from the natural affections he had acquainted himself with no greater joy of the intimately personal type than the joy of his originally coming to feel and all so unexpectedly that he had in him the spirit of the connoisseur he had like many other persons in the course of his reading been struck with keats s sonnet about stout cortez in the presence of the pacific but few persons probably had so devoutly fitted the poet s grand image to a fact of experience it consorted so with mr verver s consciousness of the way in which at a given moment he had stared at his pacific that a couple of perusals of the immortal lines had sufficed to stamp them in his memory his peak in darien was the sudden hour that had transformed his life the hour of his perceiving with a mute inward gasp akin to the low moan of apprehensive passion that a world was left him to conquer and that he might conquer it if he tried it had been a turning of the page of the book of life as if a leaf long inert had moved at a touch and eagerly reversed had made such a stir of the air as sent up into his face the very breath of the golden isles to rifle the golden isles had on the spot become the business of his future and with the sweetness of it what was most wondrous of all still more even in the thought than in the act the thought was that of the affinity of genius or at least of taste with something in himself with the dormant intelligence of which he had thus almost violently become aware and that affected him as changing by a mere revolution of the screw his whole intellectual plane he was equal somehow with the great seers the invokers and encouragers of beauty and he didn t after all perhaps dangle so far below the great producers and creators he had been nothing of that kind before too decidedly too dreadfully not but now he saw why he had been what he had why he had failed and fallen short even in huge success now he read into his career in one single magnificent night the immense meaning it had waited for it was during his first visit to europe after the death of his wife when his daughter was ten years old that the light in his mind had so broken and he had even made out at that time why on an earlier occasion the journey of his honeymoon year it had still been closely covered he had bought then so far as he had been able but he had bought almost wholly for the frail fluttered creature at his side who had had her fancies decidedly but all for the art then wonderful to both of them of the rue de la paix the costly authenticities of dressmakers and jewellers her flutter pale disconcerted ghost as she actually was a broken white flower tied round almost grotesquely for his present sense with a huge satin bow of the boulevard her flutter had been mainly that of ribbons frills and fine fabrics all funny pathetic evidence for memory of the bewilderments overtaking them as a bridal pair confronted with opportunity he could wince fairly still as he remembered the sense in which the poor girl s pressure had under his fond encouragement indeed been exerted in favour of purchase and curiosity these were wandering images out of the earlier dusk that threw her back for his pity into a past more remote than he liked their common past their young affection to appear it would have had to be admitted to an insistent criticism that maggie s mother all too strangely had not so much failed of faith as of the right application of it since she had exercised it eagerly and restlessly made it a pretext for innocent perversities in respect to which philosophic time was at last to reduce all groans to gentleness and they had loved each other so that his own intelligence on the higher line had temporarily paid for it the futilities the enormities the depravities of decoration and ingenuity that before his sense was unsealed she had made him think lovely musing reconsidering little man that he was and addicted to silent pleasures as he was accessible to silent pains he even sometimes wondered what would have become of his intelligence in the sphere in which it was to learn more and more exclusively to play if his wife s influence upon it had not been in the strange scheme of things so promptly removed would she have led him altogether attached as he was to her into the wilderness of mere mistakes would she have prevented him from ever scaling his vertiginous peak or would she otherwise have been able to accompany him to that eminence where he might have pointed out to her as cortez to his companions the revelation vouchsafed no companion of cortez had presumably been a real lady mr verver allowed that historic fact to determine his inference viii what was at all events not permanently hidden from him was a truth much less invidious about his years of darkness it was the strange scheme of things again the years of darkness had been needed to render possible the years of light a wiser hand than he at first knew had kept him hard at acquisition of one sort as a perfect preliminary to acquisition of another and the preliminary would have been weak and wanting if the good faith of it had been less his comparative blindness had made the good faith which in its turn had made the soil propitious for the flower of the supreme idea he had had to like forging and sweating he had had to like polishing and piling up his arms they were things at least he had had to believe he liked just as he had believed he liked transcendent calculation and imaginative gambling all for themselves the creation of interests that were the extinction of other interests the livid vulgarity even of getting in or getting out first that had of course been so far from really the case with the supreme idea all the while growing and striking deep under everything in the warm rich earth he had stood unknowing he had walked and worked where it was buried and the fact itself the fact of his fortune would have been a barren fact enough if the first sharp tender shoot had never struggled into day there on one side was the ugliness his middle time had been spared there on the other from all the portents was the beauty with which his age might still be crowned he was happier doubtless than he deserved but that when one was happy at all it was easy to be he had wrought by devious ways but he had reached the place and what would ever have been straighter in any man s life than his way now of occupying it it hadn t merely his plan all the sanctions of civilization it was positively civilization condensed concrete consummate set down by his hands as a house on a rock a house from whose open doors and windows open to grateful to thirsty millions the higher the highest knowledge would shine out to bless the land in this house designed as a gift primarily to the people of his adoptive city and native state the urgency of whose release from the bondage of ugliness he was in a position to measure in this museum of museums a palace of art which was to show for compact as a greek temple was compact a receptacle of treasures sifted to positive sanctity his spirit to day almost altogether lived making up as he would have said for lost time and haunting the portico in anticipation of the final rites these would be the opening exercises the august dedication of the place his imagination he was well aware got over the ground faster than his judgment there was much still to do for the production of his first effect foundations were laid and walls were rising the structure of the shell all determined but raw haste was forbidden him in a connection so intimate with the highest effects of patience and piety he should belie himself by completing without a touch at least of the majesty of delay a monument to the religion he wished to propagate the exemplary passion the passion for perfection at any price he was far from knowing as yet where he would end but he was admirably definite as to where he wouldn t begin he wouldn t begin with a small show he would begin with a great and he could scarce have indicated even had he wished to try the line of division he had drawn he had taken no trouble to indicate it to his fellow citizens purveyors and consumers in his own and the circumjacent commonwealths of comic matter in large lettering diurnally set up printed published folded and delivered at the expense of his presumptuous emulation of the snail the snail had become for him under this ironic suggestion the loveliest beast in nature and his return to england of which we are present witnesses had not been unconnected with the appreciation so determined it marked what he liked to mark that he needed on the matter in question instruction from no one on earth a couple of years of europe again of renewed nearness to changes and chances refreshed sensibility to the currents of the market would fall in with the consistency of wisdom the particular shade of enlightened conviction that he wished to observe it didn t look like much for a whole family to hang about waiting they being now since the birth of his grandson a whole family and there was henceforth only one ground in all the world he felt on which the question of appearance would ever really again count for him he cared that a work of art of price should look like the master to whom it might perhaps be deceitfully attributed but he had ceased on the whole to know any matter of the rest of life by its looks he took life in general higher up the stream so far as he was not actually taking it as a collector he was taking it decidedly as a grandfather in the way of precious small pieces he had handled nothing so precious as the principino his daughter s first born whose italian designation endlessly amused him and whom he could manipulate and dandle already almost toss and catch again as he couldn t a correspondingly rare morsel of an earlier pate tendre he could take the small clutching child from his nurse s arms with an iteration grimly discountenanced in respect to their contents by the glass doors of high cabinets something clearly beatific in this new relation had moreover without doubt confirmed for him the sense that none of his silent answers to public detraction to local vulgarity had ever been so legitimately straight as the mere element of attitude reduce it he said to that in his easy weeks at fawns the element of attitude was all he wanted of these weeks and he was enjoying it on the spot even more than he had hoped enjoying it in spite of mrs rance and the miss lutches in spite of the small worry of his belief that fanny assingham had really something for him that she was keeping back in spite of his full consciousness overflowing the cup like a wine too generously poured that if he had consented to marry his daughter and thereby to make as it were the difference what surrounded him now was exactly consent vivified marriage demonstrated the difference in fine definitely made he could call back his prior his own wedded consciousness it was not yet out of range of vague reflection he had supposed himself above all he had supposed his wife as married as anyone could be and yet he wondered if their state had deserved the name or their union worn the beauty in the degree to which the couple now before him carried the matter in especial since the birth of their boy in new york the grand climax of their recent american period brought to so right an issue the happy pair struck him as having carried it higher deeper further to where it ceased to concern his imagination at any rate to follow them extraordinary beyond question was one branch of his characteristic mute wonderment it characterised above all with its subject before it his modesty the strange dim doubt waking up for him at the end of the years of whether maggie s mother had after all been capable of the maximum the maximum of tenderness he meant as the terms existed for him the maximum of immersion in the fact of being married maggie herself was capable maggie herself at this season was exquisitely divinely the maximum such was the impression that positively holding off a little for the practical the tactful consideration it inspired in him a respect for the beauty and sanctity of it almost amounting to awe such was the impression he daily received from her she was her mother oh yes but her mother and something more it becoming thus a new light for him and in such a curious way too that anything more than her mother should prove at this time of day possible he could live over again at almost any quiet moment the long process of his introduction to his present interests an introduction that had depended all on himself like the cheek of the young man who approaches a boss without credentials or picks up an acquaintance makes even a real friend by speaking to a passer in the street his real friend in all the business was to have been his own mind with which nobody had put him in relation he had knocked at the door of that essentially private house and his call in truth had not been immediately answered so that when after waiting and coming back he had at last got in it was twirling his hat as an embarrassed stranger or trying his keys as a thief at night he had gained confidence only with time but when he had taken real possession of the place it had been never again to come away all of which success represented it must be allowed his one principle of pride pride in the mere original spring pride in his money would have been pride in something that had come in comparison so easily the right ground for elation was difficulty mastered and his difficulty thanks to his modesty had been to believe in his facility this was the problem he had worked out to its solution the solution that was now doing more than all else to make his feet settle and his days flush and when he wished to feel good as they said at american city he had but to retrace his immense development that was what the whole thing came back to that the development had not been somebody s else passing falsely accepted too ignobly for his to think how servile he might have been was absolutely to respect himself was in fact as much as he liked to admire himself as free the very finest spring that ever responded to his touch was always there to press the memory of his freedom as dawning upon him like a sunrise all pink and silver during a winter divided between florence rome and naples some three years after his wife s death it was the hushed daybreak of the roman revelation in particular that he could usually best recover with the way that there above all where the princes and popes had been before him his divination of his faculty most went to his head he was a plain american citizen staying at an hotel where sometimes for days together there were twenty others like him but no pope no prince of them all had read a richer meaning he believed into the character of the patron of art he was ashamed of them really if he wasn t afraid and he had on the whole never so climbed to the tip top as in judging over a perusal of hermann grimm where julius ii and leo x were placed by their treatment of michael angelo far below the plain american citizen in the case at least in which this personage happened not to be too plain to be adam verver going to our friend s head moreover some of the results of such comparisons may doubtless be described as having stayed there his freedom to see of which the comparisons were part what could it do but steadily grow and grow it came perhaps even too much to stand to him for all freedom since for example it was as much there as ever at the very time of mrs rance s conspiring against him at fawns with the billiard room and the sunday morning on the occasion round which we have perhaps drawn our circle too wide mrs rance at least controlled practically each other license of the present and the near future the license to pass the hour as he would have found convenient the license to stop remembering for a little that though if proposed to and not only by this aspirant but by any other he wouldn t prove foolish the proof of wisdom was none the less in such a fashion rather cruelly conditioned the license in especial to proceed from his letters to his journals and insulate orientate himself afresh by the sound over his gained interval of the many mouthed monster the exercise of whose lungs he so constantly stimulated mrs rance remained with him till the others came back from church and it was by that time clearer than ever that his ordeal when it should arrive would be really most unpleasant his impression this was the point took somehow the form not so much of her wanting to press home her own advantage as of her building better than she knew that is of her symbolising with virtual unconsciousness his own special deficiency his unfortunate lack of a wife to whom applications could be referred the applications the contingencies with which mrs rance struck him as potentially bristling were not of a sort really to be met by one s self and the possibility of them when his visitor said or as good as said i m restrained you see because of mr rance and also because i m proud and refined but if it wasn t for mr rance and for my refinement and my pride the possibility of them i say turned to a great murmurous rustle of a volume to fill the future a rustle of petticoats of scented many paged letters of voices as to which distinguish themselves as they might from each other it mattered little in what part of the resounding country they had learned to make themselves prevail the assinghams and the miss lutches had taken the walk through the park to the little old church on the property that our friend had often found himself wishing he were able to transport as it stood for its simple sweetness in a glass case to one of his exhibitory halls while maggie had induced her husband not inveterate in such practices to make with her by carriage the somewhat longer pilgrimage to the nearest altar modest though it happened to be of the faith her own as it had been her mother s and as mr verver himself had been loosely willing always to let it be taken for his without the solid ease of which making the stage firm and smooth the drama of her marriage might not have been acted out what at last appeared to have happened however was that the divided parties coming back at the same moment had met outside and then drifted together from empty room to room yet not in mere aimless quest of the pair of companions they had left at home the quest had carried them to the door of the billiard room and their appearance as it opened to admit them determined for adam verver in the oddest way in the world a new and sharp perception it was really remarkable this perception expanded on the spot as a flower one of the strangest might at a breath have suddenly opened the breath for that matter was more than anything else the look in his daughter s eyes the look with which he saw her take in exactly what had occurred in her absence mrs rance s pursuit of him to this remote locality the spirit and the very form perfectly characteristic of his acceptance of the complication the seal set in short unmistakably on one of maggie s anxieties the anxiety it was true would have been even though not imparted separately shared for fanny assingham s face was by the same stroke not at all thickly veiled for him and a queer light of a colour quite to match fairly glittered in the four fine eyes of the miss lutches each of these persons counting out that is the prince and the colonel who didn t care and who didn t even see that the others did knew something or had at any rate had her idea the idea precisely that this was what mrs rance artfully biding her time would do the special shade of apprehension on the part of the miss lutches might indeed have suggested the vision of an energy supremely asserted it was droll in truth if one came to that the position of the miss lutches they had themselves brought they had guilelessly introduced mrs rance strong in the fact of mr rance s having been literally beheld of them and it was now for them positively as if their handful of flowers since mrs rance was a handful had been but the vehicle of a dangerous snake mr verver fairly felt in the air the miss lutches imputation in the intensity of which really his own propriety might have been involved that none the less was but a flicker what made the real difference as i have hinted was his mute passage with maggie his daughter s anxiety alone had depths and it opened out for him the wider that it was altogether new when in their common past when till this moment had she shown a fear however dumbly for his individual life they had had fears together just as they had had joys but all of hers at least had been for what equally concerned them here of a sudden was a question that concerned him alone and the soundless explosion of it somehow marked a date he was on her mind he was even in a manner on her hands as a distinct thing that is from being where he had always been merely deep in her heart and in her life too deep down as it were to be disengaged contrasted or opposed in short objectively presented but time finally had done it their relation was altered he saw again the difference lighted for her this marked it to himself and it wasn t a question simply of a mrs rance the more or the less for maggie too at a stroke almost beneficently their visitor had from being an inconvenience become a sign they had made vacant by their marriage his immediate foreground his personal precinct they being the princess and the prince they had made room in it for others so others had become aware he became aware himself for that matter during the minute maggie stood there before speaking and with the sense moreover of what he saw her see he had the sense of what she saw him this last it may be added would have been his intensest perception had there not the next instant been more for him in fanny assingham her face couldn t keep it from him she had seen on top of everything in her quick way what they both were seeing ix so much mute communication was doubtless all this time marvellous and we may confess to having perhaps read into the scene prematurely a critical character that took longer to develop yet the quiet hour of reunion enjoyed that afternoon by the father and the daughter did really little else than deal with the elements definitely presented to each in the vibration produced by the return of the church goers nothing allusive nothing at all insistent passed between them either before or immediately after luncheon except indeed so far as their failure soon again to meet might be itself an accident charged with reference the hour or two after luncheon and on sundays with especial rigour for one of the domestic reasons of which it belonged to maggie quite multitudinously to take account were habitually spent by the princess with her little boy in whose apartment she either frequently found her father already established or was sooner or later joined by him his visit to his grandson at some hour or other held its place in his day against all interventions and this without counting his grandson s visits to him scarcely less ordered and timed and the odd bits as he called them that they picked up together when they could communions snatched for the most part on the terrace in the gardens or the park while the principino with much pomp and circumstance of perambulator parasol fine lace over veiling and incorruptible female attendance took the air in the private apartments which occupying in the great house the larger part of a wing of their own were not much more easily accessible than if the place had been a royal palace and the small child an heir apparent in the nursery of nurseries the talk at these instituted times was always so prevailingly with or about the master of the scene that other interests and other topics had fairly learned to avoid the slighting and inadequate notice there taken of them they came in at the best but as involved in the little boy s future his past or his comprehensive present never getting so much as a chance to plead their own merits or to complain of being neglected nothing perhaps in truth had done more than this united participation to confirm in the elder parties that sense of a life not only uninterrupted but more deeply associated more largely combined of which on adam verver s behalf we have made some mention it was of course an old story and a familiar idea that a beautiful baby could take its place as a new link between a wife and a husband but maggie and her father had with every ingenuity converted the precious creature into a link between a mamma and a grandpapa the principino for a chance spectator of this process might have become by an untoward stroke a hapless half orphan with the place of immediate male parent swept bare and open to the next nearest sympathy they had no occasion thus the conjoined worshippers to talk of what the prince might be or might do for his son the sum of service in his absence so completely filled itself out it was not in the least moreover that there was doubt of him for he was conspicuously addicted to the manipulation of the child in the frank italian way at such moments as he judged discreet in respect to other claims conspicuously indeed that is for maggie who had more occasion on the whole to speak to her husband of the extravagance of her father than to speak to her father of the extravagance of her husband adam verver had all round in this connection his own serenity he was sure of his son in law s auxiliary admiration admiration he meant of his grand son since to begin with what else had been at work but the instinct or it might fairly have been the tradition of the latter s making the child so solidly beautiful as to have to be admired what contributed most to harmony in this play of relations however was the way the young man seemed to leave it to be gathered that tradition for tradition the grandpapa s own was not in any estimate to go for nothing a tradition or whatever it was that had flowered prelusively in the princess herself well amerigo s very discretions were his way of taking account of it his discriminations in respect to his heir were in fine not more angular than any others to be observed in him and mr verver received perhaps from no source so distinct an impression of being for him an odd and important phenomenon as he received from this impunity of appropriation these unchallenged nursery hours it was as if the grandpapa s special show of the character were but another side for the observer to study another item for him to note it came back this latter personage knew to his own previous perception that of the prince s inability in any matter in which he was concerned to conclude the idiosyncrasy for him at each stage had to be demonstrated on which however he admirably accepted it this last was after all the point he really worked poor young man for acceptance since he worked so constantly for comprehension and how when you came to that could you know that a horse wouldn t shy at a brass band in a country road because it didn t shy at a traction engine it might have been brought up to traction engines without having been brought up to brass bands little by little thus from month to month the prince was learning what his wife s father had been brought up to and now it could be checked off he had been brought up to the romantic view of principini who would have thought it and where would it all stop the only fear somewhat sharp for mr verver was a certain fear of disappointing him for strangeness he felt that the evidence he offered thus viewed was too much on the positive side he didn t know he was learning and it was funny for him to how many things he had been brought up if the prince could only strike something to which he hadn t this wouldn t it seemed to him ruffle the smoothness and yet might a little add to the interest what was now clear at all events for the father and the daughter was their simply knowing they wanted for the time to be together at any cost as it were and their necessity so worked in them as to bear them out of the house in a quarter hidden from that in which their friends were gathered and cause them to wander unseen unfollowed along a covered walk in the old garden as it was called old with an antiquity of formal things high box and shaped yew and expanses of brick wall that had turned at once to purple and to pink they went out of a door in the wall a door that had a slab with a date set above it but in the old multiplied lettering and then had before them a small white gate intensely white and clean amid all the greenness through which they gradually passed to where some of the grandest trees spaciously clustered and where they would find one of the quietest places a bench had been placed long ago beneath a great oak that helped to crown a mild eminence and the ground sank away below it to rise again opposite at a distance sufficient to enclose the solitude and figure a bosky horizon summer blissfully was with them yet and the low sun made a splash of light where it pierced the looser shade maggie coming down to go out had brought a parasol which as over her charming bare head she now handled it gave with the big straw hat that her father in these days always wore a good deal tipped back definite intention to their walk they knew the bench it was sequestered they had praised it for that together before and liked the word and after they had begun to linger there they could have smiled if they hadn t been really too serious and if the question hadn t so soon ceased to matter over the probable wonder of the others as to what would have become of them the extent to which they enjoyed their indifference to any judgment of their want of ceremony what did that of itself speak but for the way that as a rule they almost equally had others on their mind they each knew that both were full of the superstition of not hurting but might precisely have been asking themselves asking in fact each other at this moment whether that was to be after all the last word of their conscientious development certain it was at all events that in addition to the assinghams and the lutches and mrs rance the attendance at tea just in the right place on the west terrace might perfectly comprise the four or five persons among them the very pretty the typically irish miss maddock vaunted announced and now brought from the couple of other houses near enough one of these the minor residence of their proprietor established thriftily while he hired out his ancestral home within sight and sense of his profit it was not less certain either that for once in a way the group in question must all take the case as they found it fanny assingham at any time for that matter might perfectly be trusted to see mr verver and his daughter to see their reputation for a decent friendliness through any momentary danger might be trusted even to carry off their absence for amerigo for amerigo s possible funny italian anxiety amerigo always being as the princess was well aware conveniently amenable to this friend s explanations beguilements reassurances and perhaps in fact rather more than less dependent on them as his new life since that was his own name for it opened out it was no secret to maggie it was indeed positively a public joke for her that she couldn t explain as mrs assingham did and that the prince liking explanations liking them almost as if he collected them in the manner of book plates or postage stamps for themselves his requisition of this luxury had to be met he didn t seem to want them as yet for use rather for ornament and amusement innocent amusement of the kind he most fancied and that was so characteristic of his blessed beautiful general slightly indolent lack of more dissipated or even just of more sophisticated tastes however that might be the dear woman had come to be frankly and gaily recognised and not least by herself as filling in the intimate little circle an office that was not always a sinecure it was almost as if she had taken with her kind melancholy colonel at her heels a responsible engagement to be within call as it were for all those appeals that sprang out of talk that sprang not a little doubtless too out of leisure it naturally led her position in the household as she called it to considerable frequency of presence to visits from the good couple freely repeated and prolonged and not so much as under form of protest she was there to keep him quiet it was amerigo s own description of her influence and it would only have needed a more visible disposition to unrest in him to make the account perfectly fit fanny herself limited indeed she minimised her office you didn t need a jailor she contended for a domesticated lamb tied up with pink ribbon this was not an animal to be controlled it was an animal to be at the most educated she admitted accordingly that she was educative which maggie was so aware that she herself inevitably wasn t so it came round to being true that what she was most in charge of was his mere intelligence this left goodness knew plenty of different calls for maggie to meet in a case in which so much pink ribbon as it might be symbolically named was lavished on the creature what it all amounted to at any rate was that mrs assingham would be keeping him quiet now while his wife and his father in law carried out their own little frugal picnic quite moreover doubtless not much less neededly in respect to the members of the circle that were with them there than in respect to the pair they were missing almost for the first time it was present to maggie that the prince could bear when he was with his wife almost any queerness on the part of people strange english types who bored him beyond convenience by being so little as he himself was for this was one of the ways in which a wife was practically sustaining but she was as positively aware that she hadn t yet learned to see him as meeting such exposure in her absence how did he move and talk how above all did he or how would he look he who with his so nobly handsome face could look such wonderful things in case of being left alone with some of the subjects of his wonder there were subjects for wonder among these very neighbours only maggie herself had her own odd way which didn t moreover the least irritate him of really liking them in proportion as they could strike her as strange it came out in her by heredity he amused himself with declaring this love of chinoiseries but she actually this evening didn t mind he might deal with her chinese as he could maggie indeed would always have had for such moments had they oftener occurred the impression made on her by a word of mrs assingham s a word referring precisely to that appetite in amerigo for the explanatory which we have just found in our path it wasn t that the princess could be indebted to another person even to so clever a one as this friend for seeing anything in her husband that she mightn t see unaided but she had ever hitherto been of a nature to accept with modest gratitude any better description of a felt truth than her little limits terribly marked she knew in the direction of saying the right things enabled her to make thus it was at any rate that she was able to live more or less in the light of the fact expressed so lucidly by their common comforter the fact that the prince was saving up for some very mysterious but very fine eventual purpose all the wisdom all the answers to his questions all the impressions and generalisations he gathered putting them away and packing them down because he wanted his great gun to be loaded to the brim on the day he should decide to let it off he wanted first to make sure of the whole of the subject that was unrolling itself before him after which the innumerable facts he had collected would find their use he knew what he was about trust him at last therefore to make and to some effect his big noise and mrs assingham had repeated that he knew what he was about it was the happy form of this assurance that had remained with maggie it could always come in for her that amerigo knew what he was about he might at moments seem vague seem absent seem even bored this when away from her father with whom it was impossible for him to appear anything but respectfully occupied he let his native gaiety go in outbreaks of song or even of quite whimsical senseless sound either expressive of intimate relaxation or else fantastically plaintive he might at times reflect with the frankest lucidity on the circumstance that the case was for a good while yet absolutely settled in regard to what he still had left at home of his very own in regard to the main seat of his affection the house in rome the big black palace the palazzo nero as he was fond of naming it and also on the question of the villa in the sabine hills which she had at the time of their engagement seen and yearned over and the castello proper described by him always as the perched place that had as she knew formerly stood up on the pedestal of its mountain slope showing beautifully blue from afar as the head and front of the princedom he might rejoice in certain moods over the so long estranged state of these properties not indeed all irreclaimably alienated but encumbered with unending leases and charges with obstinate occupants with impossibilities of use all without counting the cloud of mortgages that had from far back buried them beneath the ashes of rage and remorse a shroud as thick as the layer once resting on the towns at the foot of vesuvius and actually making of any present restorative effort a process much akin to slow excavation just so he might with another turn of his humour almost wail for these brightest spots of his lost paradise declaring that he was an idiot not to be able to bring himself to face the sacrifices sacrifices resting if definitely anywhere with mr verver necessary for winning them back one of the most comfortable things between the husband and the wife meanwhile one of those easy certitudes they could be merely gay about was that she never admired him so much or so found him heartbreakingly handsome clever irresistible in the very degree in which he had originally and fatally dawned upon her as when she saw other women reduced to the same passive pulp that had then begun once for all to constitute her substance there was really nothing they had talked of together with more intimate and familiar pleasantry than of the license and privilege the boundless happy margin thus established for each she going so far as to put it that even should he some day get drunk and beat her the spectacle of him with hated rivals would after no matter what extremity always for the sovereign charm of it charm of it in itself and as the exhibition of him that most deeply moved her suffice to bring her round what would therefore be more open to him than to keep her in love with him he agreed with all his heart at these light moments that his course wouldn t then be difficult inasmuch as so simply constituted as he was on all the precious question and why should he be ashamed of it he knew but one way with the fair they had to be fair and he was fastidious and particular his standard was high but when once this was the case what relation with them was conceivable what relation was decent rudimentary properly human but that of a plain interest in the fairness his interest she always answered happened not to be plain and plainness all round had little to do with the matter which was marked on the contrary by the richest variety of colour but the working basis at all events had been settled the miss maddocks of life been assured of their importance for him how conveniently assured maggie to take him too into the joke had more than once gone so far as to mention to her father since it fell in easily with the tenderness of her disposition to remember she might occasionally make him happy by an intimate confidence this was one of her rules full as she was of little rules considerations provisions there were things she of course couldn t tell him in so many words about amerigo and herself and about their happiness and their union and their deepest depths and there were other things she needn t but there were also those that were both true and amusing both communicable and real and of these with her so conscious so delicately cultivated scheme of conduct as a daughter she could make her profit at will a pleasant hush for that matter had fallen on most of the elements while she lingered apart with her companion it involved this serenity innumerable complete assumptions since so ordered and so splendid a rest all the tokens spreading about them of confidence solidly supported might have suggested for persons of poorer pitch the very insolence of facility still they weren t insolent they weren t our pair could reflect they were only blissful and grateful and personally modest not ashamed of knowing with competence when great things were great when good things were good and when safe things were safe and not therefore placed below their fortune by timidity which would have been as bad as being below it by impudence worthy of it as they were and as each appears under our last possible analysis to have wished to make the other feel that they were what they most finally exhaled into the evening air as their eyes mildly met may well have been a kind of helplessness in their felicity their rightness the justification of everything something they so felt the pulse of sat there with them but they might have been asking themselves a little blankly to what further use they could put anything so perfect they had created and nursed and established it they had housed it here in dignity and crowned it with comfort but mightn t the moment possibly count for them or count at least for us while we watch them with their fate all before them as the dawn of the discovery that it doesn t always meet all contingencies to be right otherwise why should maggie have found a word of definite doubt the expression of the fine pang determined in her a few hours before rise after a time to her lips she took so for granted moreover her companion s intelligence of her doubt that the mere vagueness of her question could say it all what is it after all that they want to do to you they were for the princess too the hovering forces of which mrs rance was the symbol and her father only smiling back now at his ease took no trouble to appear not to know what she meant what she meant when once she had spoken could come out well enough though indeed it was nothing after they had come to the point that could serve as ground for a great defensive campaign the waters of talk spread a little and maggie presently contributed an idea in saying what has really happened is that the proportions for us are altered he accepted equally for the time this somewhat cryptic remark he still failed to challenge her even when she added that it wouldn t so much matter if he hadn t been so terribly young he uttered a sound of protest only when she went to declare that she ought as a daughter in common decency to have waited yet by that time she was already herself admitting that she should have had to wait long if she waited that is till he was old but there was a way since you are an irresistible youth we ve got to face it that somehow is what that woman has made me feel there ll be others x to talk of it thus appeared at last a positive relief to him yes there ll be others but you ll see me through she hesitated do you mean if you give in oh no through my holding out maggie waited again but when she spoke it had an effect of abruptness why should you hold out forever he gave none the less no start and this as from the habit of taking anything taking everything from her as harmonious but it was quite written upon him too for that matter that holding out wouldn t be so very completely his natural or at any rate his acquired form his appearance would have testified that he might have to do so a long time for a man so greatly beset this appearance that is spoke but little as yet of short remainders and simplified senses and all in spite of his being a small spare slightly stale person deprived of the general prerogative of presence it was not by mass or weight or vulgar immediate quantity that he would in the future any more than he had done in the past insist or resist or prevail there was even something in him that made his position on any occasion made his relation to any scene or to any group a matter of the back of the stage of an almost visibly conscious want of affinity with the footlights he would have figured less than anything the stage manager or the author of the play who most occupy the foreground he might be at the best the financial backer watching his interests from the wing but in rather confessed ignorance of the mysteries of mimicry barely taller than his daughter he pressed at no point on the presumed propriety of his greater stoutness he had lost early in life much of his crisp closely curling hair the fineness of which was repeated in a small neat beard too compact to be called full though worn equally as for a mark where other marks were wanting on lip and cheek and chin his neat colourless face provided with the merely indispensable features suggested immediately for a description that it was clear and in this manner somewhat resembled a small decent room clean swept and unencumbered with furniture but drawing a particular advantage as might presently be noted from the outlook of a pair of ample and uncurtained windows there was something in adam verver s eyes that both admitted the morning and the evening in unusual quantities and gave the modest area the outward extension of a view that was big even when restricted to stars deeply and changeably blue though not romantically large they were yet youthfully almost strangely beautiful with their ambiguity of your scarce knowing if they most carried their possessor s vision out or most opened themselves to your own whatever you might feel they stamped the place with their importance as the house agents say so that on one side or the other you were never out of their range were moving about for possible community opportunity the sight of you scarce knew what either before them or behind them if other importances not to extend the question kept themselves down they were in no direction less obtruded than in that of our friend s dress adopted once for all as with a sort of sumptuary scruple he wore every day of the year whatever the occasion the same little black cut away coat of the fashion of his younger time he wore the same cool looking trousers chequered in black and white the proper harmony with which he inveterately considered was a sprigged blue satin necktie and over his concave little stomach quaintly indifferent to climates and seasons a white duck waistcoat should you really he now asked like me to marry he spoke as if coming from his daughter herself it might be an idea which for that matter he would be ready to carry out should she definitely say so definite however just yet she was not prepared to be though it seemed to come to her with force as she thought that there was a truth in the connection to utter what i feel is that there is somehow something that used to be right and that i ve made wrong it used to be right that you hadn t married and that you didn t seem to want to it used also she continued to make out to seem easy for the question not to come up that s what i ve made different it does come up it will come up you don t think i can keep it down mr verver s tone was cheerfully pensive well i ve given you by my move all the trouble of having to he liked the tenderness of her idea and it made him as she sat near him pass his arm about her i guess i don t feel as if you had moved very far you ve only moved next door well she continued i don t feel as if it were fair for me just to have given you a push and left you so if i ve made the difference for you i must think of the difference then what darling he indulgently asked do you think that s just what i don t yet know but i must find out we must think together as we ve always thought what i mean she went on after a moment is that it strikes me that i ought to at least offer you some alternative i ought to have worked one out for you an alternative to what well to your simply missing what you ve lost without anything being done about it but what have i lost she thought a minute as if it were difficult to say yet as if she more and more saw it well whatever it was that before kept us from thinking and kept you really as you might say in the market it was as if you couldn t be in the market when you were married to me or rather as if i kept people off innocently by being married to you now that i m married to some one else you re as in consequence married to nobody therefore you may be married to anybody to everybody people don t see why you shouldn t be married to them isn t it enough of a reason he mildly inquired that i don t want to be it s enough of a reason yes but to be enough of a reason it has to be too much of a trouble i mean for you it has to be too much of a fight you ask me what you ve lost maggie continued to explain the not having to take the trouble and to make the fight that s what you ve lost the advantage the happiness of being just as you were because i was just as i was that s what you miss so that you think her father presently said that i had better get married just in order to be as i was before the detached tone of it detached as if innocently to amuse her by showing his desire to accommodate was so far successful as to draw from her gravity a short light laugh well what i don t want you to feel is that if you were to i shouldn t understand i should understand that s all said the princess gently her companion turned it pleasantly over you don t go so far as to wish me to take somebody i don t like ah father she sighed you know how far i go how far i could go but i only wish that if you ever should like anybody you may never doubt of my feeling how i ve brought you to it you ll always know that i know that it s my fault you mean he went on in his contemplative way that it will be you who ll take the consequences maggie just considered i ll leave you all the good ones but i ll take the bad well that s handsome he emphasised his sense of it by drawing her closer and holding her more tenderly it s about all i could expect of you so far as you ve wronged me therefore we ll call it square i ll let you know in time if i see a prospect of your having to take it up but am i to understand meanwhile he soon went on that ready as you are to see me through my collapse you re not ready or not as ready to see me through my resistance i ve got to be a regular martyr before you ll be inspired she demurred at his way of putting it why if you like it you know it won t be a collapse then why talk about seeing me through at all i shall only collapse if i do like it but what i seem to feel is that i don t want to like it that is he amended unless i feel surer i do than appears very probable i don t want to have to think i like it in a case when i really shan t i ve had to do that in some cases he confessed when it has been a question of other things i don t want he wound up to be made to make a mistake ah but it s too dreadful she returned that you should even have to fear or just nervously to dream that you may be what does that show after all she asked but that you do really well within feel a want what does it show but that you re truly susceptible well it may show that he defended himself against nothing but it shows also i think that charming women are in the kind of life we re leading now numerous and formidable maggie entertained for a moment the proposition under cover of which however she passed quickly from the general to the particular do you feel mrs rance to be charming well i feel her to be formidable when they cast a spell it comes to the same thing i think she d do anything oh well i d help you the princess said with decision as against her if that s all you require it s too funny she went on before he again spoke that mrs rance should be here at all but if you talk of the life we lead much of it is altogether i m bound to say too funny the thing is maggie developed under this impression that i don t think we lead as regards other people any life at all we don t at any rate it seems to me lead half the life we might and so it seems i think to amerigo so it seems also i m sure to fanny assingham mr verver as if from due regard for these persons considered a little what life would they like us to lead oh it s not a question i think on which they quite feel together she thinks dear fanny that we ought to be greater greater he echoed it vaguely and amerigo too you say ah yes her reply was prompt but amerigo doesn t mind he doesn t care i mean what we do it s for us he considers to see things exactly as we wish fanny herself maggie pursued thinks he s magnificent magnificent i mean for taking everything as it is for accepting the social limitations of our life for not missing what we don t give him mr verver attended then if he doesn t miss it his magnificence is easy it is easy that s exactly what i think if there were things he did miss and if in spite of them he were always sweet then no doubt he would be a more or less unappreciated hero he could be a hero he will be one if it s ever necessary but it will be about something better than our dreariness i know the princess declared where he s magnificent and she rested a minute on that she ended however as she had begun we re not all the same committed to anything stupid if we ought to be grander as fanny thinks we can be grander there s nothing to prevent is it a strict moral obligation adam verver inquired no it s for the amusement for whose for fanny s own for everyone s though i dare say fanny s would be a large part she hesitated she had now it might have appeared something more to bring out which she finally produced for yours in particular say if you go into the question she even bravely followed it up i haven t really after all had to think much to see that much more can be done for you than is done mr verver uttered an odd vague sound don t you think a good deal is done when you come out and talk to me this way ah said his daughter smiling at him we make too much of that and then to explain that s good and it s natural but it isn t great we forget that we re as free as air well that s great mr verver pleaded great if we act on it not if we don t she continued to smile and he took her smile wondering again a little by this time however struck more and more by an intensity in it that belied a light tone what do you want he demanded to do to me and he added as she didn t say you ve got something in your mind it had come to him within the minute that from the beginning of their session there she had been keeping something back and that an impression of this had more than once in spite of his general theoretic respect for her present right to personal reserves and mysteries almost ceased to be vague in him there had been from the first something in her anxious eyes in the way she occasionally lost herself that it would perfectly explain he was therefore now quite sure you ve got something up your sleeve she had a silence that made him right well when i tell you you ll understand it s only up my sleeve in the sense of being in a letter i got this morning all day yes it has been in my mind i ve been asking myself if it were quite the right moment or in any way fair to ask you if you could stand just now another woman it relieved him a little yet the beautiful consideration of her manner made it in a degree portentous stand one well mind her coming he stared then he laughed it depends on who she is there you see i ve at all events been thinking whether you d take this particular person but as a worry the more whether that is you d go so far with her in your notion of having to be kind he gave at this the quickest shake to his foot how far would she go in her notion of it well his daughter returned you know how far in a general way charlotte stant goes charlotte is she coming she writes me practically that she d like to if we re so good as to ask her mr verver continued to gaze but rather as if waiting for more then as everything appeared to have come his expression had a drop if this was all it was simple then why in the world not maggie s face lighted anew but it was now another light it isn t a want of tact to ask her to propose it to you that i should ask her he put the question as an effect of his remnant of vagueness but this had also its own effect maggie wondered an instant after which as with a flush of recognition she took it up it would be too beautiful if you would this clearly had not been her first idea the chance of his words had prompted it do you mean write to her myself yes it would be kind it would be quite beautiful of you that is of course said maggie if you sincerely can he appeared to wonder an instant why he sincerely shouldn t and indeed for that matter where the question of sincerity came in this virtue between him and his daughter s friend had surely been taken for granted my dear child he returned i don t think i m afraid of charlotte well that s just what it s lovely to have from you from the moment you re not the least little bit i ll immediately invite her but where in the world is she he spoke as if he had not thought of charlotte nor so much as heard her name pronounced for a very long time he quite in fact amicably almost amusedly woke up to her she s in brittany at a little bathing place with some people i don t know she s always with people poor dear she rather has to be even when as is sometimes the case they re people she doesn t immensely like well i guess she likes us said adam verver yes fortunately she likes us and if i wasn t afraid of spoiling it for you maggie added i d even mention that you re not the one of our number she likes least why should that spoil it for me oh my dear you know what else have we been talking about it costs you so much to be liked that s why i hesitated to tell you of my letter he stared a moment as if the subject had suddenly grown out of recognition but charlotte on other visits never used to cost me anything no only her keep maggie smiled then i don t think i mind her keep if that s all the princess however it was clear wished to be thoroughly conscientious well it may not be quite all if i think of its being pleasant to have her it s because she will make a difference well what s the harm in that if it s but a difference for the better ah then there you are and the princess showed in her smile her small triumphant wisdom if you acknowledge a possible difference for the better we re not after all so tremendously right as we are i mean we re not as satisfied and amused we do see there are ways of being grander but will charlotte stant her father asked with surprise make us grander maggie on this looking at him well had a remarkable reply yes i think really grander he thought for if this was a sudden opening he wished but the more to meet it because she s so handsome no father and the princess was almost solemn because she s so great great great in nature in character in spirit great in life so mr verver echoed what has she done in life well she has been brave and bright said maggie that mayn t sound like much but she has been so in the face of things that might well have made it too difficult for many other girls she hasn t a creature in the world really that is nearly belonging to her only acquaintances who in all sorts of ways make use of her and distant relations who are so afraid she ll make use of them that they seldom let her look at them mr verver was struck and as usual to some purpose if we get her here to improve us don t we too then make use of her it pulled the princess up however but an instant we re old old friends we do her good too i should always even at the worst speaking for myself admire her still more than i used her i see that always does good maggie hesitated certainly she knows it she knows i mean how great i think her courage and her cleverness she s not afraid not of anything and yet she no more ever takes a liberty with you than if she trembled for her life and then she s interesting which plenty of other people with plenty of other merits never are a bit in which fine flicker of vision the truth widened to the princess s view i myself of course don t take liberties but then i do always by nature tremble for my life that s the way i live oh i say love her father vaguely murmured yes i live in terror she insisted i m a small creeping thing you ll not persuade me that you re not as good as charlotte stant he still placidly enough remarked i may be as good but i m not so great and that s what we re talking about she has a great imagination she has in every way a great attitude she has above all a great conscience more perhaps than ever in her life before maggie addressed her father at this moment with a shade of the absolute in her tone she had never come so near telling him what he should take it from her to believe she has only twopence in the world but that has nothing to do with it or rather indeed she quickly corrected herself it has everything for she doesn t care i never saw her do anything but laugh at her poverty her life has been harder than anyone knows it was moreover as if thus unprecedentedly positive his child had an effect upon him that mr verver really felt as a new thing why then haven t you told me about her before well haven t we always known i should have thought he submitted that we had already pretty well sized her up certainly we long ago quite took her for granted but things change with time and i seem to know that after this interval i m going to like her better than ever i ve lived more myself i m older and one judges better yes i m going to see in charlotte said the princess and speaking now as with high and free expectation more than i ve ever seen then i ll try to do so too she was it came back to mr verver more the one of your friends i thought the best for you his companion however was so launched in her permitted liberty of appreciation that she for the moment scarce heard him she was lost in the case she made out the vision of the different ways in which charlotte had distinguished herself she would have liked for instance i m sure she would have liked extremely to marry and nothing in general is more ridiculous even when it has been pathetic than a woman who has tried and has not been able it had all mr verver s attention she has tried she has seen cases where she would have liked to but she has not been able well there are more cases in europe in which it doesn t come to girls who are poor than in which it does come to them especially said maggie with her continued competence when they re americans well her father now met her and met her cheerfully on all sides unless you mean he suggested that when the girls are american there are more cases in which it comes to the rich than to the poor she looked at him good humouredly that may be but i m not going to be smothered in my case it ought to make me if i were in danger of being a fool all the nicer to people like charlotte it s not hard for me she practically explained not to be ridiculous unless in a very different way i might easily be ridiculous i suppose by behaving as if i thought i had done a great thing charlotte at any rate has done nothing and anyone can see it and see also that it s rather strange and yet no one no one not awfully presumptuous or offensive would like or would dare to treat her just as she is as anything but quite right that s what it is to have something about you that carries things off mr verver s silence on this could only be a sign that she had caused her story to interest him though the sign when he spoke was perhaps even sharper and is it also what you mean by charlotte s being great well said maggie it s one of her ways but she has many again for a little her father considered and who is it she has tried to marry maggie on her side as well waited as if to bring it out with effect but she after a minute either renounced or encountered an obstacle i m afraid i m not sure then how do you know well i don t know and qualifying again she was earnestly emphatic i only make it out for myself but you must make it out about someone in particular she had another pause i don t think i want even for myself to put names and times to pull away any veil i ve an idea there has been more than once somebody i m not acquainted with and needn t be or want to be in any case it s all over and beyond giving her credit for everything it s none of my business mr verver deferred yet he discriminated i don t see how you can give credit without knowing the facts can t i give it generally for dignity dignity i mean in misfortune you ve got to postulate the misfortune first well said maggie i can do that isn t it always a misfortune to be when you re so fine so wasted and yet she went on not to wail about it not to look even as if you knew it mr verver seemed at first to face this as a large question and then after a little solicited by another view to let the appeal drop well she mustn t be wasted we won t at least have waste it produced in maggie s face another gratitude then dear sir that s all i want and it would apparently have settled their question and ended their talk if her father had not after a little shown the disposition to revert how many times are you supposing that she has tried once more at this and as if she hadn t been couldn t be hated to be in such delicate matters literal she was moved to attenuate oh i don t say she absolutely ever tried he looked perplexed but if she has so absolutely failed what then had she done she has suffered she has done that and the princess added she has loved and she has lost mr verver however still wondered but how many times maggie hesitated but it cleared up once is enough enough that is for one to be kind to her her father listened yet not challenging only as with a need of some basis on which under these new lights his bounty could be firm but has she told you nothing ah thank goodness no he stared then don t young women tell because you mean it s just what they re supposed to do she looked at him flushed again now with which after another hesitation do young men tell she asked he gave a short laugh how do i know my dear what young men do then how do i know father what vulgar girls do i see i see he quickly returned but she spoke the next moment as if she might odiously have been sharp what happens at least is that where there s a great deal of pride there s a great deal of silence i don t know i admit what i should do if i were lonely and sore for what sorrow to speak of have i ever had in my life i don t know even if i m proud it seems to me the question has never come up for me oh i guess you re proud mag her father cheerfully interposed i mean i guess you re proud enough well then i hope i m humble enough too i might at all events for all i know be abject under a blow how can i tell do you realise father that i ve never had the least blow he gave her a long quiet look who should realise if i don t well you ll realise when i have one she exclaimed with a short laugh that resembled as for good reasons his own of a minute before i wouldn t in any case have let her tell me what would have been dreadful to me for such wounds and shames are dreadful at least she added catching herself up i suppose they are for what as i say do i know of them i don t want to know she spoke quite with vehemence there are things that are sacred whether they re joys or pains but one can always for safety be kind she kept on one feels when that s right she had got up with these last words she stood there before him with that particular suggestion in her aspect to which even the long habit of their life together had not closed his sense kept sharp year after year by the collation of types and signs the comparison of fine object with fine object of one degree of finish of one form of the exquisite with another the appearance of some slight slim draped antique of vatican or capitoline halls late and refined rare as a note and immortal as a link set in motion by the miraculous infusion of a modern impulse and yet for all the sudden freedom of folds and footsteps forsaken after centuries by their pedestal keeping still the quality the perfect felicity of the statue the blurred absent eyes the smoothed elegant nameless head the impersonal flit of a creature lost in an alien age and passing as an image in worn relief round and round a precious vase she had always had odd moments of striking him daughter of his very own though she was as a figure thus simplified generalised in its grace a figure with which his human connection was fairly interrupted by some vague analogy of turn and attitude something shyly mythological and nymphlike the trick he was not uncomplacently aware was mainly of his own mind it came from his caring for precious vases only less than for precious daughters and what was more to the point still it often operated while he was quite at the same time conscious that maggie had been described even in her prettiness as prim mrs rance herself had enthusiastically used the word of her while he remembered that when once she had been told before him familiarly that she resembled a nun she had replied that she was delighted to hear it and would certainly try to while also finally it was present to him that discreetly heedless thanks to her long association with nobleness in art to the leaps and bounds of fashion she brought her hair down very straight and flat over her temples in the constant manner of her mother who had not been a bit mythological nymphs and nuns were certainly separate types but mr verver when he really amused himself let consistency go the play of vision was at all events so rooted in him that he could receive impressions of sense even while positively thinking he was positively thinking while maggie stood there and it led for him to yet another question which in its turn led to others still do you regard the condition as hers then that you spoke of a minute ago the condition why that of having loved so intensely that she s as you say beyond everything maggie had scarcely to reflect her answer was so prompt oh no she s beyond nothing for she has had nothing i see you must have had things to be them it s a kind of law of perspective maggie didn t know about the law but she continued definite she s not for example beyond help oh well then she shall have all we can give her i ll write to her he said with pleasure angel she answered as she gaily and tenderly looked at him true as this might be however there was one thing more he was an angel with a human curiosity has she told you she likes me much certainly she has told me but i won t pamper you let it be enough for you it has always been one of my reasons for liking her then she s indeed not beyond everything mr verver more or less humorously observed oh it isn t thank goodness that she s in love with you it s not as i told you at first the sort of thing for you to fear he had spoken with cheer but it appeared to drop before this reassurance as if the latter overdid his alarm and that should be corrected oh my dear i ve always thought of her as a little girl ah she s not a little girl said the princess then i ll write to her as a brilliant woman it s exactly what she is mr verver had got up as he spoke and for a little before retracing their steps they stood looking at each other as if they had really arranged something they had come out together for themselves but it had produced something more what it had produced was in fact expressed by the words with which he met his companion s last emphasis well she has a famous friend in you princess maggie took this in it was too plain for a protest do you know what i m really thinking of she asked he wondered with her eyes on him eyes of contentment at her freedom now to talk and he wasn t such a fool he presently showed as not suddenly to arrive at it why of your finding her at last yourself a husband good for you maggie smiled but it will take she added some looking then let me look right here with you her father said as they walked on xi mrs assingham and the colonel quitting fawns before the end of september had come back later on and now a couple of weeks after they were again interrupting their stay but this time with the question of their return left to depend on matters that were rather hinted at than importunately named the lutches and mrs rance had also by the action of charlotte stant s arrival ceased to linger though with hopes and theories as to some promptitude of renewal of which the lively expression awakening the echoes of the great stone paved oak panelled galleried hall that was not the least interesting feature of the place seemed still a property of the air it was on this admirable spot that before her october afternoon had waned fanny assingham spent with her easy host a few moments which led to her announcing her own and her husband s final secession at the same time as they tempted her to point the moral of all vain reverberations the double door of the house stood open to an effect of hazy autumn sunshine a wonderful windless waiting golden hour under the influence of which adam verver met his genial friend as she came to drop into the post box with her own hand a thick sheaf of letters they presently thereafter left the house together and drew out half an hour on the terrace in a manner they were to revert to in thought later on as that of persons who really had been taking leave of each other at a parting of the ways he traced his impression on coming to consider back to a mere three words she had begun by using about charlotte stant she simply cleared them out those had been the three words thrown off in reference to the general golden peace that the kentish october had gradually ushered in the halcyon days the full beauty of which had appeared to shine out for them after charlotte s arrival for it was during these days that mrs rance and the miss lutches had been observed to be gathering themselves for departure and it was with that difference made that the sense of the whole situation showed most fair the sense of how right they had been to engage for so ample a residence and of all the pleasure so fruity an autumn there could hold in its lap this was what had occurred that their lesson had been learned and what mrs assingham had dwelt upon was that without charlotte it would have been learned but half it would certainly not have been taught by mrs rance and the miss lutches if these ladies had remained with them as long as at one time seemed probable charlotte s light intervention had thus become a cause operating covertly but none the less actively and fanny assingham s speech which she had followed up a little echoed within him fairly to startle him as the indication of something irresistible he could see now how this superior force had worked and he fairly liked to recover the sight little harm as he dreamed of doing little ill as he dreamed of wishing the three ladies whom he had after all entertained for a stiffish series of days she had been so vague and quiet about it wonderful charlotte that he hadn t known what was happening happening that is as a result of her influence their fires as they felt her turned to smoke mrs assingham remarked which he was to reflect on indeed even while they strolled he had retained since his long talk with maggie the talk that had settled the matter of his own direct invitation to her friend an odd little taste as he would have described it for hearing things said about this young woman hearing so to speak what could be said about her almost as it her portrait by some eminent hand were going on so that he watched it grow under the multiplication of touches mrs assingham it struck him applied two or three of the finest in their discussion of their young friend so different a figure now from that early playmate of maggie s as to whom he could almost recall from of old the definite occasions of his having paternally lumped the two children together in the recommendation that they shouldn t make too much noise nor eat too much jam his companion professed that in the light of charlotte s prompt influence she had not been a stranger to a pang of pity for their recent visitors i felt in fact privately so sorry for them that i kept my impression to myself while they were here wishing not to put the rest of you on the scent neither maggie nor the prince nor yourself nor even charlotte herself if you didn t happen to notice since you didn t apparently i perhaps now strike you as extravagant but i m not i followed it all one saw the consciousness i speak of come over the poor things very much as i suppose people at the court of the borgias may have watched each other begin to look queer after having had the honour of taking wine with the heads of the family my comparison s only a little awkward for i don t in the least mean that charlotte was consciously dropping poison into their cup she was just herself their poison in the sense of mortally disagreeing with them but she didn t know it ah she didn t know it mr verver had asked with interest well i think she didn t mrs assingham had to admit that she hadn t pressingly sounded her i don t pretend to be sure in every connection of what charlotte knows she doesn t certainly like to make people suffer not in general as is the case with so many of us even other women she likes much rather to put them at their ease with her she likes that is as all pleasant people do to be liked ah she likes to be liked her companion had gone on she did at the same time no doubt want to help us to put us at our ease that is she wanted to put you and to put maggie about you so far as that went she had a plan but it was only after it was not before i really believe that she saw how effectively she could work again as mr verver felt he must have taken it up ah she wanted to help us wanted to help me why mrs assingham asked after an instant should it surprise you he just thought oh it doesn t she saw of course as soon as she came with her quickness where we all were she didn t need each of us to go by appointment to her room at night or take her out into the fields for our palpitating tale no doubt even she was rather impatient of the poor things mr verver had here inquired while he waited well of your not yourselves being so and of your not in particular i haven t the least doubt in the world par exemple that she thinks you too meek oh she thinks me too meek and she had been sent for on the very face of it to work right in all she had to do after all was to be nice to you to a me said adam verver he could remember now that his friend had positively had a laugh for his tone to you and to every one she had only to be what she is and to be it all round if she s charming how can she help it so it was and so only that she acted as the borgia wine used to act one saw it come over them the extent to which in her particular way a woman a woman other and so other than themselves could be charming one saw them understand and exchange looks then one saw them lose heart and decide to move for what they had to take home was that it s she who s the real thing ah it s she who s the real thing as he had not hitherto taken it home as completely as the miss lutches and mrs rance so doubtless he had now a little appeared to offer submission in his appeal i see i see he could at least simply take it home now yet as not without wanting at the same time to be sure of what the real thing was and what would it be a definitely that you understand by that she had only for an instant not found it easy to say why exactly what those women themselves want to be and what her effect on them is to make them recognise that they never will oh of course never it not only remained and abode with them it positively developed and deepened after this talk that the luxurious side of his personal existence was now again furnished socially speaking with the thing classed and stamped as real just as he had been able to think of it as not otherwise enriched in consequence of his daughter s marriage the note of reality in so much projected light continued to have for him the charm and the importance of which the maximum had occasionally been reached in his great finds continued beyond any other to keep him attentive and gratified nothing perhaps might affect us as queerer had we time to look into it than this application of the same measure of value to such different pieces of property as old persian carpets say and new human acquisitions all the more indeed that the amiable man was not without an inkling on his own side that he was as a taster of life economically constructed he put into his one little glass everything he raised to his lips and it was as if he had always carried in his pocket like a tool of his trade this receptacle a little glass cut with a fineness of which the art had long since been lost and kept in an old morocco case stamped in uneffaceable gilt with the arms of a deposed dynasty as it had served him to satisfy himself so to speak both about amerigo and about the bernadino luini he had happened to come to knowledge of at the time he was consenting to the announcement of his daughter s betrothal so it served him at present to satisfy himself about charlotte stant and an extraordinary set of oriental tiles of which he had lately got wind to which a provoking legend was attached and as to which he had made out contentedly that further news was to be obtained from a certain mr gutermann seuss of brighton it was all at bottom in him the aesthetic principle planted where it could burn with a cold still flame where it fed almost wholly on the material directly involved on the idea followed by appropriation of plastic beauty of the thing visibly perfect in its kind where in short in spite of the general tendency of the devouring element to spread the rest of his spiritual furniture modest scattered and tended with unconscious care escaped the consumption that in so many cases proceeds from the undue keeping up of profane altar fires adam verver had in other words learnt the lesson of the senses to the end of his own little book without having for a day raised the smallest scandal in his economy at large being in this particular not unlike those fortunate bachelors or other gentlemen of pleasure who so manage their entertainment of compromising company that even the austerest housekeeper occupied and competent below stairs never feels obliged to give warning that figure has however a freedom that the occasion doubtless scarce demands though we may retain it for its rough negative value it was to come to pass by a pressure applied to the situation wholly from within that before the first ten days of november had elapsed he found himself practically alone at fawns with his young friend amerigo and maggie having with a certain abruptness invited his assent to their going abroad for a month since his amusement was now scarce less happily assured than his security an impulse eminently natural had stirred within the prince his life as for some time established was deliciously dull and thereby on the whole what he best liked but a small gust of yearning had swept over him and maggie repeated to her father with infinite admiration the pretty terms in which after it had lasted a little he had described to her this experience he called it a serenade a low music that outside one of the windows of the sleeping house disturbed his rest at night timid as it was and plaintive he yet couldn t close his eyes for it and when finally rising on tiptoe he had looked out he had recognised in the figure below with a mandolin all duskily draped in her grace the raised appealing eyes and the one irresistible voice of the ever to be loved italy sooner or later that way one had to listen it was a hovering haunting ghost as of a creature to whom one had done a wrong a dim pathetic shade crying out to be comforted for this there was obviously but one way as there were doubtless also many words for the simple fact that so prime a roman had a fancy for again seeing rome they would accordingly hadn t they better go for a little maggie meanwhile making the too absurdly artful point with her father so that he repeated it in his amusement to charlotte stant to whom he was by this time conscious of addressing many remarks that it was absolutely when she came to think the first thing amerigo had ever asked of her she doesn t count of course his having asked of her to marry him this was mr verver s indulgent criticism but he found charlotte equally touched by the ingenuous maggie in easy agreement with him over the question if the prince had asked something of his wife every day in the year this would be still no reason why the poor dear man should not in a beautiful fit of homesickness revisit without reproach his native country what his father in law frankly counselled was that the reasonable the really too reasonable pair should while they were about it take three or four weeks of paris as well paris being always for mr verver in any stress of sympathy a suggestion that rose of itself to the lips if they would only do that on their way back or however they preferred it charlotte and he would go over to join them there for a small look though even then assuredly as he had it at heart to add not in the least because they should have found themselves bored at being left together the fate of this last proposal indeed was that it reeled for the moment under an assault of destructive analysis from maggie who having as she granted to choose between being an unnatural daughter or an unnatural mother and electing for the former wanted to know what would become of the principino if the house were cleared of everyone but the servants her question had fairly resounded but it had afterwards like many of her questions dropped still more effectively than it had risen the highest moral of the matter being before the couple took their departure that mrs noble and dr brady must mount unchallenged guard over the august little crib if she hadn t supremely believed in the majestic value of the nurse whose experience was in itself the amplest of pillows just as her attention was a spreading canopy from which precedent and reminiscence dropped as thickly as parted curtains if she hadn t been able to rest in this confidence she would fairly have sent her husband on his journey without her in the same manner if the sweetest for it was so she qualified him of little country doctors hadn t proved to her his wisdom by rendering irresistible especially on rainy days and in direct proportion to the frequency of his calls adapted to all weathers that she should converse with him for hours over causes and consequences over what he had found to answer with his little five at home she would have drawn scant support from the presence of a mere grandfather and a mere brilliant friend these persons accordingly her own predominance having thus for the time given way could carry with a certain ease and above all with mutual aid their consciousness of a charge so far as their office weighed they could help each other with it which was in fact to become as mrs noble herself loomed larger for them not a little of a relief and a diversion mr verver met his young friend at certain hours in the day nursery very much as he had regularly met the child s fond mother charlotte having as she clearly considered given maggie equal pledges and desiring never to fail of the last word for the daily letter she had promised to write she wrote with high fidelity she let her companion know and the effect of it was remarkably enough that he himself didn t write the reason of this was partly that charlotte told all about him which she also let him know she did and partly that he enjoyed feeling as a consequence that he was generally quite systematically eased and as they said done for committed as it were to this charming and clever young woman who by becoming for him a domestic resource had become for him practically a new person and committed especially in his own house which somehow made his sense of it a deeper thing he took an interest in seeing how far the connection could carry him could perhaps even lead him and in thus putting to the test for pleasant verification what fanny assingham had said at the last about the difference such a girl could make she was really making one now in their simplified existence and a very considerable one though there was no one to compare her with as there had been so usefully for fanny no mrs rance no kitty no dotty lutch to help her to be felt according to fanny s diagnosis as real she was real decidedly from other causes and mr verver grew in time even a little amused at the amount of machinery mrs assingham had seemed to see needed for pointing it she was directly and immediately real real on a pleasantly reduced and intimate scale and at no moments more so than during those at which we have just glanced when mrs noble made them both together feel that she she alone in the absence of the queen mother was regent of the realm and governess of the heir treated on such occasions as at best a pair of dangling and merely nominal court functionaries picturesque hereditary triflers entitled to the petites entrees but quite external to the state which began and ended with the nursery they could only retire in quickened sociability to what was left them of the palace there to digest their gilded insignificance and cultivate in regard to the true executive such snuff taking ironies as might belong to rococo chamberlains moving among china lap dogs every evening after dinner charlotte stant played to him seated at the piano and requiring no music she went through his favourite things and he had many favourites with a facility that never failed or that failed but just enough to pick itself up at a touch from his fitful voice she could play anything she could play everything always shockingly she of course insisted but always by his own vague measure very much as if she might slim sinuous and strong and with practised passion have been playing lawn tennis or endlessly and rhythmically waltzing his love of music unlike his other loves owned to vaguenesses but while on his comparatively shaded sofa and smoking smoking always smoking in the great fawns drawing room as everywhere the cigars of his youth rank with associations while i say he so listened to charlotte s piano where the score was ever absent but between the lighted candles the picture distinct the vagueness spread itself about him like some boundless carpet a surface delightfully soft to the pressure of his interest it was a manner of passing the time that rather replaced conversation but the air at the end none the less before they separated had a way of seeming full of the echoes of talk they separated in the hushed house not quite easily yet not quite awkwardly either with tapers that twinkled in the large dark spaces and for the most part so late that the last solemn servant had been dismissed for the night late as it was on a particular evening toward the end of october there had been a full word or two dropped into the still stirring sea of other voices a word or two that affected our friend even at the moment and rather oddly as louder and rounder than any previous sound and then he had lingered under pretext of an opened window to be made secure after taking leave of his companion in the hall and watching her glimmer away up the staircase he had for himself another impulse than to go to bed picking up a hat in the hall slipping his arms into a sleeveless cape and lighting still another cigar he turned out upon the terrace through one of the long drawing room windows and moved to and fro there for an hour beneath the sharp autumn stars it was where he had walked in the afternoon sun with fanny assingham and the sense of that other hour the sense of the suggestive woman herself was before him again as in spite of all the previous degustation we have hinted at it had not yet been he thought in a loose an almost agitated order of many things the power that was in them to agitate having been part of his conviction that he should not soon sleep he truly felt for a while that he should never sleep again till something had come to him some light some idea some mere happy word perhaps that he had begun to want but had been till now and especially the last day or two vainly groping for can you really then come if we start early that was practically all he had said to the girl as she took up her bedroom light and why in the world not when i ve nothing else to do and should besides so immensely like it this had as definitely been on her side the limit of the little scene there had in fact been nothing to call a scene even of the littlest at all though he perhaps didn t quite know why something like the menace of one hadn t proceeded from her stopping half way upstairs to turn and say as she looked down on him that she promised to content herself for their journey with a toothbrush and a sponge there hovered about him at all events while he walked appearances already familiar as well as two or three that were new and not the least vivid of the former connected itself with that sense of being treated with consideration which had become for him as we have noted one of the minor yet so far as there were any such quite one of the compensatory incidents of being a father in law it had struck him up to now that this particular balm was a mixture of which amerigo as through some hereditary privilege alone possessed the secret so that he found himself wondering if it had come to charlotte who had unmistakably acquired it through the young man s having amiably passed it on she made use for her so quietly grateful host however this might be of quite the same shades of attention and recognition was mistress in an equal degree of the regulated the developed art of placing him high in the scale of importance that was even for his own thought a clumsy way of expressing the element of similarity in the agreeable effect they each produced on him and it held him for a little only because this coincidence in their felicity caused him vaguely to connect or associate them in the matter of tradition training tact or whatever else one might call it it might almost have been if such a link between them was to be imagined that amerigo had a little coached or incited their young friend or perhaps rather that she had simply as one of the signs of the general perfection fanny assingham commended in her profited by observing during her short opportunity before the start of the travellers the pleasant application by the prince of his personal system he might wonder what exactly it was that they so resembled each other in treating him like from what noble and propagated convention in cases in which the exquisite importance was to be neither too grossly attributed nor too grossly denied they had taken their specific lesson but the difficulty was here of course that one could really never know couldn t know without having been one s self a personage whether a pope a king a president a peer a general or just a beautiful author before such a question as before several others when they recurred he would come to a pause leaning his arms on the old parapet and losing himself in a far excursion he had as to so many of the matters in hand a divided view and this was exactly what made him reach out in his unrest for some idea lurking in the vast freshness of the night at the breath of which disparities would submit to fusion and so spreading beneath him make him feel that he floated what he kept finding himself return to disturbingly enough was the reflection deeper than anything else that in forming a new and intimate tie he should in a manner abandon or at the best signally relegate his daughter he should reduce to definite form the idea that he had lost her as was indeed inevitable by her own marriage he should reduce to definite form the idea of his having incurred an injury or at the best an inconvenience that required some makeweight and deserved some amends and he should do this the more which was the great point that he should appear to adopt in doing it the sentiment in fact the very conviction entertained and quite sufficiently expressed by maggie herself in her beautiful generosity as to what he had suffered putting it with extravagance at her hands if she put it with extravagance the extravagance was yet sincere for it came which she put with extravagance too from her persistence always in thinking feeling talking about him as young he had had glimpses of moments when to hear her thus in her absolutely unforced compunction one would have supposed the special edge of the wrong she had done him to consist in his having still before him years and years to groan under it she had sacrificed a parent the pearl of parents no older than herself it wouldn t so much have mattered if he had been of common parental age that he wasn t that he was just her extraordinary equal and contemporary this was what added to her act the long train of its effect light broke for him at last indeed quite as a consequence of the fear of breathing a chill upon this luxuriance of her spiritual garden as at a turn of his labyrinth he saw his issue which opened out so wide for the minute that he held his breath with wonder he was afterwards to recall how just then the autumn night seemed to clear to a view in which the whole place everything round him the wide terrace where he stood the others with their steps below the gardens the park the lake the circling woods lay there as under some strange midnight sun it all met him during these instants as a vast expanse of discovery a world that looked so lighted extraordinarily new and in which familiar objects had taken on a distinctness that as if it had been a loud a spoken pretension to beauty interest importance to he scarce knew what gave them an inordinate quantity of character and verily an inordinate size this hallucination or whatever he might have called it was brief but it lasted long enough to leave him gasping the gasp of admiration had by this time however lost itself in an intensity that quickly followed the way the wonder of it since wonder was in question truly had been the strange delay of his vision he had these several days groped and groped for an object that lay at his feet and as to which his blindness came from his stupidly looking beyond it had sat all the while at his hearth stone whence it now gazed up in his face once he had recognised it there everything became coherent the sharp point to which all his light converged was that the whole call of his future to him as a father would be in his so managing that maggie would less and less appear to herself to have forsaken him and it not only wouldn t be decently humane decently possible not to make this relief easy to her the idea shone upon him more than that as exciting inspiring uplifting it fell in so beautifully with what might be otherwise possible it stood there absolutely confronted with the material way in which it might be met the way in which it might be met was by his putting his child at peace and the way to put her at peace was to provide for his future that is for hers by marriage by a marriage as good speaking proportionately as hers had been as he fairly inhaled this measure of refreshment he tasted the meaning of recent agitations he had seen that charlotte could contribute what he hadn t seen was what she could contribute to when it had all supremely cleared up and he had simply settled this service to his daughter well before him as the proper direction of his young friend s leisure the cool darkness had again closed round him but his moral lucidity was constituted it wasn t only moreover that the word with a click so fitted the riddle but that the riddle in such perfection fitted the word he might have been equally in want and yet not have had his remedy oh if charlotte didn t accept him of course the remedy would fail but as everything had fallen together it was at least there to be tried and success would be great that was his last throb if the measure of relief effected for maggie should at all prove to have been given by his own actual sense of felicity he really didn t know when in his life he had thought of anything happier to think of it merely for himself would have been even as he had just lately felt even doing all justice to that condition yes impossible but there was a grand difference in thinking of it for his child xii it was at brighton above all that this difference came out it was during the three wonderful days he spent there with charlotte that he had acquainted himself further though doubtless not even now quite completely with the merits of his majestic scheme and while moreover to begin with he still but held his vision in place steadying it fairly with his hands as he had often steadied for inspection a precarious old pot or kept a glazed picture in its right relation to the light the other the outer presumptions in his favour those independent of what he might himself contribute and that therefore till he should speak remained necessarily vague that quantity i say struck him as positively multiplying as putting on in the fresh brighton air and on the sunny brighton front a kind of tempting palpability he liked in this preliminary stage to feel that he should be able to speak and that he would the word itself being romantic pressing for him the spring of association with stories and plays where handsome and ardent young men in uniforms tights cloaks high boots had it in soliloquies ever on their lips and the sense on the first day that he should probably have taken the great step before the second was over conduced already to make him say to his companion that they must spend more than their mere night or two at his ease on the ground of what was before him he at all events definitely desired to be and it was strongly his impression that he was proceeding step by step he was acting it kept coming back to that not in the dark but in the high golden morning not in precipitation flurry fever dangers these of the path of passion properly so called but with the deliberation of a plan a plan that might be a thing of less joy than a passion but that probably would in compensation for that loss be found to have the essential property to wear even the decent dignity of reaching further and of providing for more contingencies the season was in local parlance on the elements were assembled the big windy hotel the draughty social hall swarmed with types in charlotte s constant phrase and resounded with a din in which the wild music of gilded and befrogged bands croatian dalmatian carpathian violently exotic and nostalgic was distinguished as struggling against the perpetual popping of corks much of this would decidedly have disconcerted our friends if it hadn t all happened more preponderantly to give them the brighter surprise the noble privacy of fawns had left them had left mr verver at least with a little accumulated sum of tolerance to spend on the high pitch and high colour of the public sphere fawns as it had been for him and as maggie and fanny assingham had both attested was out of the world whereas the scene actually about him with the very sea a mere big booming medium for excursions and aquariums affected him as so plump in the conscious centre that nothing could have been more complete for representing that pulse of life which they had come to unanimity at home on the subject of their advisedly not hereafter forgetting the pulse of life was what charlotte in her way at home had lately reproduced and there were positively current hours when it might have been open to her companion to feel himself again indebted to her for introductions he had brought her to put it crudely but it was almost as if she were herself in her greater gaiety her livelier curiosity and intensity her readier happier irony taking him about and showing him the place no one really when he came to think had ever taken him about before it had always been he of old who took others and who in particular took maggie this quickly fell into its relation with him as part of an experience marking for him no doubt what people call considerately a time of life a new and pleasant order a flattered passive state that might become why shouldn t it one of the comforts of the future mr gutermann seuss proved on the second day our friend had waited till then a remarkably genial a positively lustrous young man occupying a small neat house in a quarter of the place remote from the front and living as immediate and striking signs testified in the bosom of his family our visitors found themselves introduced by the operation of close contiguity to a numerous group of ladies and gentlemen older and younger and of children larger and smaller who mostly affected them as scarce less anointed for hospitality and who produced at first the impression of a birthday party of some anniversary gregariously and religiously kept though they subsequently fell into their places as members of one quiet domestic circle preponderantly and directly indebted for their being in fact to mr gutermann seuss to the casual eye a mere smart and shining youth of less than thirty summers faultlessly appointed in every particular he yet stood among his progeny eleven in all as he confessed without a sigh eleven little brown clear faces yet with such impersonal old eyes astride of such impersonal old noses while he entertained the great american collector whom he had so long hoped he might meet and whose charming companion the handsome frank familiar young lady presumably mrs verver noticed the graduated offspring noticed the fat ear ringed aunts and the glossy cockneyfied familiar uncles inimitable of accent and assumption and of an attitude of cruder intention than that of the head of the firm noticed the place in short noticed the treasure produced noticed everything as from the habit of a person finding her account at any time according to a wisdom well learned of life in almost any funny impression it really came home to her friend on the spot that this free range of observation in her picking out the frequent funny with extraordinary promptness would verily henceforth make a different thing for him of such experiences of the customary hunt for the possible prize the inquisitive play of his accepted monomania which different thing could probably be a lighter and perhaps thereby a somewhat more boisterously refreshing form of sport such omens struck him as vivid in any case when mr gutermann seuss with a sharpness of discrimination he had at first scarce seemed to promise invited his eminent couple into another room before the threshold of which the rest of the tribe unanimously faltering dropped out of the scene the treasure itself here the objects on behalf of which mr verver s interest had been booked established quickly enough their claim to engage the latter s attention yet at what point of his past did our friend s memory looking back and back catch him in any such place thinking so much less of wares artfully paraded than of some other and quite irrelevant presence such places were not strange to him when they took the form of bourgeois back parlours a trifle ominously grey and grim from their north light at watering places prevailingly homes of humbug or even when they wore some aspect still less if not perhaps still more insidious he had been everywhere pried and prowled everywhere going on occasion so far as to risk he believed life health and the very bloom of honour but where while precious things extracted one by one from thrice locked yet often vulgar drawers and soft satchels of old oriental ilk were impressively ranged before him had he till now let himself in consciousness wander like one of the vague he didn t betray it ah that he knew but two recognitions took place for him at once and one of them suffered a little in sweetness by the confusion mr gutermann seuss had truly for the crisis the putting down of his cards a rare manner he was perfect master of what not to say to such a personage as mr verver while the particular importance that dispenses with chatter was diffused by his movements themselves his repeated act of passage between a featureless mahogany meuble and a table so virtuously disinterested as to look fairly smug under a cotton cloth of faded maroon and indigo all redolent of patriarchal teas the damascene tiles successively and oh so tenderly unmuffled and revealed lay there at last in their full harmony and their venerable splendour but the tribute of appreciation and decision was while the spectator considered simplified to a point that but just failed of representing levity on the part of a man who had always acknowledged without shame in such affairs the intrinsic charm of what was called discussion the infinitely ancient the immemorial amethystine blue of the glaze scarcely more meant to be breathed upon it would seem than the cheek of royalty this property of the ordered and matched array had inevitably all its determination for him but his submission was perhaps for the first time in his life of the quick mind alone the process really itself in its way as fine as the perfection perceived and admired every inch of the rest of him being given to the foreknowledge that an hour or two later he should have spoken the burning of his ships therefore waited too near to let him handle his opportunity with his usual firm and sentient fingers waited somehow in the predominance of charlotte s very person in her being there exactly as she was capable as mr gutermann seuss himself was capable of the right felicity of silence but with an embracing ease through it all that made deferred criticism as fragrant as some joy promised a lover by his mistress or as a big bridal bouquet held patiently behind her he couldn t otherwise have explained surely why he found himself thinking to his enjoyment of so many other matters than the felicity of his acquisition and the figure of his cheque quite equally high any more than why later on with their return to the room in which they had been received and the renewed encompassment of the tribe he felt quite merged in the elated circle formed by the girl s free response to the collective caress of all the shining eyes and by her genial acceptance of the heavy cake and port wine that as she was afterwards to note added to their transaction for a finish the touch of some mystic rite of old jewry this characterisation came from her as they walked away walked together in the waning afternoon back to the breezy sea and the bustling front back to the nimble and the flutter and the shining shops that sharpened the grin of solicitation on the mask of night they were walking thus as he felt nearer and nearer to where he should see his ships burn and it was meanwhile for him quite as if this red glow would impart at the harmonious hour a lurid grandeur to his good faith it was meanwhile too a sign of the kind of sensibility often playing up in him that fabulous as this truth may sound he found a sentimental link an obligation of delicacy or perhaps even one of the penalties of its opposite in his having exposed her to the north light the quite properly hard business light of the room in which they had been alone with the treasure and its master she had listened to the name of the sum he was capable of looking in the face given the relation of intimacy with him she had already beyond all retractation accepted the stir of the air produced at the other place by that high figure struck him as a thing that from the moment she had exclaimed or protested as little as he himself had apologised left him but one thing more to do a man of decent feeling didn t thrust his money a huge lump of it in such a way under a poor girl s nose a girl whose poverty was after a fashion the very basis of her enjoyment of his hospitality without seeing logically a responsibility attached and this was to remain none the less true for the fact that twenty minutes later after he had applied his torch applied it with a sign or two of insistence what might definitely result failed to be immediately clear he had spoken spoken as they sat together on the out of the way bench observed during one of their walks and kept for the previous quarter of the present hour well in his memory s eye the particular spot to which between intense pauses and intenser advances he had all the while consistently led her below the great consolidated cliff well on to where the city of stucco sat most architecturally perched with the rumbling beach and the rising tide and the freshening stars in front and above the safe sense of the whole place yet prevailed in lamps and seats and flagged walks hovering also overhead in the close neighbourhood of a great replete community about to assist anew at the removal of dish covers we ve had as it seems to me such quite beautiful days together that i hope it won t come to you too much as a shock when i ask if you think you could regard me with any satisfaction as a husband as if he had known she wouldn t she of course couldn t at all gracefully and whether or no reply with a rush he had said a little more quite as he had felt he must in thinking it out in advance he had put the question on which there was no going back and which represented thereby the sacrifice of his vessels and what he further said was to stand for the redoubled thrust of flame that would make combustion sure this isn t sudden to me and i ve wondered at moments if you haven t felt me coming to it i ve been coming ever since we left fawns i really started while we were there he spoke slowly giving her as he desired time to think all the more that it was making her look at him steadily and making her also in a remarkable degree look well while she did so a large and so far a happy consequence she wasn t at all events shocked which he had glanced at but for a handsome humility and he would give her as many minutes as she liked you mustn t think i m forgetting that i m not young oh that isn t so it s i that am old you are young this was what she had at first answered and quite in the tone too of having taken her minutes it had not been wholly to the point but it had been kind which was what he most wanted and she kept for her next words to kindness kept to her clear lowered voice and unshrinking face to me too it thoroughly seems that these days have been beautiful i shouldn t be grateful to them if i couldn t more or less have imagined their bringing us to this she affected him somehow as if she had advanced a step to meet him and yet were at the same time standing still it only meant however doubtless that she was gravely and reasonably thinking as he exactly desired to make her if she would but think enough she would probably think to suit him it seems to me she went on that it s for you to be sure ah but i am sure said adam verver on matters of importance i never speak when i m not so if you can yourself face such a union you needn t in the least trouble she had another pause and she might have been felt as facing it while through lamplight and dusk through the breath of the mild slightly damp southwest she met his eyes without evasion yet she had at the end of another minute debated only to the extent of saying i won t pretend i don t think it would be good for me to marry good for me i mean she pursued because i m so awfully unattached i should like to be a little less adrift i should like to have a home i should like to have an existence i should like to have a motive for one thing more than another a motive outside of myself in fact she said so sincerely that it almost showed pain yet so lucidly that it almost showed humour in fact you know i want to be married it s well it s the condition the condition he was just vague it s the state i mean i don t like my own miss among us all is too dreadful except for a shopgirl i don t want to be a horrible english old maid oh you want to be taken care of very well then i ll do it i dare say it s very much that only i don t see why for what i speak of she smiled for a mere escape from my state i need do quite so much so much as marry me in particular her smile was as for true directness i might get what i want for less you think it so much for you to do yes she presently said i think it s a great deal then it was that though she was so gentle so quite perfect with him and he felt he had come on far then it was that of a sudden something seemed to fail and he didn t quite know where they were there rose for him with this the fact to be sure of their disparity deny it as mercifully and perversely as she would he might have been her father of course yes that s my disadvantage i m not the natural i m so far from being the ideal match to your youth and your beauty i ve the drawback that you ve seen me always so inevitably in such another light but she gave a slow headshake that made contradiction soft made it almost sad in fact as from having to be so complete and he had already before she spoke the dim vision of some objection in her mind beside which the one he had named was light and which therefore must be strangely deep you don t understand me it s of all that it is for you to do it s of that i m thinking oh with this for him the thing was clearer then you needn t think i know enough what it is for me to do but she shook her head again i doubt if you know i doubt if you can and why not please when i ve had you so before me that i m old has at least that fact about it to the good that i ve known you long and from far back do you think you ve known me asked charlotte stant he hesitated for the tone of it and her look with it might have made him doubt just these things in themselves however with all the rest with his fixed purpose now his committed deed the fine pink glow projected forward of his ships behind him definitely blazing and crackling this quantity was to push him harder than any word of her own could warn him all that she was herself moreover was so lighted to its advantage by the pink glow he wasn t rabid but he wasn t either as a man of a proper spirit to be frightened what is that then if i accept it but as strong a reason as i can want for just learning to know you she faced him always kept it up as for honesty and yet at the same time in her odd way as for mercy how can you tell whether if you did you would it was ambiguous for an instant as she showed she felt i mean when it s a question of learning one learns sometimes too late i think it s a question he promptly enough made answer of liking you the more just for your saying these things you should make something he added of my liking you i make everything but are you sure of having exhausted all other ways this of a truth enlarged his gaze but what other ways why you ve more ways of being kind than anyone i ever knew take it then he answered that i m simply putting them all together for you she looked at him on this long again still as if it shouldn t be said she hadn t given him time or had withdrawn from his view so to speak a single inch of her surface this at least she was fully to have exposed it represented her as oddly conscientious and he scarce knew in what sense it affected him on the whole however with admiration you re very very honourable it s just what i want to be i don t see she added why you re not right i don t see why you re not happy as you are i can not ask myself i can not ask you she went on if you re really as much at liberty as your universal generosity leads you to assume oughtn t we she asked to think a little of others oughtn t i at least in loyalty at any rate in delicacy to think of maggie with which intensely gentle so as not to appear too much to teach him his duty she explained she s everything to you she has always been are you so certain that there s room in your life for another daughter is that what you mean she had not hung upon it long but he had quickly taken her up he had not however disconcerted her for another young woman very much of her age and whose relation to her has always been so different from what our marrying would make it for another companion said charlotte stant can t a man be all his life then he almost fiercely asked anything but a father but he went on before she could answer you talk about differences but they ve been already made as no one knows better than maggie she feels the one she made herself by her own marriage made i mean for me she constantly thinks of it it allows her no rest to put her at peace is therefore he explained what i m trying with you to do i can t do it alone but i can do it with your help you can make her he said positively happy about me about you she thoughtfully echoed but what can i make her about herself oh if she s at ease about me the rest will take care of itself the case he declared is in your hands you ll effectually put out of her mind that i feel she has abandoned me interest certainly now was what he had kindled in her face but it was all the more honourable to her as he had just called it that she should want to see each of the steps of his conviction if you ve been driven to the likes of me mayn t it show that you ve felt truly forsaken well i m willing to suggest that if i can show at the same time that i feel consoled but have you she demanded really felt so he hesitated consoled forsaken no i haven t but if it s her idea if it was her idea in short that was enough this enunciation of motive the next moment however sounded to him perhaps slightly thin so that he gave it another touch that is if it s my idea i happen you see to like my idea well it s beautiful and wonderful but isn t it possibly charlotte asked not quite enough to marry me for why so my dear child isn t a man s idea usually what he does marry for charlotte considering looked as if this might perhaps be a large question or at all events something of an extension of one they were immediately concerned with doesn t that a good deal depend on the sort of thing it may be she suggested that about marriage ideas as he called them might differ with which however giving no more time to it she sounded another question don t you appear rather to put it to me that i may accept your offer for maggie s sake somehow she turned it over i don t so clearly see her quite so much finding reassurance or even quite so much needing it do you then make nothing at all of her having been so ready to leave us ah charlotte on the contrary made much she was ready to leave us because she had to be from the moment the prince wanted it she could only go with him perfectly so that if you see your way she will be able to go with him in future as much as she likes charlotte appeared to examine for a minute in maggie s interest this privilege the result of which was a limited concession you ve certainly worked it out of course i ve worked it out that s exactly what i have done she hadn t for a long time been so happy about anything as at your being there with me i was to be with you said charlotte for her security well adam verver rang out this is her security you ve only if you can t see it to ask her ask her the girl echoed it in wonder certainly in so many words telling her you don t believe me still she debated do you mean write it to her quite so immediately to morrow oh i don t think i can write it said charlotte stant when i write to her and she looked amused for so different a shade it s about the principino s appetite and dr brady s visits very good then put it to her face to face we ll go straight to paris to meet them charlotte at this rose with a movement that was like a small cry but her unspoken sense lost itself while she stood with her eyes on him he keeping his seat as for the help it gave him a little to make his appeal go up presently however a new sense had come to her and she covered him kindly with the expression of it i do think you know you must rather like me thank you said adam verver you will put it to her yourself then she had another hesitation we go over you say to meet them as soon as we can get back to fawns and wait there for them if necessary till they come wait a at fawns wait in paris that will be charming in itself you take me to pleasant places she turned it over you propose to me beautiful things it rests but with you to make them beautiful and pleasant you ve made brighton ah she almost tenderly protested with what i m doing now you re promising me now what i want aren t you promising me he pressed getting up aren t you promising me to abide by what maggie says oh she wanted to be sure she was do you mean she ll ask it of me it gave him indeed as by communication a sense of the propriety of being himself certain yet what was he but certain she ll speak to you she ll speak to you for me this at last then seemed to satisfy her very good may we wait again to talk of it till she has done so he showed with his hands down in his pockets and his shoulders expressively up a certain disappointment soon enough none the less his gentleness was all back and his patience once more exemplary of course i give you time especially he smiled as it s time that i shall be spending with you our keeping on together will help you perhaps to see to see i mean how i need you i already see said charlotte how you ve persuaded yourself you do but she had to repeat it that isn t unfortunately all well then how you ll make maggie right right she echoed it as if the word went far and o oh she still critically murmured as they moved together away xiii he had talked to her of their waiting in paris a week later but on the spot there this period of patience suffered no great strain he had written to his daughter not indeed from brighton but directly after their return to fawns where they spent only forty eight hours before resuming their journey and maggie s reply to his news was a telegram from rome delivered to him at noon of their fourth day and which he brought out to charlotte who was seated at that moment in the court of the hotel where they had agreed that he should join her for their proceeding together to the noontide meal his letter at fawns a letter of several pages and intended lucidly unreservedly in fact all but triumphantly to inform had proved on his sitting down to it and a little to his surprise not quite so simple a document to frame as even his due consciousness of its weight of meaning had allowed him to assume this doubtless however only for reasons naturally latent in the very wealth of that consciousness which contributed to his message something of their own quality of impatience the main result of their talk for the time had been a difference in his relation to his young friend as well as a difference equally sensible in her relation to himself and this in spite of his not having again renewed his undertaking to speak to her so far even as to tell her of the communication despatched to rome delicacy a delicacy more beautiful still all the delicacy she should want reigned between them it being rudimentary in their actual order that she mustn t be further worried until maggie should have put her at her ease it was just the delicacy however that in paris which suggestively was brighton at a hundredfold higher pitch made between him and his companion the tension made the suspense made what he would have consented perhaps to call the provisional peculiarity of present conditions these elements acted in a manner of their own imposing and involving under one head many abstentions and precautions twenty anxieties and reminders things verily he would scarce have known how to express and yet creating for them at every step an acceptance of their reality he was hanging back with charlotte till another person should intervene for their assistance and yet they had by what had already occurred been carried on to something it was out of the power of other persons to make either less or greater common conventions that was what was odd had to be on this basis more thought of those common conventions that previous to the passage by the brighton strand he had so enjoyed the sense of their overlooking the explanation would have been he supposed or would have figured it with less of unrest that paris had in its way deeper voices and warnings so that if you went at all far there it laid bristling traps as they might have been viewed all smothered in flowers for your going further still there were strange appearances in the air and before you knew it you might be unmistakably matching them since he wished therefore to match no appearance but that of a gentleman playing with perfect fairness any game in life he might be called to he found himself on the receipt of maggie s missive rejoicing with a certain inconsistency the announcement made her from home had in the act cost some biting of his pen to sundry parts of him his personal modesty his imagination of her prepared state for so quick a jump it didn t much matter which and yet he was more eager than not for the drop of delay and for the quicker transitions promised by the arrival of the imminent pair there was after all a hint of offence to a man of his age in being taken as they said at the shops on approval maggie certainly would have been as far as charlotte herself from positively desiring this and charlotte on her side as far as maggie from holding him light as a real value she made him fidget thus poor girl but from generous rigour of conscience these allowances of his spirit were all the same consistent with a great gladness at the sight of the term of his ordeal for it was the end of his seeming to agree that questions and doubts had a place the more he had inwardly turned the matter over the more it had struck him that they had in truth only an ugliness what he could have best borne as he now believed would have been charlotte s simply saying to him that she didn t like him enough this he wouldn t have enjoyed but he would quite have understood it and been able ruefully to submit she did like him enough nothing to contradict that had come out for him so that he was restless for her as well as for himself she looked at him hard a moment when he handed her his telegram and the look for what he fancied a dim shy fear in it gave him perhaps his best moment of conviction that as a man so to speak he properly pleased her he said nothing the words sufficiently did it for him doing it again better still as charlotte who had left her chair at his approach murmured them out we start to night to bring you all our love and joy and sympathy there they were the words and what did she want more she didn t however as she gave him back the little unfolded leaf say they were enough though he saw the next moment that her silence was probably not disconnected from her having just visibly turned pale her extraordinarily fine eyes as it was his present theory that he had always thought them shone at him the more darkly out of this change of colour and she had again with it her apparent way of subjecting herself for explicit honesty and through her willingness to face him to any view he might take all at his ease and even to wantonness of the condition he produced in her as soon as he perceived that emotion kept her soundless he knew himself deeply touched since it proved that little as she professed she had been beautifully hoping they stood there a minute while he took in from this sign that yes then certainly she liked him enough liked him enough to make him old as he was ready to brand himself flush for the pleasure of it the pleasure of it accordingly made him speak first do you begin a little to be satisfied still however she had to think we ve hurried them you see why so breathless a start because they want to congratulate us they want said adam verver to see our happiness she wondered again and this time also for him as publicly as possible so much as that do you think it s too much she continued to think plainly they weren t to have started for another week well what then isn t our situation worth the little sacrifice we ll go back to rome as soon as you like with them this seemed to hold her as he had previously seen her held just a trifle inscrutably by his allusions to what they would do together on a certain contingency worth it the little sacrifice for whom for us naturally yes she said we want to see them for our reasons that is she rather dimly smiled you do and you do my dear too he bravely declared yes then i do too she after an instant ungrudging enough acknowledged for us however something depends on it rather but does nothing depend on it for them what can from the moment that as appears they don t want to nip us in the bud i can imagine their rushing up to prevent us but an enthusiasm for us that can wait so very little such intense eagerness i confess she went on more than a little puzzles me you may think me she also added ungracious and suspicious but the prince can t at all want to come back so soon he wanted quite too intensely to get away mr verver considered well hasn t he been away yes just long enough to see how he likes it besides said charlotte he may not be able to join in the rosy view of our case that you impute to her it can t in the least have appeared to him hitherto a matter of course that you should give his wife a bouncing stepmother adam verver at this looked grave i m afraid then he ll just have to accept from us whatever his wife accepts and accept it if he can imagine no better reason just because she does that he declared will have to do for him his tone made her for a moment meet his face after which let me she abruptly said see it again taking from him the folded leaf that she had given back and he had kept in his hand isn t the whole thing she asked when she had read it over perhaps but a way like another for their gaining time he again stood staring but the next minute with that upward spring of his shoulders and that downward pressure of his pockets which she had already more than once at disconcerted moments determined in him he turned sharply away and wandered from her in silence he looked about in his small despair he crossed the hotel court which overarched and glazed muffled against loud sounds and guarded against crude sights heated gilded draped almost carpeted with exotic trees in tubs exotic ladies in chairs the general exotic accent and presence suspended as with wings folded or feebly fluttering in the superior the supreme the inexorably enveloping parisian medium resembled some critical apartment of large capacity some dental medical surgical waiting room a scene of mixed anxiety and desire preparatory for gathered barbarians to the due amputation or extraction of excrescences and redundancies of barbarism he went as far as the porte cochere took counsel afresh of his usual optimism sharpened even somehow just here by the very air he tasted and then came back smiling to charlotte it is incredible to you that when a man is still as much in love as amerigo his most natural impulse should be to feel what his wife feels to believe what she believes to want what she wants in the absence that is of special impediments to his so doing the manner of it operated she acknowledged with no great delay this natural possibility no nothing is incredible to me of people immensely in love well isn t amerigo immensely in love she hesitated but as for the right expression of her sense of the degree but she after all adopted mr verver s immensely then there you are she had another smile however she wasn t there quite yet that isn t all that s wanted but what more why that his wife shall have made him really believe that she really believes with which charlotte became still more lucidly logical the reality of his belief will depend in such a case on the reality of hers the prince may for instance now she went on have made out to his satisfaction that maggie may mainly desire to abound in your sense whatever it is you do he may remember that he has never seen her do anything else well said adam verver what kind of a warning will he have found in that to what catastrophe will he have observed such a disposition in her to lead just to this one with which she struck him as rising straighter and clearer before him than she had done even yet our little question itself her appearance had in fact at the moment such an effect on him that he could answer but in marvelling mildness hadn t we better wait a while till we call it a catastrophe her rejoinder to this was to wait though by no means as long as he meant when at the end of her minute she spoke however it was mildly too what would you like dear friend to wait for it lingered between them in the air this demand and they exchanged for the time a look which might have made each of them seem to have been watching in the other the signs of its overt irony these were indeed immediately so visible in mr verver s face that as if a little ashamed of having so markedly produced them and as if also to bring out at last under pressure something she had all the while been keeping back she took a jump to pure plain reason you haven t noticed for yourself but i can t quite help noticing that in spite of what you assume we assume if you like maggie wires her joy only to you she makes no sign of its overflow to me it was a point and staring a moment he took account of it but he had as before his presence of mind to say nothing of his kindly humour why you complain of the very thing that s most charmingly conclusive she treats us already as one clearly now for the girl in spite of lucidity and logic there was something in the way he said things she faced him in all her desire to please him and then her word quite simply and definitely showed it i do like you you know well what could this do but stimulate his humour i see what s the matter with you you won t be quiet till you ve heard from the prince himself i think the happy man added that i ll go and secretly wire to him that you d like reply paid a few words for yourself it could apparently but encourage her further to smile reply paid for him you mean or for me oh i ll pay with pleasure anything back for you as many words as you like and he went on to keep it up not requiring either to see your message she could take it visibly as he meant it should you require to see the prince s not a bit you can keep that also to yourself on his speaking however as if his transmitting the hint were a real question she appeared to consider and almost as if for good taste that the joke had gone far enough it doesn t matter unless he speaks of his own movement and why should it be she asked a thing that would occur to him i really think mr verver concurred that it naturally wouldn t he doesn t know you re morbid she just wondered but she agreed no he hasn t yet found it out perhaps he will but he hasn t yet and i m willing to give him meanwhile the benefit of the doubt so with this the situation to her view would appear to have cleared had she not too quickly had one of her restless relapses maggie however does know i m morbid she hasn t the benefit well said adam verver a little wearily at last i think i feel that you ll hear from her yet it had even fairly come over him under recurrent suggestion that his daughter s omission was surprising and maggie had never in her life been wrong for more than three minutes oh it isn t that i hold that i ve a right to it charlotte the next instant rather oddly qualified and the observation itself gave him a further push very well i shall like it myself at this then as if moved by his way of constantly and more or less against his own contention coming round to her she showed how she could also always and not less gently come half way i speak of it only as the missing grace the grace that s in everything that maggie does it isn t my due she kept it up but taking from you that we may still expect it it will have the touch it will be beautiful then come out to breakfast mr verver had looked at his watch it will be here when we get back if it isn t and charlotte smiled as she looked about for a feather boa that she had laid down on descending from her room if it isn t it will have had but that slight fault he saw her boa on the arm of the chair from which she had moved to meet him and after he had fetched it raising it to make its charming softness brush his face for it was a wondrous product of paris purchased under his direct auspices the day before he held it there a minute before giving it up will you promise me then to be at peace she looked while she debated at his admirable present i promise you quite for ever quite for ever remember he went on to justify his demand remember that in wiring you she ll naturally speak even more for her husband than she has done in wiring me it was only at a word that charlotte had a demur naturally why our marriage puts him for you you see or puts you for him into a new relation whereas it leaves his relation to me unchanged it therefore gives him more to say to you about it about its making me his stepmother in law or whatever i should become over which for a little she not undivertedly mused yes there may easily be enough for a gentleman to say to a young woman about that well amerigo can always be according to the case either as funny or as serious as you like and whichever he may be for you in sending you a message he ll be it all and then as the girl with one of her so deeply and oddly yet so tenderly critical looks at him failed to take up the remark he found himself moved as by a vague anxiety to add a question don t you think he s charming oh charming said charlotte stant if he weren t i shouldn t mind no more should i her friend harmoniously returned ah but you don t mind you don t have to you don t have to i mean as i have it s the last folly ever to care in an anxious way the least particle more than one is absolutely forced if i were you she went on if i had in my life for happiness and power and peace even a small fraction of what you have it would take a great deal to make me waste my worry i don t know she said what in the world that didn t touch my luck i should trouble my head about i quite understand you yet doesn t it just depend mr verver asked on what you call one s luck it s exactly my luck that i m talking about i shall be as sublime as you like when you ve made me all right it s only when one is right that one really has the things you speak of it isn t they he explained that make one so it s the something else i want that makes them right if you ll give me what i ask you ll see she had taken her boa and thrown it over her shoulders and her eyes while she still delayed had turned from him engaged by another interest though the court was by this time the hour of dispersal for luncheon so forsaken that they would have had it for free talk should they have been moved to loudness quite to themselves she was ready for their adjournment but she was also aware of a pedestrian youth in uniform a visible emissary of the postes et telegraphes who had approached from the street the small stronghold of the concierge and who presented there a missive taken from the little cartridge box slung over his shoulder the portress meeting him on the threshold met equally across the court charlotte s marked attention to his visit so that within the minute she had advanced to our friends with her cap streamers flying and her smile of announcement as ample as her broad white apron she raised aloft a telegraphic message and as she delivered it sociably discriminated cette fois ci pour madame with which she as genially retreated leaving charlotte in possession charlotte taking it held it at first unopened her eyes had come back to her companion who had immediately and triumphantly greeted it ah there you are she broke the envelope then in silence and for a minute as with the message he himself had put before her studied its contents without a sign he watched her without a question and at last she looked up i ll give you she simply said what you ask the expression of her face was strange but since when had a woman s at moments of supreme surrender not a right to be he took it in with his own long look and his grateful silence so that nothing more for some instants passed between them their understanding sealed itself he already felt that she had made him right but he was in presence too of the fact that maggie had made her so and always therefore without maggie where in fine would he be she united them brought them together as with the click of a silver spring and on the spot with the vision of it his eyes filled charlotte facing him meanwhile with her expression made still stranger by the blur of his gratitude through it all however he smiled what my child does for me through it all as well that is still through the blur he saw charlotte rather than heard her reply she held her paper wide open but her eyes were all for his it isn t maggie it s the prince i say he gaily rang out then it s best of all it s enough thank you for thinking so to which he added it s enough for our question but it isn t is it quite enough for our breakfast dejeunons she stood there however in spite of this appeal her document always before them don t you want to read it he thought not if it satisfies you i don t require it but she gave him as for her conscience another chance you can if you like he hesitated afresh but as for amiability not for curiosity is it funny thus finally she again dropped her eyes on it drawing in her lips a little no i call it grave ah then i don t want it very grave said charlotte stant well what did i tell you of him he asked rejoicing as they started a question for all answer to which before she took his arm the girl thrust her paper crumpled into the pocket of her coat part third xiv charlotte half way up the monumental staircase had begun by waiting alone waiting to be rejoined by her companion who had gone down all the way as in common kindness bound and who his duty performed would know where to find her she was meanwhile though extremely apparent not perhaps absolutely advertised but she would not have cared if she had been so little was it by this time her first occasion of facing society with a consciousness materially with a confidence quite splendidly enriched for a couple of years now she had known as never before what it was to look well to look that is as well as she had always felt from far back that in certain conditions she might on such an evening as this that of a great official party in the full flush of the london spring time the conditions affected her her nerves her senses her imagination as all profusely present so that perhaps at no moment yet had she been so justified of her faith as at the particular instant of our being again concerned with her that of her chancing to glance higher up from where she stood and meeting in consequence the quiet eyes of colonel assingham who had his elbows on the broad balustrade of the great gallery overhanging the staircase and who immediately exchanged with her one of his most artlessly familiar signals this simplicity of his visual attention struck her even with the other things she had to think about as the quietest note in the whole high pitch much in fact as if she had pressed a finger on a chord or a key and created for the number of seconds an arrest of vibration a more muffled thump the sight of him suggested indeed that fanny would be there though so far as opportunity went she had not seen her this was about the limit of what it could suggest the air however had suggestions enough it abounded in them many of them precisely helping to constitute those conditions with which for our young woman the hour was brilliantly crowned she was herself in truth crowned and it all hung together melted together in light and colour and sound the unsurpassed diamonds that her head so happily carried the other jewels the other perfections of aspect and arrangement that made her personal scheme a success the proved private theory that materials to work with had been all she required and that there were none too precious for her to understand and use to which might be added lastly as the strong scented flower of the total sweetness an easy command a high enjoyment of her crisis for a crisis she was ready to take it and this ease it was doubtless that helped her while she waited to the right assurance to the right indifference to the right expression and above all as she felt to the right view of her opportunity for happiness unless indeed the opportunity itself rather were in its mere strange amplitude the producing the precipitating cause the ordered revellers rustling and shining with sweep of train and glitter of star and clink of sword and yet for all this but so imperfectly articulate so vaguely vocal the double stream of the coming and the going flowing together where she stood passed her brushed her treated her to much crude contemplation and now and then to a spasm of speech an offered hand even in some cases to an unencouraged pause but she missed no countenance and invited no protection she fairly liked to be so long as she might just as she was exposed a little to the public no doubt in her unaccompanied state but even if it were a bit brazen careless of queer reflections on the dull polish of london faces and exposed since it was a question of exposure to much more competent recognitions of her own she hoped no one would stop she was positively keeping herself it was her idea to mark in a particular manner the importance of something that had just happened she knew how she should mark it and what she was doing there made already a beginning when presently therefore from her standpoint she saw the prince come back she had an impression of all the place as higher and wider and more appointed for great moments with its dome of lustres lifted its ascents and descents more majestic its marble tiers more vividly overhung its numerosity of royalties foreign and domestic more unprecedented its symbolism of state hospitality both emphasised and refined this was doubtless a large consequence of a fairly familiar cause a considerable inward stir to spring from the mere vision striking as that might be of amerigo in a crowd but she had her reasons she held them there she carried them in fact responsibly and overtly as she carried her head her high tiara her folded fan her indifferent unattended eminence and it was when he reached her and she could taking his arm show herself as placed in her relation that she felt supremely justified it was her notion of course that she gave a glimpse of but few of her grounds for this discrimination indeed of the most evident alone yet she would have been half willing it should be guessed how she drew inspiration drew support in quantity sufficient for almost anything from the individual value that through all the picture her husband s son in law kept for the eye deriving it from his fine unconscious way in the swarming social sum of outshining overlooking and overtopping it was as if in separation even the shortest she half forgot or disbelieved how he affected her sight so that reappearance had in him each time a virtue of its own a kind of disproportionate intensity suggesting his connection with occult sources of renewal what did he do when he was away from her that made him always come back only looking as she would have called it more so superior to any shade of cabotinage he yet almost resembled an actor who between his moments on the stage revisits his dressing room and before the glass pressed by his need of effect retouches his make up the prince was at present for instance though he had quitted her but ten minutes before still more than then the person it pleased her to be left with a truth that had all its force for her while he made her his care for their conspicuous return together to the upper rooms conspicuous beyond any wish they could entertain was what poor wonderful man he couldn t help making it and when she raised her eyes again on the ascent to bob assingham still aloft in his gallery and still looking down at her she was aware that in spite of hovering and warning inward voices she even enjoyed the testimony rendered by his lonely vigil to the lustre she reflected he was always lonely at great parties the dear colonel it wasn t in such places that the seed he sowed at home was ever reaped by him but nobody could have seemed to mind it less to brave it with more bronzed indifference so markedly that he moved about less like one of the guests than like some quite presentable person in charge of the police arrangements or the electric light to mrs verver as will be seen he represented with the perfect good faith of his apparent blankness something definite enough though her bravery was not thereby too blighted for her to feel herself calling him to witness that the only witchcraft her companion had used within the few minutes was that of attending maggie who had withdrawn from the scene to her carriage notified at all events of fanny s probable presence charlotte was for a while after this divided between the sense of it as a fact somehow to reckon with and deal with which was a perception that made in its degree for the prudence the pusillanimity of postponement of avoidance and a quite other feeling an impatience that presently ended by prevailing an eagerness really to be suspected sounded veritably arraigned if only that she might have the bad moment over if only that she might prove to herself let alone to mrs assingham also that she could convert it to good if only in short to be square as they said with her question for herself indeed particularly it wasn t a question but something in her bones told her that fanny would treat it as one and there was truly nothing that from this friend she was not bound in decency to take she might hand things back with every tender precaution with acknowledgments and assurances but she owed it to them in any case and it to all mrs assingham had done for her not to get rid of them without having well unwrapped and turned them over to night as happened and she recognised it more and more with the ebbing minutes as an influence of everything about her to night exactly she would no doubt since she knew why be as firm as she might at any near moment again hope to be for going through that process with the right temper and tone she said after a little to the prince stay with me let no one take you for i want her yes i do want her to see us together and the sooner the better said it to keep her hand on him through constant diversions and made him in fact by saying it profess a momentary vagueness she had to explain to him that it was fanny assingham she wanted to see who clearly would be there since the colonel never either stirred without her or once arrived concerned himself for her fate and she had further after amerigo had met her with see us together why in the world hasn t she often seen us together to inform him that what had elsewhere and otherwise happened didn t now matter and that she at any rate well knew for the occasion what she was about you re strange cara mia he consentingly enough dropped but for whatever strangeness he kept her as they circulated from being waylaid even remarking to her afresh as he had often done before on the help rendered in such situations by the intrinsic oddity of the london squash a thing of vague slow senseless eddies revolving as in fear of some menace of conversation suspended over it the drop of which with some consequent refreshing splash or spatter yet never took place of course she was strange this as they went charlotte knew for herself how could she be anything else when the situation holding her and holding him for that matter just as much had so the stamp of it she had already accepted her consciousness as we have already noted that a crisis for them all was in the air and when such hours were not depressing which was the form indeed in which she had mainly known them they were apparently in a high degree exhilarating later on in a corner to which at sight of an empty sofa mrs assingham had after a single attentive arrest led her with a certain earnestness this vision of the critical was much more sharpened than blurred fanny had taken it from her yes she was there with amerigo alone maggie having come with them and then within ten minutes changed her mind repented and departed so you re staying on together without her the elder woman had asked and it was charlotte s answer to this that had determined for them quite indeed according to the latter s expectation the need of some seclusion and her companion s pounce at the sofa they were staying on together alone and oh distinctly it was alone that maggie had driven away her father as usual not having managed to come as usual mrs assingham had seemed to wonder mr verver s reluctances not having she in fact quite intimated hitherto struck her charlotte responded at any rate that his indisposition to go out had lately much increased even though to night as she admitted he had pleaded his not feeling well maggie had wished to stay with him for the prince and she dining out had afterwards called in portland place whence in the event they had brought her charlotte on maggie had come but to oblige her father she had urged the two others to go without her then she had yielded for the time to mr verver s persuasion but here when they had after the long wait in the carriage fairly got in here once up the stairs with the rooms before them remorse had ended by seizing her she had listened to no other remonstrance and at present therefore as charlotte put it the two were doubtless making together a little party at home but it was all right so charlotte also put it there was nothing in the world they liked better than these snatched felicities little parties long talks with i ll come to you to morrow and no i ll come to you make believe renewals of their old life they were fairly at times the dear things like children playing at paying visits playing at mr thompson and mrs fane each hoping that the other would really stay to tea charlotte was sure she should find maggie there on getting home a remark in which mrs verver s immediate response to her friend s inquiry had culminated she had thus on the spot the sense of having given her plenty to think about and that moreover of liking to see it even better than she had expected she had plenty to think about herself and there was already something in fanny that made it seem still more you say your husband s ill he felt too ill to come no my dear i think not if he had been too ill i wouldn t have left him and yet maggie was worried mrs assingham asked she worries you know easily she s afraid of influenza of which he has had at different times though never with the least gravity several attacks but you re not afraid of it charlotte had for a moment a pause it had continued to come to her that really to have her case out as they said with the person in the world to whom her most intimate difficulties had oftenest referred themselves would help her on the whole more than hinder and under that feeling all her opportunity with nothing kept back with a thing or two perhaps even thrust forward seemed temptingly to open besides didn t fanny at bottom half expect absolutely at the bottom half want things so that she would be disappointed if after what must just have occurred for her she didn t get something to put between the teeth of her so restless rumination that cultivation of the fear of which our young woman had already had glimpses that she might have gone too far in her irrepressible interest in other lives what had just happened it pieced itself together for charlotte was that the assingham pair drifting like everyone else had had somewhere in the gallery in the rooms an accidental concussion had it after the colonel over his balustrade had observed in the favouring high light her public junction with the prince his very dryness in this encounter had as always struck a spark from his wife s curiosity and familiar on his side with all that she saw in things he had thrown her as a fine little bone to pick some report of the way one of her young friends was going on with another he knew perfectly such at least was charlotte s liberal assumption that she wasn t going on with anyone but she also knew that given the circumstances she was inevitably to be sacrificed in some form or another to the humorous intercourse of the inimitable couple the prince meanwhile had also under coercion sacrificed her the ambassador had come up to him with a message from royalty to whom he was led away after which she had talked for five minutes with sir john brinder who had been of the ambassador s company and who had rather artlessly remained with her fanny had then arrived in sight of them at the same moment as someone else she didn t know someone who knew mrs assingham and also knew sir john charlotte had left it to her friend s competence to throw the two others immediately together and to find a way for entertaining her in closer quarters this was the little history of the vision in her that was now rapidly helping her to recognise a precious chance the chance that mightn t again soon be so good for the vivid making of a point her point was before her it was sharp bright true above all it was her own she had reached it quite by herself no one not even amerigo amerigo least of all who would have nothing to do with it had given her aid to make it now with force for fanny assingham s benefit would see her further in the direction in which the light had dawned than any other spring she should yet awhile doubtless be able to press the direction was that of her greater freedom which was all in the world she had in mind her opportunity had accordingly after a few minutes of mrs assingham s almost imprudently interested expression of face positively acquired such a price for her that she may for ourselves while the intensity lasted rather resemble a person holding out a small mirror at arm s length and consulting it with a special turn of the head it was in a word with this value of her chance that she was intelligently playing when she said in answer to fanny s last question don t you remember what you told me on the occasion of something or other the other day that you believe there s nothing i m afraid of so my dear don t ask me mayn t i ask you mrs assingham returned how the case stands with your poor husband certainly dear only when you ask me as if i mightn t perhaps know what to think it seems to me best to let you see that i know perfectly what to think mrs assingham hesitated then blinking a little she took her risk you didn t think that if it was a question of anyone s returning to him in his trouble it would be better you yourself should have gone well charlotte s answer to this inquiry visibly shaped itself in the interest of the highest considerations the highest considerations were good humour candour clearness and obviously the real truth if we couldn t be perfectly frank and dear with each other it would be ever so much better wouldn t it that we shouldn t talk about anything at all which however would be dreadful and we certainly at any rate haven t yet come to it you can ask me anything under the sun you like because don t you see you can t upset me i m sure my dear charlotte fanny assingham laughed i don t want to upset you indeed love you simply couldn t even if you thought it necessary that s all i mean nobody could for it belongs to my situation that i m by no merit of my own just fixed fixed as fast as a pin stuck up to its head in a cushion i m placed i can t imagine anyone more placed there i am fanny had indeed never listened to emphasis more firmly applied and it brought into her own eyes though she had reasons for striving to keep them from betrayals a sort of anxiety of intelligence i dare say but your statement of your position however you see it isn t an answer to my inquiry it seems to me at the same time i confess mrs assingham added to give but the more reason for it you speak of our being frank how can we possibly be anything else if maggie has gone off through finding herself too distressed to stay and if she s willing to leave you and her husband to show here without her aren t the grounds of her preoccupation more or less discussable if they re not charlotte replied it s only from their being in a way too evident they re not grounds for me they weren t when i accepted adam s preference that i should come to night without him just as i accept absolutely as a fixed rule all his preferences but that doesn t alter the fact of course that my husband s daughter rather than his wife should have felt she could after all be the one to stay with him the one to make the sacrifice of this hour seeing especially that the daughter has a husband of her own in the field with which she produced as it were her explanation i ve simply to see the truth of the matter see that maggie thinks more on the whole of fathers than of husbands and my situation is such she went on that this becomes immediately don t you understand a thing i have to count with mrs assingham vaguely heaving panting a little but trying not to show it turned about from some inward spring in her seat if you mean such a thing as that she doesn t adore the prince i don t say she doesn t adore him what i say is that she doesn t think of him one of those conditions doesn t always at all stages involve the other this is just how she adores him charlotte said and what reason is there in the world after all why he and i shouldn t as you say show together we ve shown together my dear she smiled before her friend for a little only looked at her speaking then with abruptness you ought to be absolutely happy you live with such good people the effect of it as well was an arrest for charlotte whose face however all of whose fine and slightly hard radiance it had caused the next instant further to brighten does one ever put into words anything so fatuously rash it s a thing that must be said in prudence for one by somebody who s so good as to take the responsibility the more that it gives one always a chance to show one s best manners by not contradicting it certainly you ll never have the distress or whatever of hearing me complain truly my dear i hope in all conscience not and the elder woman s spirit found relief in a laugh more resonant than was quite advised by their pursuit of privacy to this demonstration her friend gave no heed with all our absence after marriage and with the separation from her produced in particular by our so many months in america maggie has still arrears still losses to make up still the need of showing how for so long she simply kept missing him she missed his company a large allowance of which is in spite of everything else of the first necessity to her so she puts it in when she can a little here a little there and it ends by making up a considerable amount the fact of our distinct establishments which has all the same everything in its favour charlotte hastened to declare makes her really see more of him than when they had the same house to make sure she doesn t fail of it she s always arranging for it which she didn t have to do while they lived together but she likes to arrange charlotte steadily proceeded it peculiarly suits her and the result of our separate households is really for them more contact and more intimacy to night for instance has been practically an arrangement she likes him best alone and it s the way said our young woman in which he best likes her it s what i mean therefore by being placed and the great thing is as they say to know one s place doesn t it all strike you she wound up as rather placing the prince too fanny assingham had at this moment the sense as of a large heaped dish presented to her intelligence and inviting it to a feast so thick were the notes of intention in this remarkable speech but she also felt that to plunge at random to help herself too freely would apart from there not being at such a moment time for it tend to jostle the ministering hand confound the array and more vulgarly speaking make a mess so she picked out after consideration a solitary plum so placed that you have to arrange certainly i have to arrange and the prince also if the effect for him is the same really i think not less and does he arrange mrs assingham asked to make up his arrears the question had risen to her lips it was as if another morsel on the dish had tempted her the sound of it struck her own ear immediately as giving out more of her thought than she had as yet intended but she quickly saw that she must follow it up at any risk with simplicity and that what was simplest was the ease of boldness make them up i mean by coming to see you charlotte replied however without as her friend would have phrased it turning a hair she shook her head but it was beautifully gentle he never comes oh said fanny assingham with which she felt a little stupid there it is he might so well you know otherwise otherwise and fanny was still vague it passed this time over her companion whose eyes wandering to a distance found themselves held the prince was at hand again the ambassador was still at his side they were stopped a moment by a uniformed personage a little old man of apparently the highest military character bristling with medals and orders this gave charlotte time to go on he has not been for three months and then as with her friend s last word in her ear otherwise yes he arranges otherwise and in my position she added i might too it s too absurd we shouldn t meet you ve met i gather said fanny assingham to night yes as far as that goes but what i mean is that i might placed for it as we both are go to see him and do you fanny asked with almost mistaken solemnity the perception of this excess made charlotte whether for gravity or for irony hang fire a minute i have been but that s nothing she said in itself and i tell you of it only to show you how our situation works it essentially becomes one a situation for both of us the prince s however is his own affair i meant but to speak of mine your situation s perfect mrs assingham presently declared i don t say it isn t taken in fact all round i think it is and i don t as i tell you complain of it the only thing is that i have to act as it demands of me to act said mrs assingham with an irrepressible quaver isn t it acting my dear to accept it i do accept it what do you want me to do less i want you to believe that you re a very fortunate person do you call that less charlotte asked with a smile from the point of view of my freedom i call it more let it take my position any name you like don t let it at any rate and mrs assingham s impatience prevailed at last over her presence of mind don t let it make you think too much of your freedom i don t know what you call too much for how can i not see it as it is you d see your own quickly enough if the colonel gave you the same liberty and i haven t to tell you with your so much greater knowledge of everything what it is that gives such liberty most for yourself personally of course charlotte went on you only know the state of neither needing it nor missing it your husband doesn t treat you as of less importance to him than some other woman ah don t talk to me of other women fanny now overtly panted do you call mr verver s perfectly natural interest in his daughter the greatest affection of which he is capable charlotte took it up in all readiness i do distinctly and in spite of my having done all i could think of to make him capable of a greater i ve done earnestly everything i could i ve made it month after month my study but i haven t succeeded it has been vividly brought home to me to night however she pursued i ve hoped against hope for i recognise that as i told you at the time i was duly warned and then as she met in her friend s face the absence of any such remembrance he did tell me that he wanted me just because i could be useful about her with which charlotte broke into a wonderful smile so you see i am it was on fanny assingham s lips for the moment to reply that this was on the contrary exactly what she didn t see she came in fact within an ace of saying you strike me as having quite failed to help his idea to work since by your account maggie has him not less but so much more on her mind how in the world with so much of a remedy comes there to remain so much of what was to be obviated but she saved herself in time conscious above all that she was in presence of still deeper things than she had yet dared to fear that there was more in it than any admission she had made represented and she had held herself familiar with admissions so that not to seem to understand where she couldn t accept and not to seem to accept where she couldn t approve and could still less with precipitation advise she invoked the mere appearance of casting no weight whatever into the scales of her young friend s consistency the only thing was that as she was quickly enough to feel she invoked it rather to excess it brought her her invocation too abruptly to her feet she brushed away everything i can t conceive my dear what you re talking about charlotte promptly rose then as might be to meet it and her colour for the first time perceptibly heightened she looked for the minute as her companion had looked as if twenty protests blocking each other s way had surged up within her but when charlotte had to make a selection her selection was always the most effective possible it was happy now above all for being made not in anger but in sorrow you give me up then give you up you forsake me at the hour of my life when it seems to me i most deserve a friend s loyalty if you do you re not just fanny you re even i think she went on rather cruel and it s least of all worthy of you to seem to wish to quarrel with me in order to cover your desertion she spoke at the same time with the noblest moderation of tone and the image of high pale lighted disappointment she meanwhile presented as of a creature patient and lonely in her splendour was an impression so firmly imposed that she could fill her measure to the brim and yet enjoy the last word as it is called in such cases with a perfection void of any vulgarity of triumph she merely completed for truth s sake her demonstration what is a quarrel with me but a quarrel with my right to recognise the conditions of my bargain but i can carry them out alone she said as she turned away she turned to meet the ambassador and the prince who their colloquy with their field marshal ended were now at hand and had already between them she was aware addressed her a remark that failed to penetrate the golden glow in which her intelligence was temporarily bathed she had made her point the point she had foreseen she must make she had made it thoroughly and once for all so that no more making was required and her success was reflected in the faces of the two men of distinction before her unmistakably moved to admiration by her exceptional radiance she at first but watched this reflection taking no note of any less adequate form of it possibly presented by poor fanny poor fanny left to stare at her incurred score chalked up in so few strokes on the wall then she took in what the ambassador was saying in french what he was apparently repeating to her a desire for your presence madame has been expressed en tres haut lieu and i ve let myself in for the responsibility to say nothing of the honour of seeing as the most respectful of your friends that so august an impatience is not kept waiting the greatest possible personage had in short according to the odd formula of societies subject to the greatest personages possible sent for her and she asked in her surprise what in the world does he want to do to me only to know without looking that fanny s bewilderment was called to a still larger application and to hear the prince say with authority indeed with a certain prompt dryness you must go immediately it s a summons the ambassador using authority as well had already somehow possessed himself of her hand which he drew into his arm and she was further conscious as she went off with him that though still speaking for her benefit amerigo had turned to fanny assingham he would explain afterwards besides which she would understand for herself to fanny however he had laughed as a mark apparently that for this infallible friend no explanation at all would be necessary xv it may be recorded none the less that the prince was the next moment to see how little any such assumption was founded alone with him now mrs assingham was incorruptible they send for charlotte through you no my dear as you see through the ambassador ah but the ambassador and you for the last quarter of an hour have been for them as one he s your ambassador it may indeed be further mentioned that the more fanny looked at it the more she saw in it they ve connected her with you she s treated as your appendage oh my appendage the prince amusedly exclaimed cara mia what a name she s treated rather say as my ornament and my glory and it s so remarkable a case for a mother in law that you surely can t find fault with it you ve ornaments enough it seems to me as you ve certainly glories enough without her and she s not the least little bit mrs assingham observed your mother in law in such a matter a shade of difference is enormous she s no relation to you whatever and if she s known in high quarters but as going about with you then then she failed however as from positive intensity of vision then then what he asked with perfect good nature she had better in such a case not be known at all but i assure you i never just now so much as mentioned her do you suppose i asked them said the young man still amused if they didn t want to see her you surely don t need to be shown that charlotte speaks for herself that she does so above all on such an occasion as this and looking as she does to night how so looking can she pass unnoticed how can she not have success besides he added as she but watched his face letting him say what he would as if she wanted to see how he would say it besides there is always the fact that we re of the same connection of what is your word the same concern we re certainly not with the relation of our respective sposi simply formal acquaintances we re in the same boat and the prince smiled with a candour that added an accent to his emphasis fanny assingham was full of the special sense of his manner it caused her to turn for a moment s refuge to a corner of her general consciousness in which she could say to herself that she was glad she wasn t in love with such a man as with charlotte just before she was embarrassed by the difference between what she took in and what she could say what she felt and what she could show it only appears to me of great importance that now that you all seem more settled here charlotte should be known for any presentation any further circulation or introduction as in particular her husband s wife known in the least possible degree as anything else i don t know what you mean by the same boat charlotte is naturally in mr verver s boat and pray am i not in mr verver s boat too why but for mr verver s boat i should have been by this time and his quick italian gesture an expressive direction and motion of his forefinger pointed to deepest depths away down down down she knew of course what he meant how it had taken his father in law s great fortune and taken no small slice to surround him with an element in which all too fatally weighted as he had originally been he could pecuniarily float and with this reminder other things came to her how strange it was that with all allowance for their merit it should befall some people to be so inordinately valued quoted as they said in the stock market so high and how still stranger perhaps that there should be cases in which for some reason one didn t mind the so frequently marked absence in them of the purpose really to represent their price she was thinking feeling at any rate for herself she was thinking that the pleasure she could take in this specimen of the class didn t suffer from his consent to be merely made buoyant partly because it was one of those pleasures he inspired them that by their nature couldn t suffer to whatever proof they were put and partly because besides he after all visibly had on his conscience some sort of return for services rendered he was a huge expense assuredly but it had been up to now her conviction that his idea was to behave beautifully enough to make the beauty well nigh an equivalent and that he had carried out his idea carried it out by continuing to lead the life to breathe the air very nearly to think the thoughts that best suited his wife and her father this she had till lately enjoyed the comfort of so distinctly perceiving as to have even been moved more than once to express to him the happiness it gave her he had that in his favour as against other matters yet it discouraged her too and rather oddly that he should so keep moving and be able to show her that he moved on the firm ground of the truth his acknowledgment of obligation was far from unimportant but she could find in his grasp of the real itself a kind of ominous intimation the intimation appeared to peep at her even out of his next word lightly as he produced it isn t it rather as if we had charlotte and i for bringing us together a benefactor in common and the effect for his interlocutress was still further to be deepened i somehow feel half the time as if he were her father in law too it s as if he had saved us both which is a fact in our lives or at any rate in our hearts to make of itself a link don t you remember he kept it up how the day she suddenly turned up for you just before my wedding we so frankly and funnily talked in her presence of the advisability for her of some good marriage and then as his friend s face in her extremity quite again as with charlotte but continued to fly the black flag of general repudiation well we really began then as it seems to me the work of placing her where she is we were wholly right and so was she that it was exactly the thing is shown by its success we recommended a good marriage at almost any price so to speak and taking us at our word she has made the very best that was really what we meant wasn t it only what she has got something thoroughly good it would be difficult it seems to me for her to have anything better once you allow her the way it s to be taken of course if you don t allow her that the case is different her offset is a certain decent freedom which i judge she ll be quite contented with you may say that will be very good of her but she strikes me as perfectly humble about it she proposes neither to claim it nor to use it with any sort of retentissement she would enjoy it i think quite as quietly as it might be given the boat you see the prince explained it no less considerately and lucidly is a good deal tied up at the dock or anchored if you like out in the stream i have to jump out from time to time to stretch my legs and you ll probably perceive if you give it your attention that charlotte really can t help occasionally doing the same it isn t even a question sometimes of one s getting to the dock one has to take a header and splash about in the water call our having remained here together to night call the accident of my having put them put our illustrious friends there on my companion s track for i grant you this as a practical result of our combination call the whole thing one of the harmless little plunges off the deck inevitable for each of us why not take them when they occur as inevitable and above all as not endangering life or limb we shan t drown we shan t sink at least i can answer for myself mrs verver too moreover do her the justice visibly knows how to swim he could easily go on for she didn t interrupt him fanny felt now that she wouldn t have interrupted him for the world she found his eloquence precious there was not a drop of it that she didn t in a manner catch as it came for immediate bottling for future preservation the crystal flask of her innermost attention really received it on the spot and she had even already the vision of how in the snug laboratory of her afterthought she should be able chemically to analyse it there were moments positively still beyond this when with the meeting of their eyes something as yet unnamable came out for her in his look when something strange and subtle and at variance with his words something that gave them away glimmered deep down as an appeal almost an incredible one to her finer comprehension what inconceivably was it like wasn t it however gross such a rendering of anything so occult fairly like a quintessential wink a hint of the possibility of their really treating their subject of course on some better occasion and thereby as well finding it much more interesting if this far red spark which might have been figured by her mind as the head light of an approaching train seen through the length of a tunnel was not on her side an ignis fatuus a mere subjective phenomenon it twinkled there at the direct expense of what the prince was inviting her to understand meanwhile too however and unmistakably the real treatment of their subject did at a given moment sound this was when he proceeded with just the same perfect possession of his thought on the manner of which he couldn t have improved to complete his successful simile by another in fact by just the supreme touch the touch for which it had till now been waiting for mrs verver to be known to people so intensely and exclusively as her husband s wife something is wanted that you know they haven t exactly got he should manage to be known or at least to be seen a little more as his wife s husband you surely must by this time have seen for yourself that he has his own habits and his own ways and that he makes more and more as of course he has a perfect right to do his own discriminations he s so perfect so ideal a father and doubtless largely by that very fact a generous a comfortable an admirable father in law that i should really feel it base to avail myself of any standpoint whatever to criticise him to you nevertheless i may make just one remark for you re not stupid you always understand so blessedly what one means he paused an instant as if even this one remark might be difficult for him should she give no sign of encouraging him to produce it nothing would have induced her however to encourage him she was now conscious of having never in her life stood so still or sat inwardly as it were so tight she felt like the horse of the adage brought and brought by her own fault to the water but strong for the occasion in the one fact that she couldn t be forced to drink invited in other words to understand she held her breath for fear of showing she did and this for the excellent reason that she was at last fairly afraid to it was sharp for her at the same time that she was certain in advance of his remark that she heard it before it had sounded that she already tasted in fine the bitterness it would have for her special sensibility but her companion from an inward and different need of his own was presently not deterred by her silence what i really don t see is why from his own point of view given that is his conditions so fortunate as they stood he should have wished to marry at all there it was then exactly what she knew would come and exactly for reasons that seemed now to thump at her heart as distressing to her yet she was resolved meanwhile not to suffer as they used to say of the martyrs then and there not to suffer odiously helplessly in public which could be prevented but by her breaking off with whatever inconsequence by her treating their discussion as ended and getting away she suddenly wanted to go home much as she had wanted an hour or two before to come she wanted to leave well behind her both her question and the couple in whom it had abruptly taken such vivid form but it was dreadful to have the appearance of disconcerted flight discussion had of itself to her sense become danger such light as from open crevices it let in and the overt recognition of danger was worse than anything else the worst in fact came while she was thinking how she could retreat and still not overtly recognise her face had betrayed her trouble and with that she was lost i m afraid however the prince said that i for some reason distress you for which i beg your pardon we ve always talked so well together it has been from the beginning the greatest pull for me nothing so much as such a tone could have quickened her collapse she felt he had her now at his mercy and he showed as he went on that he knew it we shall talk again all the same better than ever i depend on it too much don t you remember what i told you so definitely one day before my marriage that moving as i did in so many ways among new things mysteries conditions expectations assumptions different from any i had known i looked to you as my original sponsor my fairy godmother to see me through i beg you to believe he added that i look to you yet his very insistence had fortunately the next moment affected her as bringing her help with which at least she could hold up her head to speak ah you are through you were through long ago or if you aren t you ought to be well then if i ought to be it s all the more reason why you should continue to help me because very distinctly i assure you i m not the new things or ever so many of them are still for me new things the mysteries and expectations and assumptions still contain an immense element that i ve failed to puzzle out as we ve happened so luckily to find ourselves again really taking hold together you must let me as soon as possible come to see you you must give me a good kind hour if you refuse it me and he addressed himself to her continued reserve i shall feel that you deny with a stony stare your responsibility at this as from a sudden shake her reserve proved an inadequate vessel she could bear her own her private reference to the weight on her mind but the touch of another hand made it too horribly press oh i deny responsibility to you so far as i ever had it i ve done with it he had been all the while beautifully smiling but she made his look now penetrate her again more as to whom then do you confess it ah mio caro that s if to anyone my own business he continued to look at her hard you give me up then it was what charlotte had asked her ten minutes before and its coming from him so much in the same way shook her in her place she was on the point of replying do you and she agree together for what you ll say to me but she was glad afterwards to have checked herself in time little as her actual answer had perhaps bettered it i think i don t know what to make of you you must receive me at least he said oh please not till i m ready for you and though she found a laugh for it she had to turn away she had never turned away from him before and it was quite positively for her as if she were altogether afraid of him xvi later on when their hired brougham had with the long vociferation that tormented her impatience been extricated from the endless rank she rolled into the london night beside her husband as into a sheltering darkness where she could muffle herself and draw breath she had stood for the previous half hour in a merciless glare beaten upon stared out of countenance it fairly seemed to her by intimations of her mistake for what she was most immediately feeling was that she had in the past been active for these people to ends that were now bearing fruit and that might yet bear a larger crop she but brooded at first in her corner of the carriage it was like burying her exposed face a face too helplessly exposed in the cool lap of the common indifference of the dispeopled streets of the closed shops and darkened houses seen through the window of the brougham a world mercifully unconscious and unreproachful it wouldn t like the world she had just left know sooner or later what she had done or would know it at least only if the final consequence should be some quite overwhelming publicity she fixed this possibility itself so hard however for a few moments that the misery of her fear produced the next minute a reaction and when the carriage happened while it grazed a turn to catch the straight shaft from the lamp of a policeman in the act of playing his inquisitive flash over an opposite house front she let herself wince at being thus incriminated only that she might protest not less quickly against mere blind terror it had become for the occasion preposterously terror of which she must shake herself free before she could properly measure her ground the perception of this necessity had in truth soon aided her since she found on trying that lurid as her prospect might hover there she could none the less give it no name the sense of seeing was strong in her but she clutched at the comfort of not being sure of what she saw not to know what it would represent on a longer view was a help in turn to not making out that her hands were embrued since if she had stood in the position of a producing cause she should surely be less vague about what she had produced this further in its way was a step toward reflecting that when one s connection with any matter was too indirect to be traced it might be described also as too slight to be deplored by the time they were nearing cadogan place she had in fact recognised that she couldn t be as curious as she desired without arriving at some conviction of her being as innocent but there had been a moment in the dim desert of eaton square when she broke into speech it s only their defending themselves so much more than they need it s only that that makes me wonder it s their having so remarkably much to say for themselves her husband had as usual lighted his cigar remaining apparently as busy with it as she with her agitation you mean it makes you feel that you have nothing to which as she made no answer the colonel added what in the world did you ever suppose was going to happen the man s in a position in which he has nothing in life to do her silence seemed to characterise this statement as superficial and her thoughts as always in her husband s company pursued an independent course he made her when they were together talk but as if for some other person who was in fact for the most part herself yet she addressed herself with him as she could never have done without him he has behaved beautifully he did from the first i ve thought it all along wonderful of him and i ve more than once when i ve had a chance told him so therefore therefore but it died away as she mused therefore he has a right for a change to kick up his heels it isn t a question of course however she undivertedly went on of their behaving beautifully apart it s a question of their doing as they should when together which is another matter and how do you think then the colonel asked with interest that when together they should do the less they do one would say the better if you see so much in it his wife at this appeared to hear him i don t see in it what you d see and don t my dear she further answered think it necessary to be horrid or low about them they re the last people really to make anything of that sort come in right i m surely never horrid or low he returned about anyone but my extravagant wife i can do with all our friends as i see them myself what i can t do with is the figures you make of them and when you take to adding your figures up but he exhaled it again in smoke my additions don t matter when you ve not to pay the bill with which her meditation again bore her through the air the great thing was that when it so suddenly came up for her he wasn t afraid if he had been afraid he could perfectly have prevented it and if i had seen he was if i hadn t seen he wasn t so said mrs assingham could i so she declared would i it s perfectly true she went on it was too good a thing for her such a chance in life not to be accepted and i liked his not keeping her out of it merely from a fear of his own nature it was so wonderful it should come to her the only thing would have been if charlotte herself couldn t have faced it then if she had not had confidence we might have talked but she had it to any amount did you ask her how much bob assingham patiently inquired he had put the question with no more than his usual modest hope of reward but he had pressed this time the sharpest spring of response never never it wasn t a time to ask asking is suggesting and it wasn t a time to suggest one had to make up one s mind as quietly as possible by what one could judge and i judge as i say that charlotte felt she could face it for which she struck me at the time as for so proud a creature almost touchingly grateful the thing i should never forgive her for would be her forgetting to whom it is her thanks have remained most due that is to mrs assingham she said nothing for a little there were after all alternatives maggie herself of course astonishing little maggie is maggie then astonishing too and he gloomed out of his window his wife on her side now as they rolled projected the same look i m not sure that i don t begin to see more in her than dear little person as i ve always thought i ever supposed there was i m not sure that putting a good many things together i m not beginning to make her out rather extraordinary you certainly will if you can the colonel resignedly remarked again his companion said nothing then again she broke out in fact i do begin to feel it maggie s the great comfort i m getting hold of it it will be she who ll see us through in fact she ll have to and she ll be able touch by touch her meditation had completed it but with a cumulative effect for her husband s general sense of her method that caused him to overflow whimsically enough in his corner into an ejaculation now frequent on his lips for the relief that especially in communion like the present it gave him and that fanny had critically traced to the quaint example the aboriginal homeliness still so delightful of mr verver oh lordy lordy if she is however mrs assingham continued she ll be extraordinary enough and that s what i m thinking of but i m not indeed so very sure she added of the person to whom charlotte ought in decency to be most grateful i mean i m not sure if that person is even almost the incredible little idealist who has made her his wife i shouldn t think you would be love the colonel with some promptness responded charlotte as the wife of an incredible little idealist his cigar in short once more could alone express it yet what is that when one thinks but just what she struck one as more or less persuaded that she herself was really going to be this memory for the full view fanny found herself also invoking it made her companion in truth slightly gape an incredible little idealist charlotte herself and she was sincere his wife simply proceeded she was unmistakably sincere the question is only how much is left of it and that i see happens to be another of the questions you can t ask her you have to do it all said bob assingham as if you were playing some game with its rules drawn up though who s to come down on you if you break them i don t quite see or must you do it in three guesses like forfeits on christmas eve to which as his ribaldry but dropped from her he further added how much of anything will have to be left for you to be able to go on with it i shall go on fanny assingham a trifle grimly declared while there s a scrap as big as your nail but we re not yet luckily reduced only to that she had another pause holding the while the thread of that larger perception into which her view of mrs verver s obligation to maggie had suddenly expanded even if her debt was not to the others even then it ought to be quite sufficiently to the prince himself to keep her straight for what really did the prince do she asked herself but generously trust her what did he do but take it from her that if she felt herself willing it was because she felt herself strong that creates for her upon my word mrs assingham pursued a duty of considering him of honourably repaying his trust which well which she ll be really a fiend if she doesn t make the law of her conduct i mean of course his trust that she wouldn t interfere with him expressed by his holding himself quiet at the critical time the brougham was nearing home and it was perhaps this sense of ebbing opportunity that caused the colonel s next meditation to flower in a fashion almost surprising to his wife they were united for the most part but by his exhausted patience so that indulgent despair was generally at the best his note he at present however actually compromised with his despair to the extent of practically admitting that he had followed her steps he literally asked in short an intelligent well nigh a sympathising question gratitude to the prince for not having put a spoke in her wheel that you mean should taking it in the right way be precisely the ballast of her boat taking it in the right way fanny catching at this gleam emphasised the proviso but doesn t it rather depend on what she may most feel to be the right way no it depends on nothing because there s only one way for duty or delicacy oh delicacy bob assingham rather crudely murmured i mean the highest kind moral charlotte s perfectly capable of appreciating that by every dictate of moral delicacy she must let him alone then you ve made up your mind it s all poor charlotte he asked with an effect of abruptness the effect whether intended or not reached her brought her face short round it was a touch at which she again lost her balance at which somehow the bottom dropped out of her recovered comfort then you ve made up yours differently it really struck you that there is something the movement itself apparently made him once more stand off he had felt on his nearer approach the high temperature of the question perhaps that s just what she s doing showing him how much she s letting him alone pointing it out to him from day to day did she point it out by waiting for him to night on the stair case in the manner you described to me i really my dear described to you a manner the colonel clearly from want of habit scarce recognised himself in the imputation yes for once in a way in those few words we had after you had watched them come up you told me something of what you had seen you didn t tell me very much that you couldn t for your life but i saw for myself that strange to say you had received your impression and i felt therefore that there must indeed have been something out of the way for you so to betray it she was fully upon him now and she confronted him with his proved sensibility to the occasion confronted him because of her own uneasy need to profit by it it came over her still more than at the time it came over her that he had been struck with something even he poor dear man and that for this to have occurred there must have been much to be struck with she tried in fact to corner him to pack him insistently down in the truth of his plain vision the very plainness of which was its value for so recorded she felt none of it would escape she should have it at hand for reference come my dear you thought what you thought in the presence of what you saw you couldn t resist thinking i don t ask more of it than that and your idea is worth this time quite as much as any of mine so that you can t pretend as usual that mine has run away with me i haven t caught up with you i stay where i am but i see she concluded where you are and i m much obliged to you for letting me you give me a point de repere outside myself which is where i like it now i can work round you their conveyance as she spoke stopped at their door and it was on the spot another fact of value for her that her husband though seated on the side by which they must alight made no movement they were in a high degree votaries of the latch key so that their household had gone to bed and as they were unaccompanied by a footman the coachman waited in peace it was so indeed that for a minute bob assingham waited conscious of a reason for replying to this address otherwise than by the so obvious method of turning his back he didn t turn his face but he stared straight before him and his wife had already perceived in the fact of his not moving all the proof she could desire proof that is of her own contention she knew he never cared what she said and his neglect of his chance to show it was thereby the more eloquent leave it he at last remarked to them leave it she wondered let them alone they ll manage they ll manage you mean to do everything they want ah there then you are they ll manage in their own way the colonel almost cryptically repeated it had its effect for her quite apart from its light on the familiar phenomenon of her husband s indurated conscience it gave her full in her face the particular evocation of which she had made him guilty it was wonderful truly then the evocation so cleverly that s your idea that no one will be the wiser it s your idea that we shall have done all that s required of us if we simply protect them the colonel still in his place declined however to be drawn into a statement of his idea statements were too much like theories in which one lost one s way he only knew what he said and what he said represented the limited vibration of which his confirmed old toughness had been capable still none the less he had his point to make for which he took another instant but he made it for the third time in the same fashion they ll manage in their own way with which he got out oh yes at this for his companion it had indeed its effect and while he mounted their steps she but stared without following him at his opening of their door their hall was lighted and as he stood in the aperture looking back at her his tall lean figure outlined in darkness and with his crush hat according to his wont worn cavalierly rather diabolically askew he seemed to prolong the sinister emphasis of his meaning in general on these returns he came back for her when he had prepared their entrance so that it was now as if he were ashamed to face her in closer quarters he looked at her across the interval and still in her seat weighing his charge she felt her whole view of everything flare up wasn t it simply what had been written in the prince s own face beneath what he was saying didn t it correspond with the mocking presence there that she had had her troubled glimpse of wasn t in fine the pledge that they would manage in their own way the thing he had been feeling for his chance to invite her to take from him her husband s tone somehow fitted amerigo s look the one that had for her so strangely peeped from behind over the shoulder of the one in front she had not then read it but wasn t she reading it when she now saw in it his surmise that she was perhaps to be squared she wasn t to be squared and while she heard her companion call across to her well what s the matter she also took time to remind herself that she had decided she couldn t be frightened the matter why it was sufficiently the matter with all this that she felt a little sick for it was not the prince that she had been prepared to regard as primarily the shaky one shakiness in charlotte she had at the most perhaps postulated it would be she somehow felt more easy to deal with therefore if he had come so far it was a different pair of sleeves there was nothing to choose between them it made her so helpless that as the time passed without her alighting the colonel came back and fairly drew her forth after which on the pavement under the street lamp their very silence might have been the mark of something grave their silence eked out for her by his giving her his arm and their then crawling up their steps quite mildly and unitedly together like some old darby and joan who have had a disappointment it almost resembled a return from a funeral unless indeed it resembled more the hushed approach to a house of mourning what indeed had she come home for but to bury as decently as possible her mistake xvii it appeared thus that they might enjoy together extraordinary freedom the two friends from the moment they should understand their position aright with the prince himself from an early stage not unnaturally charlotte had made a great point of their so understanding it she had found frequent occasion to describe to him this necessity and her resignation tempered or her intelligence at least quickened by irrepressible irony she applied at different times different names to the propriety of their case the wonderful thing was that her sense of propriety had been from the first especially alive about it there were hours when she spoke of their taking refuge in what she called the commonest tact as if this principle alone would suffice to light their way there were others when it might have seemed to listen to her that their course would demand of them the most anxious study and the most independent not to say original interpretation of signs she talked now as if it were indicated at every turn by finger posts of almost ridiculous prominence she talked again as if it lurked in devious ways and were to be tracked through bush and briar and she even on occasion delivered herself in the sense that as their situation was unprecedented so their heaven was without stars do she once had echoed to him as the upshot of passages covertly though briefly occurring between them on her return from the visit to america that had immediately succeeded her marriage determined for her by this event as promptly as an excursion of the like strange order had been prescribed in his own case isn t the immense the really quite matchless beauty of our position that we have to do nothing in life at all nothing except the usual necessary everyday thing which consists in one s not being more of a fool than one can help that s all but that s as true for one time as for another there has been plenty of doing and there will doubtless be plenty still but it s all theirs every inch of it it s all a matter of what they ve done to us and she showed how the question had therefore been only of their taking everything as everything came and all as quietly as might be nothing stranger surely had ever happened to a conscientious a well meaning a perfectly passive pair no more extraordinary decree had ever been launched against such victims than this of forcing them against their will into a relation of mutual close contact that they had done everything to avoid she was to remember not a little meanwhile the particular prolonged silent look with which the prince had met her allusion to these primary efforts at escape she was inwardly to dwell on the element of the unuttered that her tone had caused to play up into his irresistible eyes and this because she considered with pride and joy that she had on the spot disposed of the doubt the question the challenge or whatever else might have been that such a look could convey he had been sufficiently off his guard to show some little wonder as to their having plotted so very hard against their destiny and she knew well enough of course what in this connection was at the bottom of his thought and what would have sounded out more or less if he had not happily saved himself from words all men were brutes enough to catch when they might at such chances for dissent for all the good it really did them but the prince s distinction was in being one of the few who could check himself before acting on the impulse this obviously was what counted in a man as delicacy if her friend had blurted or bungled he would have said in his simplicity did we do everything to avoid it when we faced your remarkable marriage quite handsomely of course using the plural taking his share of the case by way of a tribute of memory to the telegram she had received from him in paris after mr verver had despatched to rome the news of their engagement that telegram that acceptance of the prospect proposed to them an acceptance quite other than perfunctory she had never destroyed though reserved for no eyes but her own it was still carefully reserved she kept it in a safe place from which very privately she sometimes took it out to read it over a la guerre comme a la guerre then it had been couched in the french tongue we must lead our lives as we see them but i am charmed with your courage and almost surprised at my own the message had remained ambiguous she had read it in more lights than one it might mean that even without her his career was up hill work for him a daily fighting matter on behalf of a good appearance and that thus if they were to become neighbours again the event would compel him to live still more under arms it might mean on the other hand that he found he was happy enough and that accordingly so far as she might imagine herself a danger she was to think of him as prepared in advance as really seasoned and secure on his arrival in paris with his wife none the less she had asked for no explanation just as he himself had not asked if the document were still in her possession such an inquiry everything implied was beneath him just as it was beneath herself to mention to him uninvited that she had instantly offered and in perfect honesty to show the telegram to mr verver and that if this companion had but said the word she would immediately have put it before him she had thereby forborne to call his attention to her consciousness that such an exposure would in all probability straightway have dished her marriage that all her future had in fact for the moment hung by the single hair of mr verver s delicacy as she supposed they must call it and that her position in the matter of responsibility was therefore inattackably straight for the prince himself meanwhile time in its measured allowance had originally much helped him helped him in the sense of there not being enough of it to trip him up in spite of which it was just this accessory element that seemed at present with wonders of patience to lie in wait time had begotten at first more than anything else separations delays and intervals but it was troublesomely less of an aid from the moment it began so to abound that he had to meet the question of what to do with it less of it was required for the state of being married than he had on the whole expected less strangely for the state of being married even as he was married and there was a logic in the matter he knew a logic that but gave this truth a sort of solidity of evidence mr verver decidedly helped him with it with his wedded condition helped him really so much that it made all the difference in the degree in which he rendered it the service on mr verver s part was remarkable as indeed what service from the first of their meeting had not been he was living he had been living these four or five years on mr verver s services a truth scarcely less plain if he dealt with them for appreciation one by one than if he poured them all together into the general pot of his gratitude and let the thing simmer to a nourishing broth to the latter way with them he was undoubtedly most disposed yet he would even thus on occasion pick out a piece to taste on its own merits wondrous at such hours could seem the savour of the particular treat at his father in law s expense that he more and more struck himself as enjoying he had needed months and months to arrive at a full appreciation he couldn t originally have given offhand a name to his deepest obligation but by the time the name had flowered in his mind he was practically living at the ease guaranteed him mr verver then in a word took care of his relation to maggie as he took care and apparently always would of everything else he relieved him of all anxiety about his married life in the same manner in which he relieved him on the score of his bank account and as he performed the latter office by communicating with the bankers so the former sprang as directly from his good understanding with his daughter this understanding had wonderfully that was in high evidence the same deep intimacy as the commercial the financial association founded far down on a community of interest and the correspondence for the prince carried itself out in identities of character the vision of which fortunately rather tended to amuse than to as might have happened irritate him those people and his free synthesis lumped together capitalists and bankers retired men of business illustrious collectors american fathers in law american fathers little american daughters little american wives those people were of the same large lucky group as one might say they were all at least of the same general species and had the same general instincts they hung together they passed each other the word they spoke each other s language they did each other turns in this last connection it of course came up for our young man at a given moment that maggie s relation with him was also on the perceived basis taken care of which was in fact the real upshot of the matter it was a funny situation that is it was funny just as it stood their married life was in question but the solution was not less strikingly before them it was all right for himself because mr verver worked it so for maggie s comfort and it was all right for maggie because he worked it so for her husband s the fact that time however was not as we have said wholly on the prince s side might have shown for particularly true one dark day on which by an odd but not unprecedented chance the reflections just noted offered themselves as his main recreation they alone it appeared had been appointed to fill the hours for him and even to fill the great square house in portland place where the scale of one of the smaller saloons fitted them but loosely he had looked into this room on the chance that he might find the princess at tea but though the fireside service of the repast was shiningly present the mistress of the table was not and he had waited for her if waiting it could be called while he measured again and again the stretch of polished floor he could have named to himself no pressing reason for seeing her at this moment and her not coming in as the half hour elapsed became in fact quite positively however perversely the circumstance that kept him on the spot just there he might have been feeling just there he could best take his note this observation was certainly by itself meagre amusement for a dreary little crisis but his walk to and fro and in particular his repeated pause at one of the high front windows gave each of the ebbing minutes none the less after a time a little more of the quality of a quickened throb of the spirit these throbs scarce expressed however the impatience of desire any more than they stood for sharp disappointment the series together resembled perhaps more than anything else those fine waves of clearness through which for a watcher of the east dawn at last trembles into rosy day the illumination indeed was all for the mind the prospect revealed by it a mere immensity of the world of thought the material outlook was all the while a different matter the march afternoon judged at the window had blundered back into autumn it had been raining for hours and the colour of the rain the colour of the air of the mud of the opposite houses of life altogether in so grim a joke so idiotic a masquerade was an unutterable dirty brown there was at first even for the young man no faint flush in the fact of the direction taken while he happened to look out by a slow jogging four wheeled cab which awkwardly deflecting from the middle course at the apparent instance of a person within began to make for the left hand pavement and so at last under further instructions floundered to a full stop before the prince s windows the person within alighting with an easier motion proved to be a lady who left the vehicle to wait and putting up no umbrella quickly crossed the wet interval that separated her from the house she but flitted and disappeared yet the prince from his standpoint had had time to recognise her and the recognition kept him for some minutes motionless charlotte stant at such an hour in a shabby four wheeler and a waterproof charlotte stant turning up for him at the very climax of his special inner vision was an apparition charged with a congruity at which he stared almost as if it had been a violence the effect of her coming to see him him only had while he stood waiting a singular intensity though after some minutes had passed the certainty of this began to drop perhaps she had not come or had come only for maggie perhaps on learning below that the princess had not returned she was merely leaving a message writing a word on a card he should see at any rate and meanwhile controlling himself would do nothing this thought of not interfering took on a sudden force for him she would doubtless hear he was at home but he would let her visit to him be all of her own choosing and his view of a reason for leaving her free was the more remarkable that though taking no step he yet intensely hoped the harmony of her breaking into sight while the superficial conditions were so against her was a harmony with conditions that were far from superficial and that gave for his imagination an extraordinary value to her presence the value deepened strangely moreover with the rigour of his own attitude with the fact too that listening hard he neither heard the house door close again nor saw her go back to her cab and it had risen to a climax by the time he had become aware with his quickened sense that she had followed the butler up to the landing from which his room opened if anything could further then have added to it the renewed pause outside as if she had said to the man wait a moment would have constituted this touch yet when the man had shown her in had advanced to the tea table to light the lamp under the kettle and had then busied himself all deliberately with the fire she made it easy for her host to drop straight from any height of tension and to meet her provisionally on the question of maggie while the butler remained it was maggie that she had come to see and maggie that in spite of this attendant s high blankness on the subject of all possibilities on that lady s part she would cheerfully by the fire wait for as soon as they were alone together however she mounted as with the whizz and the red light of a rocket from the form to the fact saying straight out as she stood and looked at him what else my dear what in the world else can we do it was as if he then knew on the spot why he had been feeling for hours as he had felt as if he in fact knew within the minute things he had not known even while she was panting as from the effect of the staircase at the door of the room he knew at the same time none the less that she knew still more than he in the sense that is of all the signs and portents that might count for them and his vision of alternative she could scarce say what to call them solutions satisfactions opened out altogether with this tangible truth of her attitude by the chimney place the way she looked at him as through the gained advantage of it her right hand resting on the marble and her left keeping her skirt from the fire while she held out a foot to dry he couldn t have told what particular links and gaps had at the end of a few minutes found themselves renewed and bridged for he remembered no occasion in rome from which the picture could have been so exactly copied he remembered that is none of her coming to see him in the rain while a muddy four wheeler waited and while though having left her waterproof downstairs she was yet invested with the odd eloquence the positive picturesqueness yes given all the rest of the matter of a dull dress and a black bowdlerised hat that seemed to make a point of insisting on their time of life and their moral intention the hat s and the frock s own as well as on the irony of indifference to them practically playing in her so handsome rain freshened face the sense of the past revived for him nevertheless as it had not yet done it made that other time somehow meet the future close interlocking with it before his watching eyes as in a long embrace of arms and lips and so handling and hustling the present that this poor quantity scarce retained substance enough scarce remained sufficiently there to be wounded or shocked what had happened in short was that charlotte and he had by a single turn of the wrist of fate led up to indeed no doubt by steps and stages that conscious computation had missed been placed face to face in a freedom that partook extraordinarily of ideal perfection since the magic web had spun itself without their toil almost without their touch above all on this occasion once more there sounded through their safety as an undertone the very voice he had listened to on the eve of his marriage with such another sort of unrest dimly again and again from that period on he had seemed to hear it tell him why it kept recurring but it phrased the large music now in a way that filled the room the reason was into which he had lived quite intimately by the end of a quarter of an hour that just this truth of their safety offered it now a kind of unexampled receptacle letting it spread and spread but at the same time elastically enclosing it banking it in for softness as with billows of eiderdown on that morning in the park there had been however dissimulated doubt and danger whereas the tale this afternoon was taken up with a highly emphasised confidence the emphasis for their general comfort was what charlotte had come to apply inasmuch as though it was not what she definitely began with it had soon irrepressibly shaped itself it was the meaning of the question she had put to him as soon as they were alone even though indeed as from not quite understanding he had not then directly replied it was the meaning of everything else down to the conscious quaintness of her ricketty growler and the conscious humility of her dress it had helped him a little the question of these eccentricities to let her immediate appeal pass without an answer he could ask her instead what had become of her carriage and why above all she was not using it in such weather it s just because of the weather she explained it s my little idea it makes me feel as i used to when i could do as i liked xviii this came out so straight that he saw at once how much truth it expressed yet it was truth that still a little puzzled him but did you ever like knocking about in such discomfort it seems to me now that i then liked everything it s the charm at any rate she said from her place at the fire of trying again the old feelings they come back they come back everything she went on comes back besides she wound up you know for yourself he stood near her his hands in his pockets but not looking at her looking hard at the tea table ah i haven t your courage moreover he laughed it seems to me that so far as that goes i do live in hansoms but you must awfully want your tea he quickly added so let me give you a good stiff cup he busied himself with this care and she sat down on his pushing up a low seat where she had been standing so that while she talked he could bring her what she further desired he moved to and fro before her he helped himself and her visit as the moments passed had more and more the effect of a signal communication that she had come all responsibly and deliberately as on the clear show of the clock face of their situation to make the whole demonstration none the less presented itself as taking place at a very high level of debate in the cool upper air of the finer discrimination the deeper sincerity the larger philosophy no matter what were the facts invoked and arrayed it was only a question as yet of their seeing their way together to which indeed exactly the present occasion appeared to have so much to contribute it s not that you haven t my courage charlotte said but that you haven t i rather think my imagination unless indeed it should turn out after all she added that you haven t even my intelligence however i shall not be afraid of that till you ve given me more proof and she made again but more clearly her point of a moment before you knew besides you knew to day i would come and if you knew that you know everything so she pursued and if he didn t meanwhile if he didn t even at this take her up it might be that she was so positively fitting him again with the fair face of temporising kindness that he had given her to keep her eyes on at the other important juncture and the sense of which she might ever since have been carrying about with her like a precious medal not exactly blessed by the pope suspended round her neck she had come back however this might be to her immediate account of herself and no mention of their great previous passage was to rise to the lips of either above all she said there has been the personal romance of it of tea with me over the fire ah so far as that goes i don t think even my intelligence fails me oh it s further than that goes and if i ve had a better day than you it s perhaps when i come to think of it that i am braver you bore yourself you see but i don t i don t i don t she repeated it s precisely boring one s self without relief he protested that takes courage passive then not active my romance is that if you want to know i ve been all day on the town literally on the town isn t that what they call it i know how it feels after which as if breaking off and you have you never been out she asked he still stood there with his hands in his pockets what should i have gone out for oh what should people in our case do anything for but you re wonderful all of you you know how to live we re clumsy brutes we other s beside you we must always be doing something however charlotte pursued if you had gone out you might have missed the chance of me which i m sure though you won t confess it was what you didn t want and might have missed above all the satisfaction that look blank about it as you will i ve come to congratulate you on that s really what i can at last do you can t not know at least on such a day as this you can t not know she said where you are she waited as for him either to grant that he knew or to pretend that he didn t but he only drew a long deep breath which came out like a moan of impatience it brushed aside the question of where he was or what he knew it seemed to keep the ground clear for the question of his visitor herself that of charlotte verver exactly as she sat there so for some moments with their long look they but treated the matter in silence with the effect indeed by the end of the time of having considerably brought it on this was sufficiently marked in what charlotte next said there it all is extraordinary beyond words it makes such a relation for us as i verily believe was never before in the world thrust upon two well meaning creatures haven t we therefore to take things as we find them she put the question still more directly than that of a moment before but to this one as well he returned no immediate answer noticing only that she had finished her tea he relieved her of her cup carried it back to the table asked her what more she would have and then on her nothing thanks returned to the fire and restored a displaced log to position by a small but almost too effectual kick she had meanwhile got up again and it was on her feet that she repeated the words she had first frankly spoken what else can we do what in all the world else he took them up however no more than at first where then have you been he asked as from mere interest in her adventure everywhere i could think of except to see people i didn t want people i wanted too much to think but i ve been back at intervals three times and then come away again my cabman must think me crazy it s very amusing i shall owe him when we come to settle more money than he has ever seen i ve been my dear she went on to the british museum which you know i always adore and i ve been to the national gallery and to a dozen old booksellers coming across treasures and i ve lunched on some strange nastiness at a cookshop in holborn i wanted to go to the tower but it was too far my old man urged that and i would have gone to the zoo if it hadn t been too wet which he also begged me to observe but you wouldn t believe i did put in st paul s such days she wound up are expensive for besides the cab i ve bought quantities of books she immediately passed at any rate to another point i can t help wondering when you must last have laid eyes on them and then as it had apparently for her companion an effect of abruptness maggie i mean and the child for i suppose you know he s with her oh yes i know he s with her i saw them this morning and did they then announce their programme she told me she was taking him as usual da nonno and for the whole day he hesitated but it was as if his attitude had slowly shifted she didn t say and i didn t ask well she went on it can t have been later than half past ten i mean when you saw them they had got to eaton square before eleven you know we don t formally breakfast adam and i we have tea in our rooms at least i have but luncheon is early and i saw my husband this morning by twelve he was showing the child a picture book maggie had been there with them had left them settled together then she had gone out taking the carriage for something he had been intending but that she offered to do instead the prince appeared to confess at this to his interest taking you mean your carriage i don t know which and it doesn t matter it s not a question she smiled of a carriage the more or the less it s not a question even if you come to that of a cab it s so beautiful she said that it s not a question of anything vulgar or horrid which she gave him time to agree about and though he was silent it was rather remarkably as if he fell in i went out i wanted to i had my idea it seemed to me important it has been it is important i know as i haven t known before the way they feel i couldn t in any other way have made so sure of it they feel a confidence the prince observed he had indeed said it for her they feel a confidence and she proceeded with lucidity to the fuller illustration of it speaking again of the three different moments that in the course of her wild ramble had witnessed her return for curiosity and even really a little from anxiety to eaton square she was possessed of a latch key rarely used it had always irritated adam one of the few things that did to find servants standing up so inhumanly straight when they came home in the small hours after parties so i had but to slip in each time with my cab at the door and make out for myself without their knowing it that maggie was still there i came i went without their so much as dreaming what do they really suppose she asked becomes of one not so much sentimentally or morally so to call it and since that doesn t matter but even just physically materially as a mere wandering woman as a decent harmless wife after all as the best stepmother after all that really ever was or at the least simply as a maitresse de maison not quite without a conscience they must even in their odd way she declared have some idea oh they ve a great deal of idea said the prince and nothing was easier than to mention the quantity they think so much of us they think in particular so much of you ah don t put it all on me she smiled but he was putting it now where she had admirably prepared the place it s a matter of your known character ah thank you for known she still smiled it s a matter of your wonderful cleverness and wonderful charm it s a matter of what those things have done for you in the world i mean in this world and this place you re a personage for them and personages do go and come oh no my dear there you re quite wrong and she laughed now in the happier light they had diffused that s exactly what personages don t do they live in state and under constant consideration they haven t latch keys but drums and trumpets announce them and when they go out in growlers it makes a greater noise still it s you caro mio she said who so far as that goes are the personage ah he in turn protested don t put it all on me what at any rate when you get home he added shall you say that you ve been doing i shall say beautifully that i ve been here all day yes all day keeping you company in your solitude how can we understand anything she went on without really seeing that this is what they must like to think i do for you just as quite as comfortably you do it for me the thing is for us to learn to take them as they are he considered this a while in his restless way but with his eyes not turning from her after which rather disconnectedly though very vehemently he brought out how can i not feel more than anything else how they adore together my boy and then further as if slightly disconcerted she had nothing to meet this and he quickly perceived the effect they would have done the same for one of yours ah if i could have had one i hoped and i believed said charlotte that that would happen it would have been better it would have made perhaps some difference he thought so too poor duck that it might have been i m sure he hoped and intended so it s not at any rate she went on my fault there it is she had uttered these statements one by one gravely sadly and responsibly owing it to her friend to be clear she paused briefly but as if once for all she made her clearness complete and now i m too sure it will never be he waited for a moment never never they treated the matter not exactly with solemnity but with a certain decency even perhaps urgency of distinctness it would probably have been better charlotte added but things turn out and it leaves us she made the point more alone he seemed to wonder it leaves you more alone oh she again returned don t put it all on me maggie would have given herself to his child i m sure scarcely less than he gives himself to yours it would have taken more than any child of mine she explained it would have taken more than ten children of mine could i have had them to keep our sposi apart she smiled as for the breadth of the image but as he seemed to take it in spite of this for important she then spoke gravely enough it s as strange as you like but we re immensely alone he kept vaguely moving but there were moments when again with an awkward ease and his hands in his pockets he was more directly before her he stood there at these last words which had the effect of making him for a little throw back his head and as thinking something out stare up at the ceiling what will you say she meanwhile asked that you ve been doing this brought his consciousness and his eyes back to her and she pointed her question i mean when she comes in for i suppose she will some time come in it seems to me we must say the same thing well he thought again yet i can scarce pretend to have had what i haven t ah what haven t you had what aren t you having her question rang out as they lingered face to face and he still took it before he answered from her eyes we must at least then not to be absurd together do the same thing we must act it would really seem in concert it would really seem her eyebrows her shoulders went up quite in gaiety as for the relief this brought her it s all in the world i pretend we must act in concert heaven knows she said they do so it was that he evidently saw and that by his admission the case could fairly be put but what he evidently saw appeared to come over him at the same time as too much for him so that he fell back suddenly to ground where she was not awaiting him the difficulty is and will always be that i don t understand them i didn t at first but i thought i should learn to that was what i hoped and it appeared then that fanny assingham might help me oh fanny assingham said charlotte verver he stared a moment at her tone she would do anything for us to which charlotte at first said nothing as if from the sense of too much then indulgently enough she shook her head we re beyond her he thought a moment as of where this placed them she d do anything then for them well so would we so that doesn t help us she has broken down she doesn t understand us and really my dear charlotte added fanny assingham doesn t matter he wondered again unless as taking care of them ah charlotte instantly said isn t it for us only to do that she spoke as with a flare of pride for their privilege and their duty i think we want no one s aid she spoke indeed with a nobleness not the less effective for coming in so oddly with a sincerity visible even through the complicated twist by which any effort to protect the father and the daughter seemed necessarily conditioned for them it moved him in any case as if some spring of his own a weaker one had suddenly been broken by it these things all the while the privilege the duty the opportunity had been the substance of his own vision they formed the note he had been keeping back to show her that he was not in their so special situation without a responsible view a conception that he could name and could act on was something that now at last not to be too eminent a fool he was required by all the graces to produce and the luminous idea she had herself uttered would have been his expression of it she had anticipated him but as her expression left for positive beauty nothing to be desired he felt rather righted than wronged a large response as he looked at her came into his face a light of excited perception all his own in the glory of which as it almost might be called what he gave her back had the value of what she had given him they re extraordinarily happy oh charlotte s measure of it was only too full beatifically that s the great thing he went on so that it doesn t matter really that one doesn t understand besides you do enough i understand my husband perhaps she after an instant conceded i don t understand your wife you re of the same race at any rate more or less of the same general tradition and education of the same moral paste there are things you have in common with them but i on my side as i ve gone on trying to see if i haven t some of these things too i on my side have more and more failed there seem at last to be none worth mentioning i can t help seeing it i m decidedly too different yet you re not charlotte made the important point too different from me i don t know as we re not married that brings things out perhaps if we were he said you would find some abyss of divergence since it depends on that then she smiled i m safe as you are anyhow moreover as one has so often had occasion to feel and even to remark they re very very simple that makes she added a difficulty for belief but when once one has taken it in it makes less difficulty for action i have at last for myself i think taken it in i m not afraid he wondered a moment not afraid of what well generally of some beastly mistake especially of any mistake founded on one s idea of their difference for that idea charlotte developed positively makes one so tender ah but rather well then there it is i can t put myself into maggie s skin i can t as i say it s not my fit i shouldn t be able as i see it to breathe in it but i can feel that i d do anything to shield it from a bruise tender as i am for her too she went on i think i m still more so for my husband he s in truth of a sweet simplicity the prince turned over a while the sweet simplicity of mr verver well i don t know that i can choose at night all cats are grey i only see how for so many reasons we ought to stand toward them and how to do ourselves justice we do it represents for us a conscious care of every hour literally said charlotte she could rise to the highest measure of the facts and for which we must trust each other oh as we trust the saints in glory fortunately the prince hastened to add we can with which as for the full assurance and the pledge it involved their hands instinctively found their hands it s all too wonderful firmly and gravely she kept his hand it s too beautiful and so for a minute they stood together as strongly held and as closely confronted as any hour of their easier past even had seen them they were silent at first only facing and faced only grasping and grasped only meeting and met it s sacred he said at last it s sacred she breathed back to him they vowed it gave it out and took it in drawn by their intensity more closely together then of a sudden through this tightened circle as at the issue of a narrow strait into the sea beyond everything broke up broke down gave way melted and mingled their lips sought their lips their pressure their response and their response their pressure with a violence that had sighed itself the next moment to the longest and deepest of stillnesses they passionately sealed their pledge xix he had taken it from her as we have seen moreover that fanny assingham didn t now matter the now he had even himself supplied as no more than fair to his sense of various earlier stages and though his assent remained scarce more than tacit his behaviour for the hour so fell into line that for many days he kept postponing the visit he had promised his old friend on the occasion of their talk at the foreign office with regret none the less would he have seen it quite extinguished that theory of their relation as attached pupil and kind instructress in which they had from the first almost equally found a convenience it had been he no doubt who had most put it forward since his need of knowledge fairly exceeded her mild pretension but he had again and again repeated to her that he should never without her have been where he was and she had not successfully concealed the pleasure it might give her to believe it even after the question of where he was had begun to show itself as rather more closed than open to interpretation it had never indeed before that evening come up as during the passage at the official party and he had for the first time at those moments a little disappointedly got the impression of a certain failure on the dear woman s part of something he was aware of having always rather freely taken for granted in her of what exactly the failure consisted he would still perhaps have felt it a little harsh to try to say and if she had in fact as by charlotte s observation broken down the details of the collapse would be comparatively unimportant they came to the same thing all such collapses the failure of courage the failure of friendship or the failure just simply of tact for didn t any one of them by itself amount really to the failure of wit which was the last thing he had expected of her and which would be but another name for the triumph of stupidity it had been charlotte s remark that they were at last beyond her whereas he had ever enjoyed believing that a certain easy imagination in her would keep up with him to the end he shrank from affixing a label to mrs assingham s want of faith but when he thought at his ease of the way persons who were capable really entertained or at least with any refinement the passion of personal loyalty he figured for them a play of fancy neither timorous nor scrupulous so would his personal loyalty if need be have accepted the adventure for the good creature herself to that definite degree that he had positively almost missed the luxury of some such call from her that was what it all came back to again with these people among whom he was married that one found one used one s imagination mainly for wondering how they contrived so little to appeal to it he felt at moments as if there were never anything to do for them that was worthy to call worthy of the personal relation never any charming charge to take of any confidence deeply reposed he might vulgarly have put it that one had never to plot or to lie for them he might humourously have put it that one had never as by the higher conformity to lie in wait with the dagger or to prepare insidiously the cup these were the services that by all romantic tradition were consecrated to affection quite as much as to hate but he could amuse himself with saying so far as the amusement went that they were what he had once for all turned his back on fanny was meanwhile frequent it appeared in eaton square so much he gathered from the visitor who was not infrequent least of all at tea time during the same period in portland place though they had little need to talk of her after practically agreeing that they had outlived her to the scene of these conversations and suppressions mrs assingham herself made actually no approach her latest view of her utility seeming to be that it had found in eaton square its most urgent field it was finding there in fact everything and everyone but the prince who mostly just now kept away or who at all events on the interspaced occasions of his calling happened not to encounter the only person from whom he was a little estranged it would have been all prodigious if he had not already with charlotte s aid so very considerably lived into it it would have been all indescribably remarkable this fact that with wonderful causes for it so operating on the surface nobody else as yet in the combination seemed estranged from anybody if mrs assingham delighted in maggie she knew by this time how most easily to reach her and if she was unhappy about charlotte she knew by the same reasoning how most probably to miss that vision of her on which affliction would feed it might feed of course on finding her so absent from her home just as this particular phenomenon of her domestic detachment could be by the anxious mind best studied there fanny was however for her reasons shy of portland place itself this was appreciable so that she might well after all have no great light on the question of whether charlotte s appearances there were frequent or not any more than on that of the account they might be keeping of the usual solitude since it came to this of the head of that house there was always to cover all ambiguities to constitute a fund of explanation for the divisions of mrs verver s day the circumstance that at the point they had all reached together mrs verver was definitely and by general acclamation in charge of the social relations of the family literally of those of the two households as to her genius for representing which in the great world and in the grand style vivid evidence had more and more accumulated it had been established in the two households at an early stage and with the highest good humour that charlotte was a was the social success whereas the princess though kind though punctilious though charming though in fact the dearest little creature in the world and the princess into the bargain was distinctly not would distinctly never be and might as well practically give it up whether through being above it or below it too much outside of it or too much lost in it too unequipped or too indisposed didn t especially matter what sufficed was that the whole thing call it appetite or call it patience the act of representation at large and the daily business of intercourse fell in with charlotte s tested facility and not much less visibly with her accommodating her generous view of her domestic use she had come frankly into the connection to do and to be what she could no questions asked and she had taken over accordingly as it stood and in the finest practical spirit the burden of a visiting list that maggie originally left to herself and left even more to the principino had suffered to get inordinately out of hand she had in a word not only mounted cheerfully the london treadmill she had handsomely professed herself for the further comfort of the three others sustained in the effort by a frivolous side if that were not too harsh a name for a pleasant constitutional curiosity there were possibilities of dulness ponderosities of practice arid social sands the bad quarters of an hour that turned up like false pieces in a debased currency of which she made on principle very nearly as light as if she had not been clever enough to distinguish the prince had on this score paid her his compliment soon after her return from her wedding tour in america where by all accounts she had wondrously borne the brunt facing brightly at her husband s side everything that came up and what had come often was beyond words just as precisely with her own interest only at stake she had thrown up the game during the visit paid before her marriage the discussion of the american world the comparison of notes impressions and adventures had been all at hand as a ground of meeting for mrs verver and her husband s son in law from the hour of the reunion of the two couples thus it had been in short that charlotte could for her friend s appreciation so promptly make her point even using expressions from which he let her see at the hour that he drew amusement of his own what could be more simple than one s going through with everything she had asked when it s so plain a part of one s contract i ve got so much by my marriage for she had never for a moment concealed from him how much she had felt it and was finding it that i should deserve no charity if i stinted my return not to do that to give back on the contrary all one can are just one s decency and one s honour and one s virtue these things henceforth if you re interested to know are my rule of life the absolute little gods of my worship the holy images set up on the wall oh yes since i m not a brute she had wound up you shall see me as i am which was therefore as he had seen her dealing always from month to month from day to day and from one occasion to the other with the duties of a remunerated office her perfect her brilliant efficiency had doubtless all the while contributed immensely to the pleasant ease in which her husband and her husband s daughter were lapped it had in fact probably done something more than this it had given them a finer and sweeter view of the possible scope of that ease they had brought her in on the crudest expression of it to do the worldly for them and she had done it with such genius that they had themselves in consequence renounced it even more than they had originally intended in proportion as she did it moreover was she to be relieved of other and humbler doings which minor matters by the properest logic devolved therefore upon maggie in whose chords and whose province they more naturally lay not less naturally by the same token they included the repair at the hands of the latter young woman of every stitch conceivably dropped by charlotte in eaton square this was homely work but that was just what made it maggie s bearing in mind dear amerigo who was so much of her own great mundane feather and whom the homeliness in question didn t no doubt quite equally provide for that would be to balance just in a manner charlotte s very most charming function from the moment charlotte could be got adequately to recognise it well that charlotte might be appraised as at last not ineffectually recognising it was a reflection that during the days with which we are actually engaged completed in the prince s breast these others these images and ruminations of his leisure these gropings and fittings of his conscience and his experience that we have attempted to set in order there they bore him company not insufficiently considering in especial his fuller resources in that line while he worked out to the last lucidity the principle on which he forbore either to seek fanny out in cadogan place or to perpetrate the error of too marked an assiduity in eaton square this error would be his not availing himself to the utmost of the convenience of any artless theory of his constitution or of charlotte s that might prevail there that artless theories could and did prevail was a fact he had ended by accepting under copious evidence as definite and ultimate and it consorted with common prudence with the simplest economy of life not to be wasteful of any odd gleaning to haunt eaton square in fine would be to show that he had not like his brilliant associate a sufficiency of work in the world it was just his having that sufficiency it was just their having it together that so strangely and so blessedly made as they put it to each other everything possible what further propped up the case moreover was that the world by still another beautiful perversity of their chance included portland place without including to anything like the same extent eaton square the latter residence at the same time it must promptly be added did on occasion wake up to opportunity and as giving itself a frolic shake send out a score of invitations one of which fitful flights precisely had before easter the effect of disturbing a little our young man s measure of his margin maggie with a proper spirit held that her father ought from time to time to give a really considered dinner and mr verver who had as little idea as ever of not meeting expectation was of the harmonious opinion that his wife ought charlotte s own judgment was always that they were ideally free the proof of which would always be she maintained that everyone they feared they might most have alienated by neglect would arrive wreathed with smiles on the merest hint of a belated signal wreathed in smiles all round truly enough these apologetic banquets struck amerigo as being they were frankly touching occasions to him marked in the great london bousculade with a small still grace of their own an investing amenity and humanity everybody came everybody rushed but all succumbed to the soft influence and the brutality of mere multitude of curiosity without tenderness was put off at the foot of the fine staircase with the overcoats and shawls the entertainment offered a few evenings before easter and at which maggie and he were inevitably present as guests was a discharge of obligations not insistently incurred and had thereby possibly all the more the note of this almost arcadian optimism a large bright dull murmurous mild eyed middle aged dinner involving for the most part very bland though very exalted immensely announceable and hierarchically placeable couples and followed without the oppression of a later contingent by a brief instrumental concert over the preparation of which the prince knew maggie s anxiety had conferred with charlotte s ingenuity and both had supremely revelled as it were in mr verver s solvency the assinghams were there by prescription though quite at the foot of the social ladder and with the colonel s wife in spite of her humility of position the prince was more inwardly occupied than with any other person except charlotte he was occupied with charlotte because in the first place she looked so inordinately handsome and held so high where so much else was mature and sedate the torch of responsive youth and the standard of passive grace and because of the fact that in the second the occasion so far as it referred itself with any confidence of emphasis to a hostess seemed to refer itself preferentially well meaningly and perversely to maggie it was not indistinguishable to him when once they were all stationed that his wife too had in perfection her own little character but he wondered how it managed so visibly to simplify itself and this he knew in spite of any desire she entertained to the essential air of having overmuch on her mind the felicity and indeed the very conduct and credit of the feast he knew as well the other things of which her appearance was at any time and in eaton square especially made up her resemblance to her father at times so vivid and coming out in the delicate warmth of occasions like the quickened fragrance of a flower her resemblance as he had hit it off for her once in rome in the first flushed days after their engagement to a little dancing girl at rest ever so light of movement but most often panting gently even a shade compunctiously on a bench her approximation finally for it was analogy somehow more than identity to the transmitted images of rather neutral and negative propriety that made up in his long line the average of wifehood and motherhood if the roman matron had been in sufficiency first and last the honour of that line maggie would no doubt at fifty have expanded have solidified to some such dignity even should she suggest a little but a cornelia in miniature a light however broke for him in season and when once it had done so it made him more than ever aware of mrs verver s vaguely yet quite exquisitely contingent participation a mere hinted or tendered discretion in short of mrs verver s indescribable unfathomable relation to the scene her placed condition her natural seat and neighbourhood her intenser presence her quieter smile her fewer jewels were inevitably all as nothing compared with the preoccupation that burned in maggie like a small flame and that had in fact kindled in each of her cheeks a little attesting but fortunately by no means unbecoming spot the party was her father s party and its greater or smaller success was a question having for her all the importance of his importance so that sympathy created for her a sort of visible suspense under pressure of which she bristled with filial reference with little filial recalls of expression movement tone it was all unmistakable and as pretty as possible if one would and even as funny but it put the pair so together as undivided by the marriage of each that the princess il n y avait pas a dire might sit where she liked she would still always in that house be irremediably maggie verver the prince found himself on this occasion so beset with that perception that its natural complement for him would really have been to wonder if mr verver had produced on people something of the same impression in the recorded cases of his having dined with his daughter this backward speculation had it begun to play however would have been easily arrested for it was at present to come over amerigo as never before that his remarkable father in law was the man in the world least equipped with different appearances for different hours he was simple he was a revelation of simplicity and that was the end of him so far as he consisted of an appearance at all a question that might verily for a weakness in it have been argued it amused our young man who was taking his pleasure to night it will be seen in sundry occult ways it amused him to feel how everything else the master of the house consisted of resources possessions facilities and amiabilities amplified by the social legend depended for conveying the effect of quantity on no personal equation no mere measurable medium quantity was in the air for these good people and mr verver s estimable quality was almost wholly in that pervasion he was meagre and modest and clearbrowed and his eyes if they wandered without fear yet stayed without defiance his shoulders were not broad his chest was not high his complexion was not fresh and the crown of his head was not covered in spite of all of which he looked at the top of his table so nearly like a little boy shyly entertaining in virtue of some imposed rank that he could only be one of the powers the representative of a force quite as an infant king is the representative of a dynasty in this generalised view of his father in law intensified to night but always operative amerigo had now for some time taken refuge the refuge after the reunion of the two households in england had more and more offered itself as the substitute for communities from man to man that by his original calculation might have become possible but that had not really ripened and flowered he met the decent family eyes across the table met them afterwards in the music room but only to read in them still what he had learned to read during his first months the time of over anxious initiation a kind of apprehension in which the terms and conditions were finally fixed and absolute this directed regard rested at its ease but it neither lingered nor penetrated and was to the prince s fancy much of the same order as any glance directed for due attention from the same quarter to the figure of a cheque received in the course of business and about to be enclosed to a banker it made sure of the amount and just so from time to time the amount of the prince was made sure he was being thus in renewed instalments perpetually paid in he already reposed in the bank as a value but subject in this comfortable way to repeated to infinite endorsement the net result of all of which moreover was that the young man had no wish to see his value diminish he himself after all had not fixed it the figure was a conception all of mr verver s own certainly however everything must be kept up to it never so much as to night had the prince felt this he would have been uncomfortable as these quiet expressions passed had the case not been guaranteed for him by the intensity of his accord with charlotte it was impossible that he should not now and again meet charlotte s eyes as it was also visible that she too now and again met her husband s for her as well in all his pulses he felt the conveyed impression it put them it kept them together through the vain show of their separation made the two other faces made the whole lapse of the evening the people the lights the flowers the pretended talk the exquisite music a mystic golden bridge between them strongly swaying and sometimes almost vertiginous for that intimacy of which the sovereign law would be the vigilance of care would be never rashly to forget and never consciously to wound xx the main interest of these hours for us however will have been in the way the prince continued to know during a particular succession of others separated from the evening in eaton square by a short interval a certain persistent aftertaste this was the lingering savour of a cup presented to him by fanny assingham s hand after dinner while the clustered quartette kept their ranged companions in the music room moved if one would but conveniently motionless mrs assingham contrived after a couple of pieces to convey to her friend that for her part she was moved by the genius of brahms beyond what she could bear so that without apparent deliberation she had presently floated away at the young man s side to such a distance as permitted them to converse without the effect of disdain it was the twenty minutes enjoyed with her during the rest of the concert in the less associated electric glare of one of the empty rooms it was their achieved and as he would have said successful most pleasantly successful talk on one of the sequestered sofas it was this that was substantially to underlie his consciousness of the later occasion the later occasion then mere matter of discussion had formed her ground for desiring in a light undertone into which his quick ear read indeed some nervousness these independent words with him she had sounded covertly but distinctly by the time they were seated together the great question of what it might involve it had come out for him before anything else and so abruptly that this almost needed an explanation then the abruptness itself had appeared to explain which had introduced in turn a slight awkwardness do you know that they re not after all going to matcham so that if they don t if at least maggie doesn t you won t i suppose go by yourself it was as i say at matcham where the event had placed him it was at matcham during the easter days that it most befell him oddly enough to live over inwardly for its wealth of special significance this passage by which the event had been really a good deal determined he had paid first and last many an english country visit he had learned even from of old to do the english things and to do them all sufficiently in the english way if he didn t always enjoy them madly he enjoyed them at any rate as much to an appearance as the good people who had in the night of time unanimously invented them and who still in the prolonged afternoon of their good faith unanimously even if a trifle automatically practised them yet with it all he had never so much as during such sojourns the trick of a certain detached the amusement of a certain inward critical life the determined need which apparently all participant of returning upon itself of backing noiselessly in far in again and rejoining there as it were that part of his mind that was not engaged at the front his body very constantly was engaged at the front in shooting in riding in golfing in walking over the fine diagonals of meadow paths or round the pocketed corners of billiard tables it sufficiently on the whole in fact bore the brunt of bridge playing of breakfasting lunching tea drinking dining and of the nightly climax over the bottigliera as he called it of the bristling tray it met finally to the extent of the limited tax on lip on gesture on wit most of the current demands of conversation and expression therefore something of him he often felt at these times was left out it was much more when he was alone or when he was with his own people or when he was say with mrs verver and nobody else that he moved that he talked that he listened that he felt as a congruous whole english society as he would have said cut him accordingly in two and he reminded himself often in his relations with it of a man possessed of a shining star a decoration an order of some sort something so ornamental as to make his identity not complete ideally without it yet who finding no other such object generally worn should be perpetually and the least bit ruefully unpinning it from his breast to transfer it to his pocket the prince s shining star may no doubt having been nothing more precious than his private subtlety but whatever the object was he just now fingered it a good deal out of sight amounting as it mainly did for him to a restless play of memory and a fine embroidery of thought something had rather momentously occurred in eaton square during his enjoyed minutes with his old friend his present perspective made definitely clear to him that she had plumped out for him her first little lie that took on and he could scarce have said why a sharpness of importance she had never lied to him before if only because it had never come up for her properly intelligibly morally that she must as soon as she had put to him the question of what he would do by which she meant of what charlotte would also do in that event of maggie s and mr verver s not embracing the proposal they had appeared for a day or two resignedly to entertain as soon as she had betrayed her curiosity as to the line the other pair so left to themselves might take a desire to avoid the appearance of at all too directly prying had become marked in her betrayed by the solicitude of which she had already three weeks before given him a view she had been obliged on a second thought to name intelligibly a reason for her appeal while the prince on his side had had not without mercy his glimpse of her momentarily groping for one and yet remaining unprovided not without mercy because absolutely he had on the spot in his friendliness invented one for her use presenting it to her with a look no more significant than if he had picked up to hand back to her a dropped flower you ask if i m likely also to back out then because it may make a difference in what you and the colonel decide he had gone as far as that for her fairly inviting her to assent though not having had his impression from any indication offered him by charlotte that the assinghams were really in question for the large matcham party the wonderful thing after this was that the active couple had in the interval managed to inscribe themselves on the golden roll an exertion of a sort that to do her justice he had never before observed fanny to make this last passage of the chapter but proved after all with what success she could work when she would once launched himself at any rate as he had been directed by all the terms of the intercourse between portland place and eaton square once steeped at matcham in the enjoyment of a splendid hospitality he found everything for his interpretation for his convenience fall easily enough into place and all the more that mrs verver was at hand to exchange ideas and impressions with the great house was full of people of possible new combinations of the quickened play of possible propinquity and no appearance of course was less to be cultivated than that of his having sought an opportunity to foregather with his friend at a safe distance from their respective sposi there was a happy boldness at the best in their mingling thus each unaccompanied in the same sustained sociability just exactly a touch of that eccentricity of associated freedom which sat so lightly on the imagination of the relatives left behind they were exposed as much as one would to its being pronounced funny that they should at such a rate go about together though on the other hand this consideration drew relief from the fact that in their high conditions and with the easy tradition the almost inspiring allowances of the house in question no individual line however freely marked was pronounced anything more than funny both our friends felt afresh as they had felt before the convenience of a society so placed that it had only its own sensibility to consider looking as it did well over the heads of all lower growths and that moreover treated its own sensibility quite as the easiest friendliest most informal and domesticated party to the general alliance what anyone thought of anyone else above all of anyone else with anyone else was a matter incurring in these lulls so little awkward formulation that hovering judgment the spirit with the scales might perfectly have been imaged there as some rather snubbed and subdued but quite trained and tactful poor relation of equal of the properest lineage only of aspect a little dingy doubtless from too limited a change of dress for whose tacit and abstemious presence never betrayed by a rattle of her rusty machine a room in the attic and a plate at the side table were decently usual it was amusing in such lightness of air that the prince should again present himself only to speak for the princess so unfortunately unable again to leave home and that mrs verver should as regularly figure as an embodied a beautifully deprecating apology for her husband who was all geniality and humility among his own treasures but as to whom the legend had grown up that he couldn t bear with the height of his standards and the tone of the company in the way of sofas and cabinets habitually kept by him the irritation and depression to which promiscuous visiting even at pompous houses had been found to expose him that was all right the noted working harmony of the clever son in law and the charming stepmother so long as the relation was for the effect in question maintained at the proper point between sufficiency and excess what with the noble fairness of the place meanwhile the generous mood of the sunny gusty lusty english april all panting and heaving with impatience or kicking and crying even at moments like some infant hercules who wouldn t be dressed what with these things and the bravery of youth and beauty the insolence of fortune and appetite so diffused among his fellow guests that the poor assinghams in their comparatively marked maturity and their comparatively small splendour were the only approach to a false note in the concert the stir of the air was such for going in a degree to one s head that as a mere matter of exposure almost grotesque in its flagrancy his situation resembled some elaborate practical joke carried out at his expense every voice in the great bright house was a call to the ingenuities and impunities of pleasure every echo was a defiance of difficulty doubt or danger every aspect of the picture a glowing plea for the immediate and as with plenty more to come was another phase of the spell for a world so constituted was governed by a spell that of the smile of the gods and the favour of the powers the only handsome the only gallant in fact the only intelligent acceptance of which was a faith in its guarantees and a high spirit for its chances its demand to that the thing came back was above all for courage and good humour and the value of this as a general assurance that is for seeing one through at the worst had not even in the easiest hours of his old roman life struck the prince so convincingly his old roman life had had more poetry no doubt but as he looked back upon it now it seemed to hang in the air of mere iridescent horizons to have been loose and vague and thin with large languorous unaccountable blanks the present order as it spread about him had somehow the ground under its feet and a trumpet in its ears and a bottomless bag of solid shining british sovereigns which was much to the point in its hand courage and good humour therefore were the breath of the day though for ourselves at least it would have been also much to the point that with amerigo really the innermost effect of all this perceptive ease was perhaps a strange final irritation he compared the lucid result with the extraordinary substitute for perception that presided in the bosom of his wife at so contented a view of his conduct and course a state of mind that was positively like a vicarious good conscience cultivated ingeniously on his behalf a perversity of pressure innocently persisted in and this wonder of irony became on occasion too intense to be kept wholly to himself it wasn t that at matcham anything particular anything monstrous anything that had to be noticed permitted itself as they said to happen there were only odd moments when the breath of the day as it has been called struck him so full in the face that he broke out with all the hilarity of what indeed would they have made of it they were of course maggie and her father moping so far as they ever consented to mope in monotonous eaton square but placid too in the belief that they knew beautifully what their expert companions were in for they knew it might have appeared in these lights absolutely nothing on earth worth speaking of whether beautifully or cynically and they would perhaps sometimes be a little less trying if they would only once for all peacefully admit that knowledge wasn t one of their needs and that they were in fact constitutionally inaccessible to it they were good children bless their hearts and the children of good children so that verily the principino himself as less consistently of that descent might figure to the fancy as the ripest genius of the trio the difficulty was for the nerves of daily intercourse with maggie in particular that her imagination was clearly never ruffled by the sense of any anomaly the great anomaly would have been that her husband or even that her father s wife should prove to have been made for the long run after the pattern set from so far back to the ververs if one was so made one had certainly no business on any terms at matcham whereas if one wasn t one had no business there on the particular terms terms of conformity with the principles of eaton square under which one had been so absurdly dedicated deep at the heart of that resurgent unrest in our young man which we have had to content ourselves with calling his irritation deep in the bosom of this falsity of position glowed the red spark of his inextinguishable sense of a higher and braver propriety there were situations that were ridiculous but that one couldn t yet help as for instance when one s wife chose in the most usual way to make one so precisely here however was the difference it had taken poor maggie to invent a way so extremely unusual yet to which none the less it would be too absurd that he should merely lend himself being thrust systematically with another woman and a woman one happened by the same token exceedingly to like and being so thrust that the theory of it seemed to publish one as idiotic or incapable this was a predicament of which the dignity depended all on one s own handling what was supremely grotesque in fact was the essential opposition of theories as if a galantuomo as he at least constitutionally conceived galantuomini could do anything but blush to go about at such a rate with such a person as mrs verver in a state of childlike innocence the state of our primitive parents before the fall the grotesque theory as he would have called it was perhaps an odd one to resent with violence and he did it also as a man of the world all merciful justice but assuredly none the less there was but one way really to mark and for his companion as much as for himself the commiseration in which they held it adequate comment on it could only be private but it could also at least be active and of rich and effectual comment charlotte and he were fortunately alike capable wasn t this consensus literally their only way not to be ungracious it was positively as if the measure of their escape from that danger were given by the growth between them during their auspicious visit of an exquisite sense of complicity xxi he found himself therefore saying with gaiety even to fanny assingham for their common concerned glance at eaton square the glance that was so markedly never as it might have been a glance at portland place what would our cari sposi have made of it here what would they you know really which overflow would have been reckless if already and surprisingly perhaps even to himself he had not got used to thinking of this friend as a person in whom the element of protest had of late been unmistakably allayed he exposed himself of course to her replying ah if it would have been so bad for them how can it be so good for you but quite apart from the small sense the question would have had at the best she appeared already to unite with him in confidence and cheer he had his view as well or at least a partial one of the inner spring of this present comparative humility which was all consistent with the retraction he had practically seen her make after mr verver s last dinner without diplomatising to do so with no effort to square her none to bribe her to an attitude for which he would have had no use in her if it were not sincere he yet felt how he both held her and moved her by the felicity of his taking pity all instinctively on her just discernible depression by just so much as he guessed that she felt herself as the slang was out of it out of the crystal current and the expensive picture by just so much had his friendship charmingly made up to her from hour to hour for the penalties as they might have been grossly called of her mistake her mistake had only been after all in her wanting to seem to him straight she had let herself in for being as she had made haste for that matter during the very first half hour at tea to proclaim herself the sole and single frump of the party the scale of everything was so different that all her minor values her quainter graces her little local authority her humour and her wardrobe alike for which it was enough elsewhere among her bons amis that they were hers dear fanny assingham s these matters and others would be all now as nought five minutes had sufficed to give her the fatal pitch in cadogan place she could always at the worst be picturesque for she habitually spoke of herself as local to sloane street whereas at matcham she should never be anything but horrible and it all would have come the disaster from the real refinement in her of the spirit of friendship to prove to him that she wasn t really watching him ground for which would have been too terribly grave she had followed him in his pursuit of pleasure so she might precisely mark her detachment this was handsome trouble for her to take the prince could see it all it wasn t a shade of interference that a good natured man would visit on her so he didn t even say when she told him how frumpy she knew herself how frumpy her very maid odiously going back on her rubbed it into her night and morning with unsealed eyes and lips that she now knew her he didn t then say ah see what you ve done isn t it rather your own fault he behaved differently altogether eminently distinguished himself for she told him she had never seen him so universally distinguished he yet distinguished her in her obscurity or in what was worse her objective absurdity and frankly invested her with her absolute value surrounded her with all the importance of her wit that wit as discriminated from stature and complexion a sense for bridge and a credit for pearls could have importance was meanwhile but dimly perceived at matcham so that his niceness to her she called it only niceness but it brought tears into her eyes had the greatness of a general as well as of a special demonstration she understands he said as a comment on all this to mrs verver she understands all she needs to understand she has taken her time but she has at last made it out for herself she sees how all we can desire is to give them the life they prefer to surround them with the peace and quiet and above all with the sense of security most favourable to it she can t of course very well put it to us that we have so far as she is concerned but to make the best of our circumstances she can t say in so many words don t think of me for i too must make the best of mine arrange as you can only and live as you must i don t get quite that from her any more than i ask for it but her tone and her whole manner mean nothing at all unless they mean that she trusts us to take as watchful to take as artful to take as tender care in our way as she so anxiously takes in hers so that she s well the prince wound up what you may call practically all right charlotte in fact however to help out his confidence didn t call it anything return as he might to the lucidity the importance or whatever it was of this lesson she gave him no aid toward reading it aloud she let him two or three times over spell it out for himself only on the eve of their visit s end was she for once clear or direct in response they had found a minute together in the great hall of the house during the half hour before dinner this easiest of chances they had already a couple of times arrived at by waiting persistently till the last other loiterers had gone to dress and by being prepared themselves to dress so expeditiously that they might a little later on be among the first to appear in festal array the hall then was empty before the army of rearranging cushion patting housemaids were marshalled in and there was a place by the forsaken fire at one end where they might imitate with art the unpremeditated above all here for the snatched instants they could breathe so near to each other that the interval was almost engulfed in it and the intensity both of the union and the caution became a workable substitute for contact they had prolongations of instants that counted as visions of bliss they had slow approximations that counted as long caresses the quality of these passages in truth made the spoken word and especially the spoken word about other people fall below them so that our young woman s tone had even now a certain dryness it s very good of her my dear to trust us but what else can she do why whatever people do when they don t trust let one see they don t but let whom see well let me say to begin with and should you mind that he had a slight show of surprise shouldn t you her letting you see no said charlotte the only thing i can imagine myself minding is what you yourself if you don t look out may let her see to which she added you may let her see you know that you re afraid i m only afraid of you a little at moments he presently returned but i shan t let fanny see that it was clear however that neither the limits nor the extent of mrs assingham s vision were now a real concern to her and she gave expression to this as she had not even yet done what in the world can she do against us there s not a word that she can breathe she s helpless she can t speak she would be herself the first to be dished by it and then as he seemed slow to follow it all comes back to her it all began with her everything from the first she introduced you to maggie she made your marriage the prince might have had his moment of demur but at this after a little as with a smile dim but deep he came on mayn t she also be said a good deal to have made yours that was intended i think wasn t it for a kind of rectification charlotte on her side for an instant hesitated then she was prompter still i don t mean there was anything to rectify everything was as it had to be and i m not speaking of how she may have been concerned for you and me i m speaking of how she took in her way each time their lives in hand and how therefore that ties her up to day she can t go to them and say it s very awkward of course you poor dear things but i was frivolously mistaken he took it in still with his long look at her all the more that she wasn t she was right everything s right he went on and everything will stay so then that s all i say but he worked it out for the deeper satisfaction even to superfluous lucidity we re happy and they re happy what more does the position admit of what more need fanny assingham want ah my dear said charlotte it s not i who say that she need want anything i only say that she s fixed that she must stand exactly where everything has by her own act placed her it s you who have seemed haunted with the possibility for her of some injurious alternative something or other we must be prepared for and she had with her high reasoning a strange cold smile we are prepared for anything for everything and as we are practically so she must take us she s condemned to consistency she s doomed poor thing to a genial optimism that luckily for her however is very much the law of her nature she was born to soothe and to smooth now then therefore mrs verver gently laughed she has the chance of her life so that her present professions may even at the best not be sincere may be but a mask for doubts and fears and for gaining time the prince had looked with the question as if this again could trouble him and it determined in his companion a slight impatience you keep talking about such things as if they were our affair at all i feel at any rate that i ve nothing to do with her doubts and fears or with anything she may feel she must arrange all that for herself it s enough for me that she ll always be of necessity much more afraid for herself really either to see or to speak than we should be to have her do it even if we were the idiots and cowards we aren t and charlotte s face with these words to the mitigation of the slightly hard ring there might otherwise have been in them fairly lightened softened shone out it reflected as really never yet the rare felicity of their luck it made her look for the moment as if she had actually pronounced that word of unpermitted presumption so apt is the countenance as with a finer consciousness than the tongue to betray a sense of this particular lapse she might indeed the next instant have seen her friend wince in advance at her use of a word that was already on her lips for it was still unmistakable with him that there were things he could prize forms of fortune he could cherish without at all proportionately liking their names had all this however been even completely present to his companion what other term could she have applied to the strongest and simplest of her ideas but the one that exactly fitted it she applied it then though her own instinct moved her at the same time to pay her tribute to the good taste from which they hadn t heretofore by a hair s breadth deviated if it didn t sound so vulgar i should say that we re fatally as it were safe pardon the low expression since it s what we happen to be we re so because they are and they re so because they can t be anything else from the moment that having originally intervened for them she wouldn t now be able to bear herself if she didn t keep them so that s the way she s inevitably with us said charlotte over her smile we hang essentially together well the prince candidly allowed she did bring it home to him every way it worked out yes i see we hang essentially together his friend had a shrug a shrug that had a grace cosa volete the effect beautifully nobly was more than roman ah beyond doubt it s a case he stood looking at her it s a case there can t he said have been many perhaps never never never any other that she smiled i confess i should like to think only ours only ours most probably speriamo to which as after hushed connections he presently added poor fanny but charlotte had already with a start and a warning hand turned from a glance at the clock she sailed away to dress while he watched her reach the staircase his eyes followed her till with a simple swift look round at him she vanished something in the sight however appeared to have renewed the spring of his last exclamation which he breathed again upon the air poor poor fanny it was to prove however on the morrow quite consistent with the spirit of these words that the party at matcham breaking up and multitudinously dispersing he should be able to meet the question of the social side of the process of repatriation with due presence of mind it was impossible for reasons that he should travel to town with the assinghams it was impossible for the same reasons that he should travel to town save in the conditions that he had for the last twenty four hours been privately and it might have been said profoundly thinking out the result of his thought was already precious to him and this put at his service he sufficiently believed the right tone for disposing of his elder friend s suggestion an assumption in fact equally full and mild that he and charlotte would conveniently take the same train and occupy the same compartment as the colonel and herself the extension of the idea to mrs verver had been precisely a part of mrs assingham s mildness and nothing could better have characterised her sense for social shades than her easy perception that the gentleman from portland place and the lady from eaton square might now confess quite without indiscretion to simultaneity of movement she had made for the four days no direct appeal to the latter personage but the prince was accidental witness of her taking a fresh start at the moment the company were about to scatter for the last night of their stay there had been at this climax the usual preparatory talk about hours and combinations in the midst of which poor fanny gently approached mrs verver she said you and the prince love quite apparently without blinking she took for granted their public withdrawal together she remarked that she and bob were alike ready in the interest of sociability to take any train that would make them all one party i feel really as if all this time i had seen nothing of you that gave an added grace to the candour of the dear thing s approach but just then it was on the other hand that the young man found himself borrow most effectively the secret of the right tone for doing as he preferred his preference had during the evening not failed of occasion to press him with mute insistences practically without words without any sort of straight telegraphy it had arrived at a felt identity with charlotte s own she spoke all for their friend while she answered their friend s question but she none the less signalled to him as definitely as if she had fluttered a white handkerchief from a window it s awfully sweet of you darling our going together would be charming but you mustn t mind us you must suit yourselves we ve settled amerigo and i to stay over till after luncheon amerigo with the chink of this gold in his ear turned straight away so as not to be instantly appealed to and for the very emotion of the wonder furthermore of what divination may achieve when winged by a community of passion charlotte had uttered the exact plea that he had been keeping ready for the same foreseen necessity and had uttered it simply as a consequence of their deepening unexpressed need of each other and without the passing between them of a word he hadn t god knew to take it from her he was too conscious of what he wanted but the lesson for him was in the straight clear tone that charlotte could thus distil in the perfect felicity of her adding no explanation no touch for plausibility that she wasn t strictly obliged to add and in the truly superior way in which women so situated express and distinguish themselves she had answered mrs assingham quite adequately she had not spoiled it by a reason a scrap larger than the smallest that would serve and she had above all thrown off for his stretched but covered attention an image that flashed like a mirror played at the face of the sun the measure of everything to all his sense at these moments was in it the measure especially of the thought that had been growing with him a positive obsession and that began to throb as never yet under this brush of her having by perfect parity of imagination the match for it his whole consciousness had by this time begun almost to ache with a truth of an exquisite order at the glow of which she too had so unmistakably then been warming herself the truth that the occasion constituted by the last few days couldn t possibly save by some poverty of their own refuse them some still other and still greater beauty it had already told them with an hourly voice that it had a meaning a meaning that their associated sense was to drain even as thirsty lips after the plough through the sands and the sight afar of the palm cluster might drink in at last the promised well in the desert there had been beauty day after day and there had been for the spiritual lips something of the pervasive taste of it yet it was all none the less as if their response had remained below their fortune how to bring it by some brave free lift up to the same height was the idea with which behind and beneath everything he was restlessly occupied and in the exploration of which as in that of the sun chequered greenwood of romance his spirit thus at the opening of a vista met hers they were already from that moment so hand in hand in the place that he found himself making use five minutes later of exactly the same tone as charlotte s for telling mrs assingham that he was likewise in the matter of the return to london sorry for what mightn t be this had become of a sudden the simplest thing in the world the sense of which moreover seemed really to amount to a portent that he should feel forevermore on the general head conveniently at his ease with her he went in fact a step further than charlotte put the latter forward as creating his necessity she was staying over luncheon to oblige their hostess as a consequence of which he must also stay to see her decently home he must deliver her safe and sound he felt in eaton square regret as he might too the difference made by this obligation he frankly didn t mind inasmuch as over and above the pleasure itself his scruple would certainly gratify both mr verver and maggie they never yet had absolutely and entirely learned he even found deliberation to intimate how little he really neglected the first as it seemed nowadays quite to have become of his domestic duties therefore he still constantly felt how little he must remit his effort to make them remark it to which he added with equal lucidity that they would return in time for dinner and if he didn t as a last word subjoin that it would be lovely of fanny to find on her own return a moment to go to eaton square and report them as struggling bravely on this was not because the impulse down to the very name for the amiable act altogether failed to rise his inward assurance his general plan had at moments where she was concerned its drops of continuity and nothing would less have pleased him than that she should suspect in him however tempted any element of conscious cheek but he was always that was really the upshot cultivating thanklessly the considerate and the delicate it was a long lesson this unlearning with people of english race all the little superstitions that accompany friendship mrs assingham herself was the first to say that she would unfailingly report she brought it out in fact he thought quite wonderfully having attained the summit of the wonderful during the brief interval that had separated her appeal to charlotte from this passage with himself she had taken the five minutes obviously amid the rest of the talk and the movement to retire into her tent for meditation which showed among several things the impression charlotte had made on her it was from the tent she emerged as with arms refurbished though who indeed could say if the manner in which she now met him spoke most really of the glitter of battle or of the white waver of the flag of truce the parley was short either way the gallantry of her offer was all sufficient i ll go to our friends then i ll ask for luncheon i ll tell them when to expect you that will be charming say we re all right all right precisely i can t say more mrs assingham smiled no doubt but he considered as for the possible importance of it neither can you by what i seem to feel say less oh i won t say less fanny laughed with which the next moment she had turned away but they had it again not less bravely on the morrow after breakfast in the thick of the advancing carriages and the exchange of farewells i think i ll send home my maid from euston she was then prepared to amend and go to eaton square straight so you can be easy oh i think we re easy the prince returned be sure to say at any rate that we re bearing up you re bearing up good and charlotte returns to dinner to dinner we re not likely i think to make another night away well then i wish you at least a pleasant day oh he laughed as they separated we shall do our best for it after which in due course with the announcement of their conveyance the assinghams rolled off xxii it was quite for the prince after this as if the view had further cleared so that the half hour during which he strolled on the terrace and smoked the day being lovely overflowed with the plenitude of its particular quality its general brightness was composed doubtless of many elements but what shone out of it as if the whole place and time had been a great picture from the hand of genius presented to him as a prime ornament for his collection and all varnished and framed to hang up what marked it especially for the highest appreciation was his extraordinarily unchallenged his absolutely appointed and enhanced possession of it poor fanny assingham s challenge amounted to nothing one of the things he thought of while he leaned on the old marble balustrade so like others that he knew in still more nobly terraced italy was that she was squared all conveniently even to herself and that rumbling toward london with this contentment she had become an image irrelevant to the scene it further passed across him as his imagination was for reasons during the time unprecedentedly active that he had after all gained more from women than he had ever lost by them there appeared so more and more on those mystic books that are kept in connection with such commerce even by men of the loosest business habits a balance in his favour that he could pretty well as a rule take for granted what were they doing at this very moment wonderful creatures but combine and conspire for his advantage from maggie herself most wonderful in her way of all to his hostess of the present hour into whose head it had so inevitably come to keep charlotte on for reasons of her own and who had asked in this benevolent spirit why in the world if not obliged without plausibility to hurry her husband s son in law should not wait over in her company he would at least see lady castledean had said that nothing dreadful should happen to her either while still there or during the exposure of the run to town and for that matter if they exceeded a little their license it would positively help them to have done so together each of them would in this way at home have the other comfortably to blame all of which besides in lady castledean as in maggie in fanny assingham as in charlotte herself was working for him without provocation or pressure by the mere play of some vague sense on their part definite and conscious at the most only in charlotte that he was not as a nature as a character as a gentleman in fine below his remarkable fortune but there were more things before him than even these things that melted together almost indistinguishably to feed his sense of beauty if the outlook was in every way spacious and the towers of three cathedrals in different counties as had been pointed out to him gleamed discernibly like dim silver in the rich sameness of tone didn t he somehow the more feel it so because precisely lady castledean had kept over a man of her own and that this offered a certain sweet intelligibility as the note of the day it made everything fit above all it diverted him to the extent of keeping up while he lingered and waited his meditative smile she had detained charlotte because she wished to detain mr blint and she couldn t detain mr blint disposed though he clearly was to oblige her without spreading over the act some ampler drapery castledean had gone up to london the place was all her own she had had a fancy for a quiet morning with mr blint a sleek civil accomplished young man distinctly younger than her ladyship who played and sang delightfully played even bridge and sang the english comic as well as the french tragic and the presence which really meant the absence of a couple of other friends if they were happily chosen would make everything all right the prince had the sense all good humouredly of being happily chosen and it was not spoiled for him even by another sense that followed in its train and with which during his life in england he had more than once had reflectively to deal the state of being reminded how after all as an outsider a foreigner and even as a mere representative husband and son in law he was so irrelevant to the working of affairs that he could be bent on occasion to uses comparatively trivial no other of her guests would have been thus convenient for their hostess affairs of whatever sorts had claimed by early trains every active easy smoothly working man each in his way a lubricated item of the great social political administrative engrenage claimed most of all castledean himself who was so very oddly given the personage and the type rather a large item if he on the other hand had an affair it was not of that order it was of the order verily that he had been reduced to as a not quite glorious substitute it marked however the feeling of the hour with him that this vision of being reduced interfered not at all with the measure of his actual ease it kept before him again at moments the so familiar fact of his sacrifices down to the idea of the very relinquishment for his wife s convenience of his real situation in the world with the consequence thus that he was in the last analysis among all these so often inferior people practically held cheap and made light of but though all this was sensible enough there was a spirit in him that could rise above it a spirit that positively played with the facts with all of them from that of the droll ambiguity of english relations to that of his having in mind something quite beautiful and independent and harmonious something wholly his own he couldn t somehow take mr blint seriously he was much more an outsider by the larger scale even than a roman prince who consented to be in abeyance yet it was past finding out either how such a woman as lady castledean could take him since this question but sank for him again into the fathomless depths of english equivocation he knew them all as was said well he had lived with them stayed with them dined hunted shot and done various other things with them but the number of questions about them he couldn t have answered had much rather grown than shrunken so that experience struck him for the most part as having left in him but one residual impression they didn t like les situations nettes that was all he was very sure of they wouldn t have them at any price it had been their national genius and their national success to avoid them at every point they called it themselves with complacency their wonderful spirit of compromise the very influence of which actually so hung about him here from moment to moment that the earth and the air the light and the colour the fields and the hills and the sky the blue green counties and the cold cathedrals owed to it every accent of their tone verily as one had to feel in presence of such a picture it had succeeded it had made up to now for that seated solidity in the rich sea mist on which the garish the supposedly envious peoples have ever cooled their eyes but it was at the same time precisely why even much initiation left one at given moments so puzzled as to the element of staleness in all the freshness and of freshness in all the staleness of innocence in the guilt and of guilt in the innocence there were other marble terraces sweeping more purple prospects on which he would have known what to think and would have enjoyed thereby at least the small intellectual fillip of a discerned relation between a given appearance and a taken meaning the inquiring mind in these present conditions might it was true be more sharply challenged but the result of its attention and its ingenuity it had unluckily learned to know was too often to be confronted with a mere dead wall a lapse of logic a confirmed bewilderment and moreover above all nothing mattered in the relation of the enclosing scene to his own consciousness but its very most direct bearings lady castledean s dream of mr blint for the morning was doubtless already with all the spacious harmonies re established taking the form of going over something with him at the piano in one of the numerous smaller rooms that were consecrated to the less gregarious uses what she had wished had been effected her convenience had been assured this made him however wonder the more where charlotte was since he didn t at all suppose her to be making a tactless third which would be to have accepted mere spectatorship in the duet of their companions the upshot of everything for him alike of the less and of the more was that the exquisite day bloomed there like a large fragrant flower that he had only to gather but it was to charlotte he wished to make the offering and as he moved along the terrace which rendered visible parts of two sides of the house he looked up at all the windows that were open to the april morning and wondered which of them would represent his friend s room it befell thus that his question after no long time was answered he saw charlotte appear above as if she had been called by the pausing of his feet on the flags she had come to the sill on which she leaned to look down and she remained there a minute smiling at him he had been immediately struck with her wearing a hat and a jacket which conduced to her appearance of readiness not so much to join him with a beautiful uncovered head and a parasol where he stood as to take with him some larger step altogether the larger step had been since the evening before intensely in his own mind though he had not fully thought out even yet the slightly difficult detail of it but he had had no chance such as he needed to speak the definite word to her and the face she now showed affected him accordingly as a notice that she had wonderfully guessed it for herself they had these identities of impulse they had had them repeatedly before and if such unarranged but unerring encounters gave the measure of the degree in which people were in the common phrase meant for each other no union in the world had ever been more sweetened with rightness what in fact most often happened was that her rightness went as who should say even further than his own they were conscious of the same necessity at the same moment only it was she as a general thing who most clearly saw her way to it something in her long look at him now out of the old grey window something in the very poise of her hat the colour of her necktie the prolonged stillness of her smile touched into sudden light for him all the wealth of the fact that he could count on her he had his hand there to pluck it on the open bloom of the day but what did the bright minute mean but that her answering hand was already intelligently out so therefore while the minute lasted it passed between them that their cup was full which cup their very eyes holding it fast carried and steadied and began as they tasted it to praise he broke however after a moment the silence it only wants a moon a mandolin and a little danger to be a serenade ah then she lightly called down let it at least have this with which she detached a rich white rosebud from its company with another in the front of her dress and flung it down to him he caught it in its fall fixing her again after she had watched him place it in his buttonhole come down quickly he said in an italian not loud but deep vengo vengo she as clearly but more lightly tossed out and she had left him the next minute to wait for her he came along the terrace again with pauses during which his eyes rested as they had already often done on the brave darker wash of far away watercolour that represented the most distant of the cathedral towns this place with its great church and its high accessibility its towers that distinguishably signalled its english history its appealing type its acknowledged interest this place had sounded its name to him half the night through and its name had become but another name the pronounceable and convenient one for that supreme sense of things which now throbbed within him he had kept saying to himself gloucester gloucester gloucester quite as if the sharpest meaning of all the years just passed were intensely expressed in it that meaning was really that his situation remained quite sublimely consistent with itself and that they absolutely he and charlotte stood there together in the very lustre of this truth every present circumstance helped to proclaim it it was blown into their faces as by the lips of the morning he knew why from the first of his marriage he had tried with such patience for such conformity he knew why he had given up so much and bored himself so much he knew why he at any rate had gone in on the basis of all forms on the basis of his having in a manner sold himself for a situation nette it had all been just in order that his well what on earth should he call it but his freedom should at present be as perfect and rounded and lustrous as some huge precious pearl he hadn t struggled nor snatched he was taking but what had been given him the pearl dropped itself with its exquisite quality and rarity straight into his hand here precisely it was incarnate its size and its value grew as mrs verver appeared afar off in one of the smaller doorways she came toward him in silence while he moved to meet her the great scale of this particular front at matcham multiplied thus in the golden morning the stages of their meeting and the successions of their consciousness it wasn t till she had come quite close that he produced for her his gloucester gloucester gloucester and his look at it over there she knew just where to look yes isn t it one of the best there are cloisters or towers or some thing and her eyes which though her lips smiled were almost grave with their depths of acceptance came back to him or the tomb of some old king we must see the old king we must do the cathedral he said we must know all about it if we could but take he exhaled the full opportunity and then while for all they seemed to give him he sounded again her eyes i feel the day like a great gold cup that we must somehow drain together i feel it as you always make me feel everything just as you do so that i know ten miles off how you feel but do you remember she asked apropos of great gold cups the beautiful one the real one that i offered you so long ago and that you wouldn t have just before your marriage she brought it back to him the gilded crystal bowl in the little bloomsbury shop oh yes but it took with a slight surprise on the prince s part some small recollecting the treacherous cracked thing you wanted to palm off on me and the little swindling jew who understood italian and who backed you up but i feel this an occasion he immediately added and i hope you don t mean he smiled that as an occasion it s also cracked they spoke naturally more low than loud overlooked as they were though at a respectful distance by tiers of windows but it made each find in the other s voice a taste as of something slowly and deeply absorbed don t you think too much of cracks and aren t you too afraid of them i risk the cracks said charlotte and i ve often recalled the bowl and the little swindling jew wondering if they ve parted company he made she said a great impression on me well you also no doubt made a great impression on him and i dare say that if you were to go back to him you d find he has been keeping that treasure for you but as to cracks the prince went on what did you tell me the other day you prettily call them in english rifts within the lute risk them as much as you like for yourself but don t risk them for me he spoke it in all the gaiety of his just barely tremulous serenity i go as you know by my superstitions and that s why he said i know where we are they re every one to day on our side resting on the parapet toward the great view she was silent a little and he saw the next moment that her eyes were closed i go but by one thing her hand was on the sun warmed stone so that turned as they were away from the house he put his own upon it and covered it i go by you she said i go by you so they remained a moment till he spoke again with a gesture that matched what is really our great necessity you know is to go by my watch it s already eleven he had looked at the time so that if we stop here to luncheon what becomes of our afternoon to this charlotte s eyes opened straight there s not the slightest need of our stopping here to luncheon don t you see she asked how i m ready he had taken it in but there was always more and more of her you mean you ve arranged it s easy to arrange my maid goes up with my things you ve only to speak to your man about yours and they can go together you mean we can leave at once she let him have it all one of the carriages about which i spoke will already have come back for us if your superstitions are on our side she smiled so my arrangements are and i ll back my support against yours then you had thought he wondered about gloucester she hesitated but it was only her way i thought you would think we have thank goodness these harmonies they are food for superstition if you like it s beautiful she went on that it should be gloucester glo ster glo ster as you say making it sound like an old song however i m sure glo ster glo ster will be charming she still added we shall be able easily to lunch there and with our luggage and our servants off our hands we shall have at least three or four hours we can wire she wound up from there ever so quietly she had brought it as she had thought it all out and it had to be as covertly that he let his appreciation expand then lady castledean doesn t dream of our staying he took it but thinking yet then what does she dream of mr blint poor dear of mr blint only her smile for him for the prince himself was free have i positively to tell you that she doesn t want us she only wanted us for the others to show she wasn t left alone with him now that that s done and that they ve all gone she of course knows for herself knows the prince vaguely echoed why that we like cathedrals that we inevitably stop to see them or go round to take them in whenever we ve a chance that it s what our respective families quite expect of us and would be disappointed for us to fail of this as forestieri mrs verver pursued would be our pull if our pull weren t indeed so great all round he could only keep his eyes on her and have you made out the very train the very one paddington the in that gives us oceans we can dine at the usual hour at home and as maggie will of course be in eaton square i hereby invite you for a while he still but looked at her it was a minute before he spoke thank you very much with pleasure to which he in a moment added but the train for gloucester a local one with several stops but doing it a good deal i forget how much within the hour so that we ve time only she said we must employ our time he roused himself as from the mere momentary spell of her he looked again at his watch while they moved back to the door through which she had advanced but he had also again questions and stops all as for the mystery and the charm you looked it up without my having asked you ah my dear she laughed i ve seen you with bradshaw it takes anglo saxon blood blood he echoed you ve that of every race it kept her before him you re terrible well he could put it as he liked i know the name of the inn what is it then there are two you ll see but i ve chosen the right one and i think i remember the tomb she smiled oh the tomb any tomb would do for him but i mean i had been keeping my idea so cleverly for you while there you already were with it you had been keeping it for me as much as you like but how do you make out she asked that you were keeping it from me i don t now how shall i ever keep anything some day when i shall wish to ah for things i mayn t want to know i promise you shall find me stupid they had reached their door where she herself paused to explain these days yesterday last night this morning i ve wanted everything well it was all right you shall have everything xxiii fanny on her arrival in town carried out her second idea despatching the colonel to his club for luncheon and packing her maid into a cab for cadogan place with the variety of their effects the result of this for each of the pair was a state of occupation so unbroken that the day practically passed without fresh contact between them they dined out together but it was both in going to their dinner and in coming back that they appeared on either side to have least to communicate fanny was wrapped in her thoughts still more closely than in the lemon coloured mantle that protected her bare shoulders and her husband with her silence to deal with showed himself not less disposed than usual when so challenged to hold up as he would have said his end of it they had in general in these days longer pauses and more abrupt transitions in one of which latter they found themselves for a climax launched at midnight mrs assingham rather wearily housed again ascended to the first floor there to sink overburdened on the landing outside the drawing room into a great gilded venetian chair of which at first however she but made with her brooding face a sort of throne of meditation she would thus have recalled a little with her so free orientalism of type the immemorially speechless sphinx about at last to become articulate the colonel not unlike on his side some old pilgrim of the desert camping at the foot of that monument went by way of reconnoissance into the drawing room he visited according to his wont the windows and their fastenings he cast round the place the eye all at once of the master and the manager the commandant and the rate payer then he came back to his wife before whom for a moment he stood waiting but she herself for a time continued to wait only looking up at him inscrutably there was in these minor manoeuvres and conscious patiences something of a suspension of their old custom of divergent discussion that intercourse by misunderstanding which had grown so clumsy now this familiar pleasantry seemed to desire to show it could yield on occasion to any clear trouble though it was also sensibly and just incoherently in the air that no trouble was at present to be vulgarly recognised as clear there might for that matter even have been in mr assingham s face a mild perception of some finer sense a sense for his wife s situation and the very situation she was oddly enough about to repudiate that she had fairly caused to grow in him but it was a flower to breathe upon gently and this was very much what she finally did she knew he needed no telling that she had given herself all the afternoon to her friends in eaton square and that her doing so would have been but the prompt result of impressions gathered in quantities in brimming baskets like the purple grapes of the vintage at matcham a process surrounded by him while it so unmistakably went on with abstentions and discretions that might almost have counted as solemnities the solemnities at the same time had committed him to nothing to nothing beyond this confession itself of a consciousness of deep waters she had been out on these waters for him visibly and his tribute to the fact had been his keeping her even if without a word well in sight he had not quitted for an hour during her adventure the shore of the mystic lake he had on the contrary stationed himself where she could signal to him at need her need would have arisen if the planks of her bark had parted then some sort of plunge would have become his immediate duty his present position clearly was that of seeing her in the centre of her sheet of dark water and of wondering if her actual mute gaze at him didn t perhaps mean that her planks were now parting he held himself so ready that it was quite as if the inward man had pulled off coat and waistcoat before he had plunged however that is before he had uttered a question he perceived not without relief that she was making for land he watched her steadily paddle always a little nearer and at last he felt her boat bump the bump was distinct and in fact she stepped ashore we were all wrong there s nothing nothing it was like giving her his hand up the bank between charlotte verver and the prince i was uneasy but i m satisfied now i was in fact quite mistaken there s nothing but i thought said bob assingham that that was just what you did persistently asseverate you ve guaranteed their straightness from the first no i ve never till now guaranteed anything but my own disposition to worry i ve never till now fanny went on gravely from her chair had such a chance to see and to judge i had it at that place if i had in my infatuation and my folly she added with expression nothing else so i did see i have seen and now i know her emphasis as she repeated the word made her head in her seat of infallibility rise higher i know the colonel took it but took it at first in silence do you mean they ve told you no i mean nothing so absurd for in the first place i haven t asked them and in the second their word in such a matter wouldn t count oh said the colonel with all his oddity they d tell us it made her face him an instant as with her old impatience of his short cuts always across her finest flower beds but she felt none the less that she kept her irony down then when they ve told you you ll be perhaps so good as to let me know he jerked up his chin testing the growth of his beard with the back of his hand while he fixed her with a single eye ah i don t say that they d necessarily tell me that they are over the traces they ll necessarily whatever happens hold their tongues i hope and i m talking of them now as i take them for myself only that s enough for me it s all i have to regard with which after an instant they re wonderful said fanny assingham indeed her husband concurred i really think they are you d think it still more if you knew but you don t know because you don t see their situation this was what he didn t see is too extraordinary too he was willing to try too extraordinary to be believed i mean if one didn t see but just that in a way is what saves them they take it seriously he followed at his own pace their situation the incredible side of it they make it credible credible then you do say to you she looked at him again for an interval they believe in it themselves they take it for what it is and that she said saves them but if what it is is just their chance it s their chance for what i told you when charlotte first turned up it s their chance for the idea that i was then sure she had the colonel showed his effort to recall oh your idea at different moments of any one of their ideas this dim procession visibly mustered before him and with the best will in the world he could but watch its immensity are you speaking now of something to which you can comfortably settle down again for a little she only glowered at him i ve come back to my belief and that i have done so well he asked as she paused well shows that i m right for i assure you i had wandered far now i m at home again and i mean said fanny assingham to stay here they re beautiful she declared the prince and charlotte the prince and charlotte that s how they re so remarkable and the beauty she explained is that they re afraid for them afraid i mean for the others for mr verver and maggie it did take some following afraid of what afraid of themselves the colonel wondered of themselves of mr verver s and maggie s selves mrs assingham remained patient as well as lucid yes of such blindness too but most of all of their own danger he turned it over that danger being the blindness that danger being their position what their position contains of all the elements i needn t at this time of day attempt to tell you it contains luckily for that s the mercy everything but blindness i mean on their part the blindness said fanny is primarily her husband s he stood for a moment he would have it straight whose husband s mr verver s she went on the blindness is most of all his that they feel that they see but it s also his wife s whose wife s he asked as she continued to gloom at him in a manner at variance with the comparative cheer of her contention and then as she only gloomed the prince s maggie s own maggie s very own she pursued as for herself he had a pause do you think maggie so blind the question isn t of what i think the question s of the conviction that guides the prince and charlotte who have better opportunities than i for judging the colonel again wondered are you so very sure their opportunities are better well his wife asked what is their whole so extraordinary situation their extraordinary relation but an opportunity ah my dear you have that opportunity of their extraordinary situation and relation as much as they with the difference darling she returned with some spirit that neither of those matters are if you please mine i see the boat they re in but i m not thank god in it myself to day however mrs assingham added to day in eaton square i did see well then what but she mused over it still oh many things more somehow than ever before it was as if god help me i was seeing for them i mean for the others it was as if something had happened i don t know what except some effect of these days with them at that place that had either made things come out or had cleared my own eyes these eyes indeed of the poor lady s rested on her companion s meanwhile with the lustre not so much of intenser insight as of a particular portent that he had at various other times had occasion to recognise she desired obviously to reassure him but it apparently took a couple of large candid gathering glittering tears to emphasise the fact they had immediately for him their usual direct action she must reassure him he was made to feel absolutely in her own way he would adopt it and conform to it as soon as he should be able to make it out the only thing was that it took such incalculable twists and turns the twist seemed remarkable for instance as she developed her indication of what had come out in the afternoon it was as if i knew better than ever what makes them what makes them he pressed her as she fitfully dropped well makes the prince and charlotte take it all as they do it might well have been difficult to know how to take it and they may even say for themselves that they were a long time trying to see as i say to day she went on it was as if i were suddenly with a kind of horrible push seeing through their eyes on which as to shake off her perversity fanny assingham sprang up but she remained there under the dim illumination and while the colonel with his high dry spare look of type to which a certain conformity to the whiteness of inaccessible snows in his necktie shirt front and waistcoat gave a rigour of accent waited watching her they might at the late hour and in the still house have been a pair of specious worldly adventurers driven for relief under sudden stress to some grim midnight reckoning in an odd corner her attention moved mechanically over the objects of ornament disposed too freely on the walls of staircase and landing as to which recognition for the time had lost both fondness and compunction i can imagine the way it works she said it s so easy to understand yet i don t want to be wrong she the next moment broke out i don t i don t want to be wrong to make a mistake you mean oh no she meant nothing of the sort she knew but too well what she meant i don t make mistakes but i perpetrate in thought crimes and she spoke with all intensity i m a most dreadful person there are times when i seem not to mind a bit what i ve done or what i think or imagine or fear or accept when i feel that i d do it again feel that i d do things myself ah my dear the colonel remarked in the coolness of debate yes if you had driven me back on my nature luckily for you you never have you ve done every thing else but you ve never done that but what i really don t a bit want she declared is to abet them or to protect them her companion turned this over what is there to protect them from if by your now so settled faith they ve done nothing that justly exposes them and it in fact half pulled her up well from a sudden scare from the alarm i mean of what maggie may think yet if your whole idea is that maggie thinks nothing she waited again it isn t my whole idea nothing is my whole idea for i felt to day as i tell you that there s so much in the air oh in the air the colonel dryly breathed well what s in the air always has hasn t it to come down to the earth and maggie mrs assingham continued is a very curious little person since i was in this afternoon for seeing more than i had ever done well i felt that too for some reason as i hadn t yet felt it for some reason for what reason and then as his wife at first said nothing did she give any sign was she in any way different she s always so different from anyone else in the world that it s hard to say when she s different from herself but she has made me said fanny after an instant think of her differently she drove me home home here first to portland place on her leaving her father since she does once in a while leave him that was to keep me with her a little longer but she kept the carriage and after tea there came with me herself back here this was also for the same purpose then she went home though i had brought her a message from the prince that arranged their movements otherwise he and charlotte must have arrived if they have arrived expecting to drive together to eaton square and keep maggie on to dinner there she has everything there you know she has clothes the colonel didn t in fact know but he gave it his apprehension oh you mean a change twenty changes if you like all sorts of things she dresses really maggie does as much for her father and she always did as for her husband or for herself she has her room in his house very much as she had it before she was married and just as the boy has quite a second nursery there in which mrs noble when she comes with him makes herself i assure you at home si bien that if charlotte in her own house so to speak should wish a friend or two to stay with her she really would be scarce able to put them up it was a picture into which as a thrifty entertainer himself bob assingham could more or less enter maggie and the child spread so maggie and the child spread so well he considered it is rather rum that s all i claim she seemed thankful for the word i don t say it s anything more but it is distinctly rum which after an instant the colonel took up more what more could it be it could be that she s unhappy and that she takes her funny little way of consoling herself for if she were unhappy mrs assingham had figured it out that s just the way i m convinced she would take but how can she be unhappy since as i m also convinced she in the midst of everything adores her husband as much as ever the colonel at this brooded for a little at large then if she s so happy please what s the matter it made his wife almost spring at him you think then she s secretly wretched but he threw up his arms in deprecation ah my dear i give them up to you i ve nothing more to suggest then it s not sweet of you she spoke at present as if he were frequently sweet you admit that it is rum and this indeed fixed again for a moment his intention has charlotte complained of the want of rooms for her friends never that i know of a word it isn t the sort of thing she does and whom has she after all mrs assingham added to complain to hasn t she always you oh me charlotte and i nowadays she spoke as of a chapter closed yet see the justice i still do her she strikes me more and more as extraordinary a deeper shade at the renewal of the word had come into the colonel s face if they re each and all so extraordinary then isn t that why one must just resign one s self to wash one s hands of them to be lost her face however so met the question as if it were but a flicker of the old tone that their trouble had now become too real for her charged eyes so betrayed the condition of her nerves that he stepped back alertly enough to firmer ground he had spoken before in this light of a plain man s vision but he must be something more than a plain man now hasn t she then charlotte always her husband to complain to she d rather die oh and bob assingham s face at the vision of such extremities lengthened for very docility hasn t she the prince then for such matters oh he doesn t count i thought that was just what as the basis of our agitation he does do mrs assingham however had her distinction ready not a bit as a person to bore with complaints the ground of my agitation is exactly that she never on any pretext bores him not charlotte and in the imagination of mrs verver s superiority to any such mistake she gave characteristically something like a toss of her head as marked a tribute to that lady s general grace in all the conditions as the personage referred to doubtless had ever received ah only maggie with which the colonel gave a short low gurgle but it found his wife again prepared no not only maggie a great many people in london and small wonder bore him maggie only worst then but it was a question that he had promptly dropped at the returning brush of another of which she had shortly before sown the seed you said just now that he would by this time be back with charlotte if they have arrived you think it then possible that they really won t have returned his companion exhibited to view for the idea a sense of her responsibility but this was insufficient clearly to keep her from entertaining it i think there s nothing they re not now capable of in their so intense good faith good faith he echoed the words which had in fact something of an odd ring critically their false position it comes to the same thing and she bore down with her decision the superficial lack of sequence they may very possibly for a demonstration as i see them not have come back he wondered visibly at this how she did see them may have bolted somewhere together may have stayed over at matcham itself till tomorrow may have wired home each of them since maggie left me may have done fanny assingham continued god knows what she went on suddenly with more emotion which at the pressure of some spring of her inner vision broke out in a wail of distress imperfectly smothered whatever they ve done i shall never know never never because i don t want to and because nothing will induce me so they may do as they like but i ve worked for them all she uttered this last with another irrepressible quaver and the next moment her tears had come though she had with the explosion quitted her husband as if to hide it from him she passed into the dusky drawing room where during his own prowl shortly previous he had drawn up a blind so that the light of the street lamps came in a little at the window she made for this window against which she leaned her head while the colonel with his lengthened face looked after her for a minute and hesitated he might have been wondering what she had really done to what extent beyond his knowledge or his conception in the affairs of these people she could have committed herself but to hear her cry and yet try not to was quickly enough too much for him he had known her at other times quite not try not to and that had not been so bad he went to her and put his arm round her he drew her head to his breast where while she gasped she let it stay a little all with a patience that presently stilled her yet the effect of this small crisis oddly enough was not to close their colloquy with the natural result of sending them to bed what was between them had opened out further had somehow through the sharp show of her feeling taken a positive stride had entered as it were without more words the region of the understood shutting the door after it and bringing them so still more nearly face to face they remained for some minutes looking at it through the dim window which opened upon the world of human trouble in general and which let the vague light play here and there upon gilt and crystal and colour the florid features looming dimly of fanny s drawing room and the beauty of what thus passed between them passed with her cry of pain with her burst of tears with his wonderment and his kindness and his comfort with the moments of their silence above all which might have represented their sinking together hand in hand for a time into the mystic lake where he had begun as we have hinted by seeing her paddle alone the beauty of it was that they now could really talk better than before because the basis had at last once for all defined itself what was the basis which fanny absolutely exacted but that charlotte and the prince must be saved so far as consistently speaking of them as still safe might save them it did save them somehow for fanny s troubled mind for that was the nature of the mind of women he conveyed to her now at all events by refusing her no gentleness that he had sufficiently got the tip and that the tip was all he had wanted this remained quite clear even when he presently reverted to what she had told him of her recent passage with maggie i don t altogether see you know what you infer from it or why you infer anything when he so expressed himself it was quite as if in possession of what they had brought up from the depths xxiv i can t say more this made his companion reply than that something in her face her voice and her whole manner acted upon me as nothing in her had ever acted before and just for the reason above all that i felt her trying her very best and her very best poor duck is very good to be quiet and natural it s when one sees people who always are natural making little pale pathetic blinking efforts for it then it is that one knows something s the matter i can t describe my impression you would have had it for yourself and the only thing that ever can be the matter with maggie is that by that i mean her beginning to doubt to doubt for the first time mrs assingham wound up of her wonderful little judgment of her wonderful little world it was impressive fanny s vision and the colonel as if himself agitated by it took another turn of prowling to doubt of fidelity to doubt of friendship poor duck indeed it will go hard with her but she ll put it all he concluded on charlotte mrs assingham still darkly contemplative denied this with a headshake she won t put it anywhere she won t do with it anything anyone else would she ll take it all herself you mean she ll make it out her own fault yes she ll find means somehow to arrive at that ah then the colonel dutifully declared she s indeed a little brick oh his wife returned you ll see in one way or another to what tune and she spoke of a sudden with an approach to elation so that as if immediately feeling his surprise she turned round to him she ll see me somehow through see you yes me i m the worst for said fanny assingham now with a harder exaltation i did it all i recognise that i accept it she won t cast it up at me she won t cast up anything so i throw myself upon her she ll bear me up she spoke almost volubly she held him with her sudden sharpness she ll carry the whole weight of us there was still nevertheless wonder in it you mean she won t mind i say love and he not unkindly stared then where s the difficulty there isn t any fanny declared with the same rich emphasis it kept him indeed as by the loss of the thread looking at her longer ah you mean there isn t any for us she met his look for a minute as if it perhaps a little too much imputed a selfishness a concern at any cost for their own surface then she might have been deciding that their own surface was after all what they had most to consider not she said with dignity if we properly keep our heads she appeared even to signify that they would begin by keeping them now this was what it was to have at last a constituted basis do you remember what you said to me that night of my first real anxiety after the foreign office party in the carriage as we came home yes he could recall it leave them to pull through precisely trust their own wit you practically said to save all appearances well i ve trusted it i have left them to pull through he hesitated and your point is that they re not doing so i ve left them she went on but now i see how and where i ve been leaving them all the while without knowing it to her to the princess and that s what i mean mrs assingham pensively pursued that s what happened to me with her to day she continued to explain it came home to me that that s what i ve really been doing oh i see i needn t torment myself she has taken them over the colonel declared that he saw yet it was as if at this he a little sightlessly stared but what then has happened from one day to the other to her what has opened her eyes they were never really shut she misses him then why hasn t she missed him before well facing him there among their domestic glooms and glints fanny worked it out she did but she wouldn t let herself know it she had her reason she wore her blind now at last her situation has come to a head to day she does know it and that s illuminating it has been mrs assingham wound up illuminating to me her husband attended but the momentary effect of his attention was vagueness again and the refuge of his vagueness was a gasp poor dear little girl ah no don t pity her this did however pull him up we mayn t even be sorry for her not now or at least not yet it s too soon that is if it isn t very much too late this will depend mrs assingham went on at any rate we shall see we might have pitied her before for all the good it would then have done her we might have begun some time ago now however she has begun to live and the way it comes to me the way it comes to me but again she projected her vision the way it comes to you can scarcely be that she ll like it the way it comes to me is that she will live the way it comes to me is that she ll triumph she said this with so sudden a prophetic flare that it fairly cheered her husband ah then we must back her no we mustn t touch her we mayn t touch any of them we must keep our hands off we must go on tiptoe we must simply watch and wait and meanwhile said mrs assingham we must bear it as we can that s where we are and serves us right we re in presence and so moving about the room as in communion with shadowy portents she left it till he questioned again in presence of what well of something possibly beautiful beautiful as it may come off she had paused there before him while he wondered you mean she ll get the prince back she raised her hand in quick impatience the suggestion might have been almost abject it isn t a question of recovery it won t be a question of any vulgar struggle to get him back she must have lost him and to have lost him she must have had him with which fanny shook her head what i take her to be waking up to is the truth that all the while she really hasn t had him never ah my dear the poor colonel panted never his wife repeated and she went on without pity do you remember what i said to you long ago that evening just before their marriage when charlotte had so suddenly turned up the smile with which he met this appeal was not it was to be feared robust what haven t you love said in your time so many things no doubt that they make a chance for my having once or twice spoken the truth i never spoke it more at all events than when i put it to you that evening that maggie was the person in the world to whom a wrong thing could least be communicated it was as if her imagination had been closed to it her sense altogether sealed that therefore fanny continued is what will now have to happen her sense will have to open i see he nodded to the wrong he nodded again almost cheerfully as if he had been keeping the peace with a baby or a lunatic to the very very wrong but his wife s spirit after its effort of wing was able to remain higher to what s called evil with a very big e for the first time in her life to the discovery of it to the knowledge of it to the crude experience of it and she gave for the possibility the largest measure to the harsh bewildering brush the daily chilling breath of it unless indeed and here mrs assingham noted a limit unless indeed as yet so far as she has come and if she comes no further simply to the suspicion and the dread what we shall see is whether that mere dose of alarm will prove enough he considered but enough for what then dear if not enough to break her heart enough to give her a shaking mrs assingham rather oddly replied to give her i mean the right one the right one won t break her heart it will make her she explained well it will make her by way of a change understand one or two things in the world but isn t it a pity the colonel asked that they should happen to be the one or two that will be the most disagreeable to her oh disagreeable they ll have had to be disagreeable to show her a little where she is they ll have had to be disagreeable to make her sit up they ll have had to be disagreeable to make her decide to live bob assingham was now at the window while his companion slowly revolved he had lighted a cigarette for final patience and he seemed vaguely to time her as she moved to and fro he had at the same time to do justice to the lucidity she had at last attained and it was doubtless by way of expression of this teachability that he let his eyes for a minute roll as from the force of feeling over the upper dusk of the room he had thought of the response his wife s words ideally implied decide to live ah yes for her child oh bother her child and he had never felt so snubbed for an exemplary view as when fanny now stopped short to live you poor dear for her father which is another pair of sleeves and mrs assingham s whole ample ornamented person irradiated with this the truth that had begun under so much handling to glow any idiot can do things for her child she ll have a motive more original and we shall see how it will work her she ll have to save him to save him to keep her father from her own knowledge that and she seemed to see it before her in her husband s very eyes will be work cut out with which as at the highest conceivable climax she wound up their colloquy good night there was something in her manner however or in the effect at least of this supreme demonstration that had fairly and by a single touch lifted him to her side so that after she had turned her back to regain the landing and the staircase he overtook her before she had begun to mount with the ring of excited perception ah but you know that s rather jolly jolly she turned upon it again at the foot of the staircase i mean it s rather charming charming it had still to be their law a little that she was tragic when he was comic i mean it s rather beautiful you just said yourself it would be only he pursued promptly with the impetus of this idea and as if it had suddenly touched with light for him connections hitherto dim only i don t quite see why that very care for him which has carried her to such other lengths precisely as affect one as so rum hasn t also by the same stroke made her notice a little more what has been going on ah there you are it s the question that i ve all along been asking myself she had rested her eyes on the carpet but she raised them as she pursued she let him have it straight and it s the question of an idiot an idiot well the idiot that i ve been in all sorts of ways so often of late have i asked it you re excusable since you ask it but now the answer i saw to day has all the while been staring me in the face then what in the world is it why the very intensity of her conscience about him the very passion of her brave little piety that s the way it has worked mrs assingham explained and i admit it to have been as rum a way as possible but it has been working from a rum start from the moment the dear man married to ease his daughter off and it then happened by an extraordinary perversity that the very opposite effect was produced with the renewed vision of this fatality however she could give but a desperate shrug i see the colonel sympathetically mused that was a rum start but his very response as she again flung up her arms seemed to make her sense for a moment intolerable yes there i am i was really at the bottom of it she declared i don t know what possessed me but i planned for him i goaded him on with which however the next moment she took herself up or rather i do know what possessed me for wasn t he beset with ravening women right and left and didn t he quite pathetically appeal for protection didn t he quite charmingly show one how he needed and desired it maggie she thus lucidly continued couldn t with a new life of her own give herself up to doing for him in the future all she had done in the past to fencing him in to keeping him safe and keeping them off one perceived this she went on out of the abundance of one s affection and one s sympathy it all blessedly came back to her when it wasn t all for the fiftieth time obscured in face of the present facts by anxiety and compunction one was no doubt a meddlesome fool one always is to think one sees people s lives for them better than they see them for themselves but one s excuse here she insisted was that these people clearly didn t see them for themselves didn t see them at all it struck one for very pity that they were making a mess of such charming material that they were but wasting it and letting it go they didn t know how to live and somehow one couldn t if one took an interest in them at all simply stand and see it that s what i pay for and the poor woman in straighter communion with her companion s intelligence at this moment she appeared to feel than she had ever been before let him have the whole of the burden of her consciousness i always pay for it sooner or later my sociable my damnable my unnecessary interest nothing of course would suit me but that it should fix itself also on charlotte charlotte who was hovering there on the edge of our lives when not beautifully and a trifle mysteriously flitting across them and who was a piece of waste and a piece of threatened failure just as for any possible good to the world mr verver and maggie were it began to come over me in the watches of the night that charlotte was a person who could keep off ravening women without being one herself either in the vulgar way of the others and that this service to mr verver would be a sweet employment for her future there was something of course that might have stopped me you know you know what i mean it looks at me she veritably moaned out of your face but all i can say is that it didn t the reason largely being once i had fallen in love with the beautiful symmetry of my plan that i seemed to feel sure maggie would accept charlotte whereas i didn t quite make out either what other woman or what other kind of woman one could think of her accepting i see i see she had paused meeting all the while his listening look and the fever of her retrospect had so risen with her talk that the desire was visibly strong in him to meet her on his side but with cooling breath one quite understands my dear it only however kept her there sombre i naturally see love what you understand which sits again perfectly in your eyes you see that i saw that maggie would accept her in helpless ignorance yes dearest and the grimness of her dreariness suddenly once more possessed her you ve only to tell me that that knowledge was my reason for what i did how when you do can i stand up to you you see she said with an ineffable headshake that i don t stand up i m down down down she declared yet she as quickly added there s just one little thing that helps to save my life and she kept him waiting but an instant they might easily they would perhaps even certainly have done something worse he thought worse than that charlotte ah don t tell me she cried that there could have been nothing worse there might as they were have been many things charlotte in her way is extraordinary he was almost simultaneous extraordinary she observes the forms said fanny assingham he hesitated with the prince for the prince and with the others she went on with mr verver wonderfully but above all with maggie and the forms she had to do even them justice are two thirds of conduct say he had married a woman who would have made a hash of them but he jerked back ah my dear i wouldn t say it for the world say she none the less pursued he had married a woman the prince would really have cared for you mean then he doesn t care for charlotte this was still a new view to jump to and the colonel perceptibly wished to make sure of the necessity of the effort for that while he stared his wife allowed him time at the end of which she simply said no then what on earth are they up to still however she only looked at him so that standing there before her with his hands in his pockets he had time further to risk soothingly another question are the forms you speak of that are two thirds of conduct what will be keeping her now by your hypothesis from coming home with him till morning yes absolutely their forms theirs maggie s and mr verver s those they impose on charlotte and the prince those she developed that so perversely as i say have succeeded in setting themselves up as the right ones he considered but only now at last really to relapse into woe your perversity my dear is exactly what i don t understand the state of things existing hasn t grown like a field of mushrooms in a night whatever they all round may be in for now is at least the consequence of what they ve done are they mere helpless victims of fate well fanny at last had the courage of it yes they are to be so abjectly innocent that is to be victims of fate and charlotte and the prince are abjectly innocent it took her another minute but she rose to the full height yes that is they were as much so in their way as the others there were beautiful intentions all round the prince s and charlotte s were beautiful of that i had my faith they were i d go to the stake otherwise she added i should have been a wretch and i ve not been a wretch i ve only been a double dyed donkey ah then he asked what does our muddle make them to have been well too much taken up with considering each other you may call such a mistake as that by what ever name you please it at any rate means all round their case it illustrates the misfortune said mrs assingham gravely of being too too charming this was another matter that took some following but the colonel again did his best yes but to whom doesn t it rather depend on that to whom have the prince and charlotte then been too charming to each other in the first place obviously and then both of them together to maggie to maggie he wonderingly echoed to maggie she was now crystalline by having accepted from the first so guilelessly yes so guilelessly themselves her guileless idea of still having her father of keeping him fast in her life then isn t one supposed in common humanity and if one hasn t quarrelled with him and one has the means and he on his side doesn t drink or kick up rows isn t one supposed to keep one s aged parent in one s life certainly when there aren t particular reasons against it that there may be others than his getting drunk is exactly the moral of what is before us in the first place mr verver isn t aged the colonel just hung fire but it came then why the deuce does he oh poor dear man behave as if he were she took a moment to meet it how do you know how he behaves well my own love we see how charlotte does again at this she faltered but again she rose ah isn t my whole point that he s charming to her doesn t it depend a bit on what she regards as charming she faced the question as if it were flippant then with a headshake of dignity she brushed it away it s mr verver who s really young it s charlotte who s really old and what i was saying she added isn t affected you were saying he did her the justice that they re all guileless that they were guileless all at first quite extraordinarily it s what i mean by their failure to see that the more they took for granted they could work together the more they were really working apart for i repeat fanny went on that i really believe charlotte and the prince honestly to have made up their minds originally that their very esteem for mr verver which was serious as well it might be would save them i see the colonel inclined himself and save him it comes to the same thing then save maggie that comes said mrs assingham to something a little different for maggie has done the most he wondered what do you call the most well she did it originally she began the vicious circle for that though you make round eyes at my associating her with vice is simply what it has been it s their mutual consideration all round that has made it the bottomless gulf and they re really so embroiled but because in their way they ve been so improbably good in their way yes the colonel grinned which was above all maggie s way no flicker of his ribaldry was anything to her now maggie had in the first place to make up to her father for her having suffered herself to become poor little dear as she believed so intensely married then she had to make up to her husband for taking so much of the time they might otherwise have spent together to make this reparation to mr verver perfect and her way to do this precisely was by allowing the prince the use the enjoyment whatever you may call it of charlotte to cheer his path by instalments as it were in proportion as she herself making sure her father was all right might be missed from his side by so much at the same time however mrs assingham further explained by so much as she took her young stepmother for this purpose away from mr verver by just so much did this too strike her as something again to be made up for it has saddled her you will easily see with a positively new obligation to her father an obligation created and aggravated by her unfortunate even if quite heroic little sense of justice she began with wanting to show him that his marriage could never under whatever temptation of her own bliss with the prince become for her a pretext for deserting or neglecting him then that in its order entailed her wanting to show the prince that she recognised how the other desire this wish to remain intensely the same passionate little daughter she had always been involved in some degree and just for the present so to speak her neglecting and deserting him i quite hold fanny with characteristic amplitude parenthesised that a person can mostly feel but one passion one tender passion that is at a time only that doesn t hold good for our primary and instinctive attachments the voice of blood such as one s feeling for a parent or a brother those may be intense and yet not prevent other intensities as you will recognise my dear when you remember how i continued tout betement to adore my mother whom you didn t adore for years after i had begun to adore you well maggie she kept it up is in the same situation as i was plus complications from which i was thank heaven exempt plus the complication above all of not having in the least begun with the sense for complications that i should have had before she knew it at any rate her little scruples and her little lucidities which were really so divinely blind her feverish little sense of justice as i say had brought the two others together as her grossest misconduct couldn t have done and now she knows something or other has happened yet hasn t heretofore known what she has only piled up her remedy poor child something that she has earnestly but confusedly seen as her necessary policy piled it on top of the policy on top of the remedy that she at first thought out for herself and that would really have needed since then so much modification her only modification has been the growth of her necessity to prevent her father s wondering if all in their life in common may be so certainly for the best she has now as never before to keep him unconscious that peculiar if he makes a point of it as their situation is there s anything in it all uncomfortable or disagreeable anything morally the least out of the way she has to keep touching it up to make it each day each month look natural and normal to him so that god forgive me the comparison she s like an old woman who has taken to painting and who has to lay it on thicker to carry it off with a greater audacity with a greater impudence even the older she grows and fanny stood a moment captivated with the image she had thrown off i like the idea of maggie audacious and impudent learning to be so to gloss things over she could she even will yet i believe learn it for that sacred purpose consummately diabolically for from the moment the dear man should see it s all rouge she paused staring at the vision it imparted itself even to bob then the fun would begin as it but made her look at him hard however he amended the form of his inquiry you mean that in that case she will charming creature be lost she was silent a moment more as i ve told you before she won t be lost if her father s saved she ll see that as salvation enough the colonel took it in then she s a little heroine rather she s a little heroine but it s his innocence above all mrs assingham added that will pull them through her companion at this focussed again mr verver s innocence it s awfully quaint of course it s awfully quaint that it s awfully quaint that the pair are awfully quaint quaint with all our dear old quaintness by which i don t mean yours and mine but that of my own sweet countrypeople from whom i ve so deplorably degenerated that mrs assingham declared was originally the head and front of their appeal to me and of my interest in them and of course i shall feel them quainter still she rather ruefully subjoined before they ve done with me this might be but it wasn t what most stood in the colonel s way you believe so in mr verver s innocence after two years of charlotte she stared but the whole point is just that two years of charlotte are what he hasn t really or what you may call undividedly had any more than maggie by your theory eh has really or undividedly had four of the prince it takes all she hasn t had the colonel conceded to account for the innocence that in her too so leaves us in admiration so far as it might be ribald again she let this pass it takes a great many things to account for maggie what is definite at all events is that strange though this be her effort for her father has up to now sufficiently succeeded she has made him she makes him accept the tolerably obvious oddity of their relation all round for part of the game behind her there protected and amused and as it were exquisitely humbugged the principino in whom he delights always aiding he has safely and serenely enough suffered the conditions of his life to pass for those he had sublimely projected he hadn t worked them out in detail any more than i had heaven pity me and the queerness has been exactly in the detail this for him is what it was to have married charlotte and they both she neatly wound up help both i mean that if maggie always in the breach makes it seem to him all so flourishingly to fit charlotte does her part not less and her part is very large charlotte fanny declared works like a horse so there it all was and her husband looked at her a minute across it and what does the prince work like she fixed him in return like a prince whereupon breaking short off to ascend to her room she presented her highly decorated back in which in odd places controlling the complications of its aspect the ruby or the garnet the turquoise and the topaz gleamed like faint symbols of the wit that pinned together the satin patches of her argument he watched her as if she left him positively under the impression of her mastery of her subject yes as if the real upshot of the drama before them was but that he had when it came to the tight places of life as life had shrunk for him now the most luminous of wives he turned off in this view of her majestic retreat the comparatively faint little electric lamp which had presided over their talk then he went up as immediately behind her as the billows of her amber train allowed making out how all the clearness they had conquered was even for herself a relief how at last the sense of the amplitude of her exposition sustained and floated her joining her however on the landing above where she had already touched a metallic point into light he found she had done perhaps even more to create than to extinguish in him the germ of a curiosity he held her a minute longer there was another plum in the pie what did you mean some minutes ago by his not caring for charlotte the prince s by his not really caring she recalled after a little benevolently enough i mean that men don t when it has all been too easy that s how in nine cases out of ten a woman is treated who has risked her life you asked me just now how he works she added but you might better perhaps have asked me how he plays well he made it up like a prince like a prince he is profoundly a prince for that she said with expression he s beautifully a case they re far rarer even in the highest circles than they pretend to be and that s what makes so much of his value he s perhaps one of the very last the last of the real ones so it is we must take him we must take him all round the colonel considered and how must charlotte if anything happens take him the question held her a minute and while she waited with her eyes on him she put out a grasping hand to his arm in the flesh of which he felt her answer distinctly enough registered thus she gave him standing off a little the firmest longest deepest injunction he had ever received from her nothing in spite of everything will happen nothing has happened nothing is happening he looked a trifle disappointed i see for us for us for whom else and he was to feel indeed how she wished him to understand it we know nothing on earth it was an undertaking he must sign so he wrote as it were his name we know nothing on earth it was like the soldiers watchword at night we re as innocent she went on in the same way as babes why not rather say he asked as innocent as they themselves are oh for the best of reasons because we re much more so he wondered but how can we be more for them oh easily we can be anything absolute idiots then absolute idiots and oh fanny breathed the way it will rest us well he looked as if there were something in that but won t they know we re not she barely hesitated charlotte and the prince think we are which is so much gained mr verver believes in our intelligence but he doesn t matter and maggie doesn t she know that we see before our noses yes this indeed took longer oh so far as she may guess it she ll give no sign so it comes to the same thing he raised his eyebrows comes to our not being able to help her that s the way we shall help her by looking like fools she threw up her hands she only wants herself to look like a bigger so there we are with which she brushed it away his conformity was promised something however still held her it broke to her own vision as a last wave of clearness moreover now she said i see i mean she added what you were asking me how i knew to day in eaton square that maggie s awake and she had indeed visibly got it it was by seeing them together seeing her with her father he fell behind again but you ve seen her often enough before never with my present eyes for nothing like such a test that of this length of the others absence together has hitherto occurred possibly but if she and mr verver insisted upon it why is it such a test because it has become one without their intending it it has spoiled so to speak on their hands it has soured eh the colonel said the word s horrible say rather it has changed perhaps fanny went on she did wish to see how much she can bear in that case she has seen only it was she alone who about the visit insisted her father insists on nothing and she watches him do it her husband looked impressed watches him for the first faint sign i mean of his noticing it doesn t as i tell you come but she s there for it to see and i felt she continued how she s there i caught her as it were in the fact she couldn t keep it from me though she left her post on purpose came home with me to throw dust in my eyes i took it all her dust but it was what showed me with which supreme lucidity she reached the door of her room luckily it showed me also how she has succeeded nothing from him has come you re so awfully sure sure nothing will good night she said she ll die first the golden bowl volume ii book second the princess part fourth xxv it was not till many days had passed that the princess began to accept the idea of having done a little something she was not always doing or indeed that of having listened to any inward voice that spoke in a new tone yet these instinctive postponements of reflection were the fruit positively of recognitions and perceptions already active of the sense above all that she had made at a particular hour made by the mere touch of her hand a difference in the situation so long present to her as practically unattackable this situation had been occupying for months and months the very centre of the garden of her life but it had reared itself there like some strange tall tower of ivory or perhaps rather some wonderful beautiful but outlandish pagoda a structure plated with hard bright porcelain coloured and figured and adorned at the overhanging eaves with silver bells that tinkled ever so charmingly when stirred by chance airs she had walked round and round it that was what she felt she had carried on her existence in the space left her for circulation a space that sometimes seemed ample and sometimes narrow looking up all the while at the fair structure that spread itself so amply and rose so high but never quite making out as yet where she might have entered had she wished she had not wished till now such was the odd case and what was doubtless equally odd besides was that though her raised eyes seemed to distinguish places that must serve from within and especially far aloft as apertures and outlooks no door appeared to give access from her convenient garden level the great decorated surface had remained consistently impenetrable and inscrutable at present however to her considering mind it was as if she had ceased merely to circle and to scan the elevation ceased so vaguely so quite helplessly to stare and wonder she had caught herself distinctly in the act of pausing then in that of lingering and finally in that of stepping unprecedentedly near the thing might have been by the distance at which it kept her a mahometan mosque with which no base heretic could take a liberty there so hung about it the vision of one s putting off one s shoes to enter and even verily of one s paying with one s life if found there as an interloper she had not certainly arrived at the conception of paying with her life for anything she might do but it was nevertheless quite as if she had sounded with a tap or two one of the rare porcelain plates she had knocked in short though she could scarce have said whether for admission or for what she had applied her hand to a cool smooth spot and had waited to see what would happen something had happened it was as if a sound at her touch after a little had come back to her from within a sound sufficiently suggesting that her approach had been noted if this image however may represent our young woman s consciousness of a recent change in her life a change now but a few days old it must at the same time be observed that she both sought and found in renewed circulation as i have called it a measure of relief from the idea of having perhaps to answer for what she had done the pagoda in her blooming garden figured the arrangement how otherwise was it to be named by which so strikingly she had been able to marry without breaking as she liked to put it with the past she had surrendered herself to her husband without the shadow of a reserve or a condition and yet she had not all the while given up her father the least little inch she had compassed the high city of seeing the two men beautifully take to each other and nothing in her marriage had marked it as more happy than this fact of its having practically given the elder the lonelier a new friend what had moreover all the while enriched the whole aspect of success was that the latter s marriage had been no more meassurably paid for than her own his having taken the same great step in the same free way had not in the least involved the relegation of his daughter that it was remarkable they should have been able at once so to separate and so to keep together had never for a moment from however far back been equivocal to her that it was remarkable had in fact quite counted at first and always and for each of them equally as part of their inspiration and their support there were plenty of singular things they were not enamoured of flights of brilliancy of audacity of originality that speaking at least for the dear man and herself were not at all in their line but they liked to think they had given their life this unusual extension and this liberal form which many families many couples and still more many pairs of couples would not have found workable that last truth had been distinctly brought home to them by the bright testimony the quite explicit envy of most of their friends who had remarked to them again and again that they must on all the showing to keep on such terms be people of the highest amiability equally including in the praise of course amerigo and charlotte it had given them pleasure as how should it not to find themselves shed such a glamour it had certainly that is given pleasure to her father and herself both of them distinguishably of a nature so slow to presume that they would scarce have been sure of their triumph without this pretty reflection of it so it was that their felicity had fructified so it was that the ivory tower visible and admirable doubtless from any point of the social field had risen stage by stage maggie s actual reluctance to ask herself with proportionate sharpness why she had ceased to take comfort in the sight of it represented accordingly a lapse from that ideal consistency on which her moral comfort almost at any time depended to remain consistent she had always been capable of cutting down more or less her prior term moving for the first time in her life as in the darkening shadow of a false position she reflected that she should either not have ceased to be right that is to be confident or have recognised that she was wrong though she tried to deal with herself for a space only as a silken coated spaniel who has scrambled out of a pond and who rattles the water from his ears her shake of her head again and again as she went was much of that order and she had the resource to which save for the rude equivalent of his generalising bark the spaniel would have been a stranger of humming to herself hard as a sign that nothing had happened to her she had not so to speak fallen in she had had no accident and had not got wet this at any rate was her pretension until after she began a little to wonder if she mightn t with or without exposure have taken cold she could at all events remember no time at which she had felt so excited and certainly none which was another special point that so brought with it as well the necessity for concealing excitement this birth of a new eagerness became a high pastime in her view precisely by reason of the ingenuity required for keeping the thing born out of sight the ingenuity was thus a private and absorbing exercise in the light of which might i so far multiply my metaphors i should compare her to the frightened but clinging young mother of an unlawful child the idea that had possession of her would be by our new analogy the proof of her misadventure but likewise all the while only another sign of a relation that was more to her than anything on earth she had lived long enough to make out for herself that any deep seated passion has its pangs as well as its joys and that we are made by its aches and its anxieties most richly conscious of it she had never doubted of the force of the feeling that bound her to her husband but to become aware almost suddenly that it had begun to vibrate with a violence that had some of the effect of a strain would rightly looked at after all but show that she was like thousands of women every day acting up to the full privilege of passion why in the world shouldn t she with every right if on consideration she saw no good reason against it the best reason against it would have been the possibility of some consequence disagreeable or inconvenient to others especially to such others as had never incommoded her by the egotism of their passions but if once that danger were duly guarded against the fulness of one s measure amounted to no more than the equal use of one s faculties or the proper playing of one s part it had come to the princess obscurely at first but little by little more conceivably that her faculties had not for a good while been concomitantly used the case resembled in a manner that of her once loved dancing a matter of remembered steps that had grown vague from her ceasing to go to balls she would go to balls again that seemed freely even crudely stated the remedy she would take out of the deep receptacles in which she had laid them away the various ornaments congruous with the greater occasions and of which her store she liked to think was none of the smallest she would have been easily to be figured for us at this occupation dipping at off moments and quiet hours in snatched visits and by draughty candle light into her rich collections and seeing her jewels again a little shyly but all unmistakably glow that in fact may pass as the very picture of her semi smothered agitation of the diversion she to some extent successfully found in referring her crisis so far as was possible to the mere working of her own needs it must be added however that she would have been at a loss to determine and certainly at first to which order that of self control or that of large expression the step she had taken the afternoon of her husband s return from matcham with his companion properly belonged for it had been a step distinctly on maggie s part her deciding to do something just then and there which would strike amerigo as unusual and this even though her departure from custom had merely consisted in her so arranging that he wouldn t find her as he would definitely expect to do in eaton square he would have strangely enough as might seem to him to come back home for it and there get the impression of her rather pointedly or at least all impatiently and independently awaiting him these were small variations and mild manoeuvres but they went accompanied on maggie s part as we have mentioned with an infinite sense of intention her watching by his fireside for her husband s return from an absence might superficially have presented itself as the most natural act in the world and the only one into the bargain on which he would positively have reckoned it fell by this circumstance into the order of plain matters and yet the very aspect by which it was in the event handed over to her brooding fancy was the fact that she had done with it all she had designed she had put her thought to the proof and the proof had shown its edge this was what was before her that she was no longer playing with blunt and idle tools with weapons that didn t cut there passed across her vision ten times a day the gleam of a bare blade and at this it was that she most shut her eyes most knew the impulse to cheat herself with motion and sound she had merely driven on a certain wednesday to portland place instead of remaining in eaton square and she privately repeated it again and again there had appeared beforehand no reason why she should have seen the mantle of history flung by a single sharp sweep over so commonplace a deed that all the same was what had happened it had been bitten into her mind all in an hour that nothing she had ever done would hereafter in some way yet to be determined so count for her perhaps not even what she had done in accepting in their old golden rome amerigo s proposal of marriage and yet by her little crouching posture there that of a timid tigress she had meant nothing recklessly ultimate nothing clumsily fundamental so that she called it names the invidious the grotesque attitude holding it up to her own ridicule reducing so far as she could the portee of what had followed it she had but wanted to get nearer nearer to something indeed that she couldn t that she wouldn t even to herself describe and the degree of this achieved nearness was what had been in advance incalculable her actual multiplication of distractions and suppressions whatever it did for her failed to prevent her living over again any chosen minute for she could choose them she could fix them of the freshness of relation produced by her having administered to her husband the first surprise to which she had ever treated him it had been a poor thing but it had been all her own and the whole passage was backwardly there a great picture hung on the wall of her daily life for her to make what she would of it fell for retrospect into a succession of moments that were watchable still almost in the manner of the different things done during a scene on the stage some scene so acted as to have left a great impression on the tenant of one of the stalls several of these moments stood out beyond the others and those she could feel again most count again like the firm pearls on a string had belonged more particularly to the lapse of time before dinner dinner which had been so late quite at nine o clock that evening thanks to the final lateness of amerigo s own advent these were parts of the experience though in fact there had been a good many of them between which her impression could continue sharply to discriminate before the subsequent passages much later on it was to be said the flame of memory turned to an equalising glow that of a lamp in some side chapel in which incense was thick the great moment at any rate for conscious repossession was doubtless the first the strange little timed silence which she had fully gauged on the spot as altogether beyond her own intention but which for just how long should she ever really know for just how long she could do nothing to break she was in the smaller drawing room in which she always sat and she had by calculation dressed for dinner on finally coming in it was a wonder how many things she had calculated in respect to this small incident a matter for the importance of which she had so quite indefinite a measure he would be late he would be very late that was the one certainty that seemed to look her in the face there was still also the possibility that if he drove with charlotte straight to eaton square he might think it best to remain there even on learning she had come away she had left no message for him on any such chance this was another of her small shades of decision though the effect of it might be to keep him still longer absent he might suppose she would already have dined he might stay with all he would have to tell just on purpose to be nice to her father she had known him to stretch the point to these beautiful ends far beyond that he had more than once stretched it to the sacrifice of the opportunity of dressing if she herself had now avoided any such sacrifice and had made herself during the time at her disposal quite inordinately fresh and quite positively smart this had probably added while she waited and waited to that very tension of spirit in which she was afterwards to find the image of her having crouched she did her best quite intensely by herself to banish any such appearance she couldn t help it if she couldn t read her pale novel ah that par exemple was beyond her but she could at least sit by the lamp with the book sit there with her newest frock worn for the first time sticking out all round her quite stiff and grand even perhaps a little too stiff and too grand for a familiar and domestic frock yet marked none the less this time she ventured to hope by incontestable intrinsic merit she had glanced repeatedly at the clock but she had refused herself the weak indulgence of walking up and down though the act of doing so she knew would make her feel on the polished floor with the rustle and the hang still more beautifully bedecked the difficulty was that it would also make her feel herself still more sharply in a state which was exactly what she proposed not to do the only drops of her anxiety had been when her thought strayed complacently with her eyes to the front of her gown which was in a manner a refuge a beguilement especially when she was able to fix it long enough to wonder if it would at last really satisfy charlotte she had ever been in respect to her clothes rather timorous and uncertain for the last year above all she had lived in the light of charlotte s possible and rather inscrutable judgment of them charlotte s own were simply the most charming and interesting that any woman had ever put on there was a kind of poetic justice in her being at last able in this particular thanks to means thanks quite to omnipotence freely to exercise her genius but maggie would have described herself as in these connections constantly and intimately torn conscious on one side of the impossibility of copying her companion and conscious on the other of the impossibility of sounding her independently to the bottom yes it was one of the things she should go down to her grave without having known how charlotte after all had been said really thought her stepdaughter looked under any supposedly ingenious personal experiment she had always been lovely about the stepdaughter s material braveries had done for her the very best with them but there had ever fitfully danced at the back of maggie s head the suspicion that these expressions were mercies not judgments embodying no absolute but only a relative frankness hadn t charlotte with so perfect a critical vision if the truth were known given her up as hopeless hopeless by a serious standard and thereby invented for her a different and inferior one in which as the only thing to be done she patiently and soothingly abetted her hadn t she in other words assented in secret despair perhaps even in secret irritation to her being ridiculous so that the best now possible was to wonder once in a great while whether one mightn t give her the surprise of something a little less out of the true note than usual something of this kind was the question that maggie while the absentees still delayed asked of the appearance she was endeavouring to present but with the result repeatedly again that it only went and lost itself in the thick air that had begun more and more to hang for our young woman over her accumulations of the unanswered they were there these accumulations they were like a roomful of confused objects never as yet sorted which for some time now she had been passing and re passing along the corridor of her life she passed it when she could without opening the door then on occasion she turned the key to throw in a fresh contribution so it was that she had been getting things out of the way they rejoined the rest of the confusion it was as if they found their place by some instinct of affinity in the heap they knew in short where to go and when she at present by a mental act once more pushed the door open she had practically a sense of method and experience what she should never know about charlotte s thought she tossed that in it would find itself in company and she might at last have been standing there long enough to see it fall into its corner the sight moreover would doubtless have made her stare had her attention been more free the sight of the mass of vain things congruous incongruous that awaited every addition it made her in fact with a vague gasp turn away and what had further determined this was the final sharp extinction of the inward scene by the outward the quite different door had opened and her husband was there it had been as strange as she could consent afterwards to think it it had been essentially what had made the abrupt bend in her life he had come back had followed her from the other house visibly uncertain this was written in the face he for the first minute showed her it had been written only for those seconds and it had appeared to go quickly after they began to talk but while it lasted it had been written large and though she didn t quite know what she had expected of him she felt she hadn t expected the least shade of embarrassment what had made the embarrassment she called it embarrassment so as to be able to assure herself she put it at the very worst what had made the particular look was his thus distinguishably wishing to see how he should find her why first that had later on kept coming to her the question dangled there as if it were the key to everything with the sense of it on the spot she had felt overwhelmingly that she was significant that so she must instantly strike him and that this had a kind of violence beyond what she had intended it was in fact even at the moment not absent from her view that he might easily have made an abject fool of her at least for the time she had indeed for just ten seconds been afraid of some such turn the uncertainty in his face had become so the next thing an uncertainty in the very air three words of impatience the least bit loud some outbreak of what in the world are you up to and what do you mean any note of that sort would instantly have brought her low and this all the more that heaven knew she hadn t in any manner designed to be high it was such a trifle her small breach with custom or at any rate with his natural presumption that all magnitude of wonder had already had before one could deprecate the shadow of it the effect of a complication it had made for him some difference that she couldn t measure this meeting him at home and alone instead of elsewhere and with others and back and back it kept coming to her that the blankness he showed her before he was able to see might should she choose to insist on it have a meaning have as who should say an historic value beyond the importance of momentary expressions in general she had naturally had on the spot no ready notion of what he might want to see it was enough for a ready notion not to speak of a beating heart that he did see that he saw his wife in her own drawing room at the hour when she would most properly be there he hadn t in any way challenged her it was true and after those instants during which she now believed him to have been harbouring the impression of something unusually prepared and pointed in her attitude and array he had advanced upon her smiling and smiling and thus without hesitation at the last had taken her into his arms the hesitation had been at the first and she at present saw that he had surmounted it without her help she had given him no help for if on the one hand she couldn t speak for hesitation so on the other and especially as he didn t ask her she couldn t explain why she was agitated she had known it all the while down to her toes known it in his presence with fresh intensity and if he had uttered but a question it would have pressed in her the spring of recklessness it had been strange that the most natural thing of all to say to him should have had that appearance but she was more than ever conscious that any appearance she had would come round more or less straight to her father whose life was now so quiet on the basis accepted for it that any alteration of his consciousness even in the possible sense of enlivenment would make their precious equilibrium waver that was at the bottom of her mind that their equilibrium was everything and that it was practically precarious a matter of a hair s breadth for the loss of the balance it was the equilibrium or at all events her conscious fear about it that had brought her heart into her mouth and the same fear was on either side in the silent look she and amerigo had exchanged the happy balance that demanded this amount of consideration was truly thus as by its own confession a delicate matter but that her husband had also his habit of anxiety and his general caution only brought them after all more closely together it would have been most beautifully therefore in the name of the equilibrium and in that of her joy at their feeling so exactly the same about it that she might have spoken if she had permitted the truth on the subject of her behaviour to ring out on the subject of that poor little behaviour which was for the moment so very limited a case of eccentricity why why have i made this evening such a point of our not all dining together well because i ve all day been so wanting you alone that i finally couldn t bear it and that there didn t seem any great reason why i should try to that came to me funny as it may at first sound with all the things we ve so wonderfully got into the way of bearing for each other you ve seemed these last days i don t know what more absent than ever before too absent for us merely to go on so it s all very well and i perfectly see how beautiful it is all round but there comes a day when something snaps when the full cup filled to the very brim begins to flow over that s what has happened to my need of you the cup all day has been too full to carry so here i am with it spilling it over you and just for the reason that is the reason of my life after all i ve scarcely to explain that i m as much in love with you now as the first hour except that there are some hours which i know when they come because they almost frighten me that show me i m even more so they come of themselves and ah they ve been coming after all after all some such words as those were what didn t ring out yet it was as if even the unuttered sound had been quenched here in its own quaver it was where utterance would have broken down by its very weight if he had let it get so far without that extremity at the end of a moment he had taken in what he needed to take that his wife was testifying that she adored and missed and desired him after all after all since she put it so she was right that was what he had to respond to that was what from the moment that as has been said he saw he had to treat as the most pertinent thing possible he held her close and long in expression of their personal reunion this obviously was one way of doing so he rubbed his cheek tenderly and with a deep vague murmur against her face that side of her face she was not pressing to his breast that was not less obviously another way and there were ways enough in short for his extemporised ease for the good humour she was afterwards to find herself thinking of as his infinite tact this last was partly no doubt because the question of tact might be felt as having come up at the end of a quarter of an hour during which he had liberally talked and she had genially questioned he had told her of his day the happy thought of his roundabout journey with charlotte all their cathedral hunting adventure and how it had turned out rather more of an affair than they expected the moral of it was at any rate that he was tired verily and must have a bath and dress to which end she would kindly excuse him for the shortest time possible she was to remember afterwards something that had passed between them on this how he had looked for her during an instant at the door before going out how he had met her asking him in hesitation first then quickly in decision whether she couldn t help him by going up with him he had perhaps also for a moment hesitated but he had declined her offer and she was to preserve as i say the memory of the smile with which he had opined that at that rate they wouldn t dine till ten o clock and that he should go straighter and faster alone such things as i say were to come back to her they played through her full after sense like lights on the whole impression the subsequent parts of the experience were not to have blurred their distinctness one of these subsequent parts the first had been the not inconsiderable length to her later and more analytic consciousness of this second wait for her husband s reappearance she might certainly with the best will in the world had she gone up with him have been more in his way than not since people could really almost always hurry better without help than with it still she could actually hardly have made him take more time than he struck her taking though it must indeed be added that there was now in this much thinking little person s state of mind no mere crudity of impatience something had happened rapidly with the beautiful sight of him and with the drop of her fear of having annoyed him by making him go to and fro subsidence of the fearsome for maggie s spirit was always at first positive emergence of the sweet and it was long since anything had been so sweet to her as the particular quality suddenly given by her present emotion to the sense of possession xxvi amerigo was away from her again as she sat there as she walked there without him for she had with the difference of his presence in the house ceased to keep herself from moving about but the hour was filled nevertheless with the effect of his nearness and above all with the effect strange in an intimacy so established of an almost renewed vision of the facts of his aspect she had seen him last but five days since yet he had stood there before her as if restored from some far country some long voyage some combination of dangers or fatigues this unquenchable variety in his appeal to her interest what did it mean but that reduced to the flatness of mere statement she was married by good fortune to an altogether dazzling person that was an old old story but the truth of it shone out to her like the beauty of some family picture some mellow portrait of an ancestor that she might have been looking at almost in surprise after a long intermission the dazzling person was upstairs and she was down and there were moreover the other facts of the selection and decision that this demonstration of her own had required and of the constant care that the equilibrium involved but she had all the same never felt so absorbingly married so abjectly conscious of a master of her fate he could do what he would with her in fact what was actually happening was that he was actually doing it what he would what he really would only that quantity itself escaped perhaps in the brightness of the high harmony familiar naming and discussing it was enough of a recognition for her that whatever the thing he might desire he would always absolutely bring it off she knew at this moment without a question with the fullest surrender how he had brought off in her by scarce more than a single allusion a perfect flutter of tenderness if he had come back tired tired from his long day the exertion had been literally in her service and her father s they two had sat at home at peace the principino between them the complications of life kept down the bores sifted out the large ease of the home preserved because of the way the others held the field and braved the weather amerigo never complained any more than for that matter charlotte did but she seemed to see to night as she had never yet quite done that their business of social representation conceived as they conceived it beyond any conception of her own and conscientiously carried out was an affair of living always in harness she remembered fanny assingham s old judgment that friend s description of her father and herself as not living at all as not knowing what to do or what might be done for them and there came back to her with it an echo of the long talk they had had together one september day at fawns under the trees when she put before him this dictum of fanny s that occasion might have counted for them she had already often made the reflection as the first step in an existence more intelligently arranged it had been an hour from which the chain of causes and consequences was definitely traceable so many things and at the head of the list her father s marriage having appeared to her to flow from charlotte s visit to fawns and that event itself having flowed from the memorable talk but what perhaps most came out in the light of these concatenations was that it had been for all the world as if charlotte had been had in as the servants always said of extra help because they had thus suffered it to be pointed out to them that if their family coach lumbered and stuck the fault was in its lacking its complement of wheels having but three as they might say it had wanted another and what had charlotte done from the first but begin to act on the spot and ever so smoothly and beautifully as a fourth nothing had been immediately more manifest than the greater grace of the movement of the vehicle as to which for the completeness of her image maggie was now supremely to feel how every strain had been lightened for herself so far as she was one of the wheels she had but to keep in her place since the work was done for her she felt no weight and it wasn t too much to acknowledge that she had scarce to turn round she had a long pause before the fire during which she might have been fixing with intensity her projected vision have been conscious even of its taking an absurd fantastic shape she might have been watching the family coach pass and noting that somehow amerigo and charlotte were pulling it while she and her father were not so much as pushing they were seated inside together dandling the principino and holding him up to the windows to see and be seen like an infant positively royal so that the exertion was all with the others maggie found in this image a repeated challenge again and yet again she paused before the fire after which each time in the manner of one for whom a strong light has suddenly broken she gave herself to livelier movement she had seen herself at last in the picture she was studying suddenly jump from the coach whereupon frankly with the wonder of the sight her eyes opened wider and her heart stood still for a moment she looked at the person so acting as if this person were somebody else waiting with intensity to see what would follow the person had taken a decision which was evidently because an impulse long gathering had at last felt a sharpest pressure only how was the decision to be applied what in particular would the figure in the picture do she looked about her from the middle of the room under the force of this question as if there exactly were the field of action involved then as the door opened again she recognised whatever the action the form at any rate of a first opportunity her husband had reappeared he stood before her refreshed almost radiant quite reassuring dressed anointed fragrant ready above all for his dinner he smiled at her over the end of their delay it was as if her opportunity had depended on his look and now she saw that it was good there was still for the instant something in suspense but it passed more quickly than on his previous entrance he was already holding out his arms it was for hours and hours later on as if she had somehow been lifted aloft were floated and carried on some warm high tide beneath which stumbling blocks had sunk out of sight this came from her being again for the time in the enjoyment of confidence from her knowing as she believed what to do all the next day and all the next she appeared to herself to know it she had a plan and she rejoiced in her plan this consisted of the light that suddenly breaking into her restless reverie had marked the climax of that vigil it had come to her as a question what if i ve abandoned them you know what if i ve accepted too passively the funny form of our life there would be a process of her own by which she might do differently in respect to amerigo and charlotte a process quite independent of any process of theirs such a solution had but to rise before her to affect her to charm her with its simplicity an advantageous simplicity she had been stupid for so long not to have been struck by and the simplicity meanwhile seemed proved by the success that had already begun to attend her she had only had herself to do something to see how immediately it answered this consciousness of its having answered with her husband was the uplifting sustaining wave he had met her she so put it to herself met her with an effect of generosity and of gaiety in especial on his coming back to her ready for dinner which she wore in her breast as the token of an escape for them both from something not quite definite but clearly much less good even at that moment in fact her plan had begun to work she had been when he brightly reappeared in the act of plucking it out of the heart of her earnestness plucking it in the garden of thought as if it had been some full blown flower that she could present to him on the spot well it was the flower of participation and as that then and there she held it out to him putting straightway into execution the idea so needlessly so absurdly obscured of her sharing with him whatever the enjoyment the interest the experience might be and sharing also for that matter with charlotte she had thrown herself at dinner into every feature of the recent adventure of the companions letting him see without reserve that she wished to hear everything about it and making charlotte in particular charlotte s judgment of matcham charlotte s aspect her success there her effect traceably produced her clothes inimitably worn her cleverness gracefully displayed her social utility in fine brilliantly exemplified the subject of endless inquiry maggie s inquiry was most empathetic moreover for the whole happy thought of the cathedral hunt which she was so glad they had entertained and as to the pleasant results of which down to the cold beef and bread and cheese the queer old smell and the dirty table cloth at the inn amerigo was good humouredly responsive he had looked at her across the table more than once as if touched by the humility of this welcome offered to impressions at second hand the amusements the large freedoms only of others as if recognising in it something fairly exquisite and at the end while they were alone before she had rung for a servant he had renewed again his condonation of the little irregularity such as it was on which she had ventured they had risen together to come upstairs he had been talking at the last about some of the people at the very last of all about lady castledean and mr blint after which she had once more broken ground on the matter of the type of gloucester it brought her as he came round the table to join her yet another of his kind conscious stares one of the looks visibly beguiled but at the same time not invisibly puzzled with which he had already shown his sense of this charming grace of her curiosity it was as if he might for a moment be going to say you needn t pretend dearest quite so hard needn t think it necessary to care quite so much it was as if he stood there before her with some such easy intelligence some such intimate reassurance on his lips her answer would have been all ready that she wasn t in the least pretending and she looked up at him while he took her hand with the maintenance the real persistence of her lucid little plan in her eyes she wanted him to understand from that very moment that she was going to be with him again quite with them together as she doubtless hadn t been since the funny changes that was really all one could call them into which they had each as for the sake of the others too easily and too obligingly slipped they had taken too much for granted that their life together required as people in london said a special form which was very well so long as the form was kept only for the outside world and was made no more of among themselves than the pretty mould of an iced pudding or something of that sort into which to help yourself you didn t hesitate to break with the spoon so much as that she would with an opening have allowed herself furthermore to observe she wanted him to understand how her scheme embraced charlotte too so that if he had but uttered the acknowledgment she judged him on the point of making the acknowledgment of his catching at her brave little idea for their case she would have found herself as distinctly voluble almost to eloquence what befell however was that even while she thus waited she felt herself present at a process taking place rather deeper within him than the occasion on the whole appeared to require a process of weighing something in the balance of considering deciding dismissing he had guessed that she was there with an idea there in fact by reason of her idea only this oddly enough was what at the last stayed his words she was helped to these perceptions by his now looking at her still harder than he had yet done which really brought it to the turn of a hair for her that she didn t make sure his notion of her idea was the right one it was the turn of a hair because he had possession of her hands and was bending toward her ever so kindly as if to see to understand more or possibly give more she didn t know which and that had the effect of simply putting her as she would have said in his power she gave up let her idea go let everything go her one consciousness was that he was taking her again into his arms it was not till afterwards that she discriminated as to this felt how the act operated with him instead of the words he hadn t uttered operated in his view as probably better than any words as always better in fact at any time than anything her acceptance of it her response to it inevitable foredoomed came back to her later on as a virtual assent to the assumption he had thus made that there was really nothing such a demonstration didn t anticipate and didn t dispose of and that the spring acting within herself moreover might well have been beyond any other the impulse legitimately to provoke it it made for any issue the third time since his return that he had drawn her to his breast and at present holding her to his side as they left the room he kept her close for their moving into the hall and across it kept her for their slow return together to the apartments above he had been right overwhelmingly right as to the felicity of his tenderness and the degree of her sensibility but even while she felt these things sweep all others away she tasted of a sort of terror of the weakness they produced in her it was still for her that she had positively something to do and that she mustn t be weak for this must much rather be strong for many hours after none the less she remained weak if weak it was though holding fast indeed to the theory of her success since her agitated overture had been after all so unmistakably met she recovered soon enough on the whole the sense that this left her charlotte always to deal with charlotte who at any rate however she might meet overtures must meet them at the worst more or less differently of that inevitability of such other ranges of response as were open to charlotte maggie took the measure in approaching her on the morrow of her return from matcham with the same show of desire to hear all her story she wanted the whole picture from her as she had wanted it from her companion and promptly in eaton square whither without the prince she repaired almost ostentatiously for the purpose this purpose only she brought her repeatedly back to the subject both in her husband s presence and during several scraps of independent colloquy before her father instinctively maggie took the ground that his wish for interesting echoes would be not less than her own allowing that is for everything his wife would already have had to tell him for such passages between them as might have occurred since the evening before joining them after luncheon reaching them in her desire to proceed with the application of her idea before they had quitted the breakfast room the scene of their mid day meal she referred in her parent s presence to what she might have lost by delay and expressed the hope that there would be an anecdote or two left for her to pick up charlotte was dressed to go out and her husband it appeared rather positively prepared not to he had left the table but was seated near the fire with two or three of the morning papers and the residuum of the second and third posts on a stand beside him more even than the usual extravagance as maggie s glance made out of circulars catalogues advertisements announcements of sales foreign envelopes and foreign handwritings that were as unmistakable as foreign clothes charlotte at the window looking into the side street that abutted on the square might have been watching for their visitor s advent before withdrawing and in the light strange and coloured like that of a painted picture which fixed the impression for her objects took on values not hitherto so fully shown it was the effect of her quickened sensibility she knew herself again in presence of a problem in need of a solution for which she must intensely work that consciousness lately born in her had been taught the evening before to accept a temporary lapse but had quickly enough again with her getting out of her own house and her walking across half the town for she had come from portland place on foot found breath still in its lungs it exhaled this breath in a sigh faint and unheard her tribute while she stood there before speaking to realities looming through the golden mist that had already begun to be scattered the conditions facing her had yielded for the time to the golden mist had considerably melted away but there they were again definite and it was for the next quarter of an hour as if she could have counted them one by one on her fingers sharp to her above all was the renewed attestation of her father s comprehensive acceptances which she had so long regarded as of the same quality with her own but which so distinctly now she should have the complication of being obliged to deal with separately they had not yet struck her as absolutely extraordinary which had made for her lumping them with her own since her view of her own had but so lately begun to change though it instantly stood out for her that there was really no new judgment of them she should be able to show without attracting in some degree his attention without perhaps exciting his surprise and making thereby for the situation she shared with him some difference she was reminded and warned by the concrete image and for a minute charlotte s face immediately presented to her affected her as searching her own to see the reminder tell she had not less promptly kissed her stepmother and then had bent over her father from behind and laid her cheek upon him little amenities tantamount heretofore to an easy change of guard charlotte s own frequent though always cheerful term of comparison for this process of transfer maggie figured thus as the relieving sentry and so smoothly did use and custom work for them that her mate might even on this occasion after acceptance of the pass word have departed without irrelevant and in strictness unsoldierly gossip this was not none the less what happened inasmuch as if our young woman had been floated over her first impulse to break the existing charm at a stroke it yet took her but an instant to sound at any risk the note she had been privately practising if she had practised it the day before at dinner on amerigo she knew but the better how to begin for it with mrs verver and it immensely helped her for that matter to be able at once to speak of the prince as having done more to quicken than to soothe her curiosity frankly and gaily she had come to ask to ask what in their unusually prolonged campaign the two had achieved she had got out of her husband she admitted what she could but husbands were never the persons who answered such questions ideally he had only made her more curious and she had arrived early this way in order to miss as little as possible of charlotte s story wives papa she said are always much better reporters though i grant she added for charlotte that fathers are not much better than husbands he never she smiled tells me more than a tenth of what you tell him so i hope you haven t told him everything yet since in that case i shall probably have lost the best part of it maggie went she went she felt herself going she reminded herself of an actress who had been studying a part and rehearsing it but who suddenly on the stage before the footlights had begun to improvise to speak lines not in the text it was this very sense of the stage and the footlights that kept her up made her rise higher just as it was the sense of action that logically involved some platform action quite positively for the first time in her life or counting in the previous afternoon for the second the platform remained for three or four days thus sensibly under her feet and she had all the while with it the inspiration of quite remarkably of quite heroically improvising preparation and practice had come but a short way her part opened out and she invented from moment to moment what to say and to do she had but one rule of art to keep within bounds and not lose her head certainly she might see for a week how far that would take her she said to herself in her excitement that it was perfectly simple to bring about a difference touch by touch without letting either of the three and least of all her father so much as suspect her hand if they should suspect they would want a reason and the humiliating truth was that she wasn t ready with a reason not that is with what she would have called a reasonable one she thought of herself instinctively beautifully as having dealt all her life at her father s side and by his example only in reasonable reasons and what she would really have been most ashamed of would be to produce for him in this line some inferior substitute unless she were in a position to plead definitely that she was jealous she should be in no position to plead decently that she was dissatisfied this latter condition would be a necessary implication of the former without the former behind it it would have to fall to the ground so had the case wonderfully been arranged for her there was a card she could play but there was only one and to play it would be to end the game she felt herself as at the small square green table between the tall old silver candlesticks and the neatly arranged counters her father s playmate and partner and what it constantly came back to in her mind was that for her to ask a question to raise a doubt to reflect in any degree on the play of the others would be to break the charm the charm she had to call it since it kept her companion so constantly engaged so perpetually seated and so contentedly occupied to say anything at all would be in fine to have to say why she was jealous and she could in her private hours but stare long with suffused eyes at that impossibility by the end of a week the week that had begun especially with her morning hour in eaton square between her father and his wife her consciousness of being beautifully treated had become again verily greater than her consciousness of anything else and i must add moreover that she at last found herself rather oddly wondering what else as a consciousness could have been quite so overwhelming charlotte s response to the experiment of being more with her ought as she very well knew to have stamped the experiment with the feeling of success so that if the success itself seemed a boon less substantial than the original image of it it enjoyed thereby a certain analogy with our young woman s aftertaste of amerigo s own determined demonstrations maggie was to have retained for that matter more than one aftertaste and if i have spoken of the impressions fixed in her as soon as she had so insidiously taken the field a definite note must be made of her perception during those moments of charlotte s prompt uncertainty she had shown no doubt she couldn t not have shown that she had arrived with an idea quite exactly as she had shown her husband the night before that she was awaiting him with a sentiment this analogy in the two situations was to keep up for her the remembrance of a kinship of expression in the two faces in respect to which all she as yet professed to herself was that she had affected them or at any rate the sensibility each of them so admirably covered in the same way to make the comparison at all was for maggie to return to it often to brood upon it to extract from it the last dregs of its interest to play with it in short nervously vaguely incessantly as she might have played with a medallion containing on either side a cherished little portrait and suspended round her neck by a gold chain of a firm fineness that no effort would ever snap the miniatures were back to back but she saw them forever face to face and when she looked from one to the other she found in charlotte s eyes the gleam of the momentary what does she really want that had come and gone for her in the prince s so again she saw the other light the light touched into a glow both in portland place and in eaton square as soon as she had betrayed that she wanted no harm wanted no greater harm of charlotte that is than to take in that she meant to go out with her she had been present at that process as personally as she might have been present at some other domestic incident the hanging of a new picture say or the fitting of the principino with his first little trousers she remained present accordingly all the week so charmingly and systematically did mrs verver now welcome her company charlotte had but wanted the hint and what was it but the hint after all that during the so subdued but so ineffaceable passage in the breakfast room she had seen her take it had been taken moreover not with resignation not with qualifications or reserves however bland it had been taken with avidity with gratitude with a grace of gentleness that supplanted explanations the very liberality of this accommodation might indeed have appeared in the event to give its own account of the matter as if it had fairly written the princess down as a person of variations and had accordingly conformed but to a rule of tact in accepting these caprices for law the caprice actually prevailing happened to be that the advent of one of the ladies anywhere should till the fit had changed become the sign unfailingly of the advent of the other and it was emblazoned in rich colour on the bright face of this period that mrs verver only wished to know on any occasion what was expected of her only held herself there for instructions in order even to better them if possible the two young women while the passage lasted became again very much the companions of other days the days of charlotte s prolonged visits to the admiring and bountiful maggie the days when equality of condition for them had been all the result of the latter s native vagueness about her own advantages the earlier elements flushed into life again the frequency the intimacy the high pitch of accompanying expression appreciation endearment confidence the rarer charm produced in each by this active contribution to the felicity of the other all enhanced furthermore enhanced or qualified who should say which by a new note of diplomacy almost of anxiety just sensible on charlotte s part in particular of intensity of observance in the matter of appeal and response in the matter of making sure the princess might be disposed or gratified that resembled an attempt to play again with more refinement at disparity of relation charlotte s attitude had in short its moments of flowering into pretty excesses of civility self effacements in the presence of others sudden little formalisms of suggestion and recognition that might have represented her sense of the duty of not losing sight of a social distinction this impression came out most for maggie when in their easier intervals they had only themselves to regard and when her companion s inveteracy of never passing first of not sitting till she was seated of not interrupting till she appeared to give leave of not forgetting too familiarly that in addition to being important she was also sensitive had the effect of throwing over their intercourse a kind of silver tissue of decorum it hung there above them like a canopy of state a reminder that though the lady in waiting was an established favourite safe in her position a little queen however good natured was always a little queen and might with small warning remember it and yet another of these concomitants of feverish success all the while was the perception that in another quarter too things were being made easy charlotte s alacrity in meeting her had in one sense operated slightly overmuch as an intervention it had begun to reabsorb her at the very hour of her husband s showing her that to be all there as the phrase was he likewise only required as one of the other phrases was too the straight tip she had heard him talk about the straight tip in his moods of amusement at english slang in his remarkable displays of assimilative power power worthy of better causes and higher inspirations and he had taken it from her at need in a way that certainly in the first glow of relief had made her brief interval seem large then however immediately and even though superficially there had declared itself a readjustment of relations to which she was once more practically a little sacrificed i must do everything she had said without letting papa see what i do at least till it s done but she scarce knew how she proposed even for the next few days to blind or beguile this participant in her life what had in fact promptly enough happened she presently recognised was that if her stepmother had beautifully taken possession of her and if she had virtually been rather snatched again thereby from her husband s side so on the other hand this had with as little delay entailed some very charming assistance for her in eaton square when she went home with charlotte from whatever happy demonstration for the benefit of the world in which they supposed themselves to live that there was no smallest reason why their closer association shouldn t be public and acclaimed at these times she regularly found that amerigo had come either to sit with his father in law in the absence of the ladies or to make on his side precisely some such display of the easy working of the family life as would represent the equivalent of her excursions with charlotte under this particular impression it was that everything in maggie most melted and went to pieces every thing that is that belonged to her disposition to challenge the perfection of their common state it divided them again that was true this particular turn of the tide cut them up afresh into pairs and parties quite as if a sense for the equilibrium was what between them all had most power of insistence quite as if amerigo himself were all the while at bottom equally thinking of it and watching it but as against that he was making her father not miss her and he could have rendered neither of them a more excellent service he was acting in short on a cue the cue given him by observation it had been enough for him to see the shade of change in her behaviour his instinct for relations the most exquisite conceivable prompted him immediately to meet and match the difference to play somehow into its hands that was what it was she renewedly felt to have married a man who was sublimely a gentleman so that in spite of her not wanting to translate all their delicacies into the grossness of discussion she yet found again and again in portland place moments for saying if i didn t love you you know for yourself i should still love you for him he looked at her after such speeches as charlotte looked in eaton square when she called her attention to his benevolence through the dimness of the almost musing smile that took account of her extravagance harmless though it might be as a tendency to reckon with but my poor child charlotte might under this pressure have been on the point of replying that s the way nice people are all round so that why should one be surprised about it we re all nice together as why shouldn t we be if we hadn t been we wouldn t have gone far and i consider that we ve gone very far indeed why should you take on as if you weren t a perfect dear yourself capable of all the sweetest things as if you hadn t in fact grown up in an atmosphere the atmosphere of all the good things that i recognised even of old as soon as i came near you and that you ve allowed me now between you to make so blessedly my own mrs verver might in fact have but just failed to make another point a point charmingly natural to her as a grateful and irreproachable wife it isn t a bit wonderful i may also remind you that your husband should find when opportunity permits worse things to do than to go about with mine i happen love to appreciate my husband i happen perfectly to understand that his acquaintance should be cultivated and his company enjoyed some such happily provoked remarks as these from charlotte at the other house had been in the air but we have seen how there was also in the air for our young woman as an emanation from the same source a distilled difference of which the very principle was to keep down objections and retorts that impression came back it had its hours of doing so and it may interest us on the ground of its having prompted in maggie a final reflection a reflection out of the heart of which a light flashed for her like a great flower grown in a night as soon as this light had spread a little it produced in some quarters a surprising distinctness made her of a sudden ask herself why there should have been even for three days the least obscurity the perfection of her success decidedly was like some strange shore to which she had been noiselessly ferried and where with a start she found herself quaking at the thought that the boat might have put off again and left her the word for it the word that flashed the light was that they were treating her that they were proceeding with her and for that matter with her father by a plan that was the exact counterpart of her own it was not from her that they took their cue but and this was what in particular made her sit up from each other and with a depth of unanimity an exact coincidence of inspiration that when once her attention had begun to fix it struck her as staring out at her in recovered identities of behaviour expression and tone they had a view of her situation and of the possible forms her own consciousness of it might take a view determined by the change of attitude they had had ever so subtly to recognise in her on their return from matcham they had had to read into this small and all but suppressed variation a mute comment on they didn t quite know what and it now arched over the princess s head like a vault of bold span that important communication between them on the subject couldn t have failed of being immediate this new perception bristled for her as we have said with odd intimations but questions unanswered played in and out of it as well the question for instance of why such promptitude of harmony should have been important ah when she began to recover piece by piece the process became lively she might have been picking small shining diamonds out of the sweepings of her ordered house she bent in this pursuit over her dust bin she challenged to the last grain the refuse of her innocent economy then it was that the dismissed vision of amerigo that evening in arrest at the door of her salottino while her eyes from her placed chair took him in then it was that this immense little memory gave out its full power since the question was of doors she had afterwards she now saw shut it out she had responsibly shut in as we have understood shut in there with her sentient self only the fact of his reappearance and the plenitude of his presence these things had been testimony after all to supersede any other for on the spot even while she looked the warmly washing wave had travelled far up the strand she had subsequently lived for hours she couldn t count under the dizzying smothering welter positively in submarine depths where everything came to her through walls of emerald and mother of pearl though indeed she had got her head above them for breath when face to face with charlotte again on the morrow in eaton square meanwhile none the less as was so apparent the prior the prime impression had remained in the manner of a spying servant on the other side of the barred threshold a witness availing himself in time of the lightest pretext to re enter it was as if he had found this pretext in her observed necessity of comparing comparing the obvious common elements in her husband s and her stepmother s ways of now taking her with or without her witness at any rate she was led by comparison to a sense of the quantity of earnest intention operating and operating so harmoniously between her companions and it was in the mitigated midnight of these approximations that she had made out the promise of her dawn it was a worked out scheme for their not wounding her for their behaving to her quite nobly to which each had in some winning way induced the other to contribute and which therefore so far as that went proved that she had become with them a subject of intimate study quickly quickly on a certain alarm taken eagerly and anxiously before they should without knowing it wound her they had signalled from house to house their clever idea the idea by which for all these days her own idea had been profiting they had built her in with their purpose which was why above her a vault seemed more heavily to arch so that she sat there in the solid chamber of her helplessness as in a bath of benevolence artfully prepared for her over the brim of which she could but just manage to see by stretching her neck baths of benevolence were very well but at least unless one were a patient of some sort a nervous eccentric or a lost child one was usually not so immersed save by one s request it wasn t in the least what she had requested she had flapped her little wings as a symbol of desired flight not merely as a plea for a more gilded cage and an extra allowance of lumps of sugar above all she hadn t complained not by the quaver of a syllable so what wound in particular had she shown her fear of receiving what wound had she received as to which she had exchanged the least word with them if she had ever whined or moped they might have had some reason but she would be hanged she conversed with herself in strong language if she had been from beginning to end anything but pliable and mild it all came back in consequence to some required process of their own a process operating quite positively as a precaution and a policy they had got her into the bath and for consistency with themselves which was with each other must keep her there in that condition she wouldn t interfere with the policy which was established which was arranged her thought over this arrived at a great intensity had indeed its pauses and timidities but always to take afterwards a further and lighter spring the ground was well nigh covered by the time she had made out her husband and his colleague as directly interested in preventing her freedom of movement policy or no policy it was they themselves who were arranged she must be kept in position so as not to disarrange them it fitted immensely together the whole thing as soon as she could give them a motive for strangely as it had by this time begun to appear to herself she had hitherto not imagined them sustained by an ideal distinguishably different from her own of course they were arranged all four arranged but what had the basis of their life been precisely but that they were arranged together amerigo and charlotte were arranged together but she to confine the matter only to herself was arranged apart it rushed over her the full sense of all this with quite another rush from that of the breaking wave of ten days before and as her father himself seemed not to meet the vaguely clutching hand with which during the first shock of complete perception she tried to steady herself she felt very much alone xxvii there had been from far back that is from the christmas time on a plan that the parent and the child should do something lovely together and they had recurred to it on occasion nursed it and brought it up theoretically though without as yet quite allowing it to put its feet to the ground the most it had done was to try a few steps on the drawing room carpet with much attendance on either side much holding up and guarding much anticipation in fine of awkwardness or accident their companions by the same token had constantly assisted at the performance following the experiment with sympathy and gaiety and never so full of applause maggie now made out for herself as when the infant project had kicked its little legs most wildly kicked them for all the world across the channel and half the continent kicked them over the pyrenees and innocently crowed out some rich spanish name she asked herself at present if it had been a real belief that they were but wanting for some such adventure to snatch their moment whether either had at any instant seen it as workable save in the form of a toy to dangle before the other that they should take flight without wife or husband for one more look before they died at the madrid pictures as well as for a drop of further weak delay in respect to three or four possible prizes privately offered rarities of the first water responsibly reported on and profusely photographed still patiently awaiting their noiseless arrival in retreats to which the clue had not otherwise been given away the vision dallied with during the duskier days in eaton square had stretched to the span of three or four weeks of springtime for the total adventure three or four weeks in the very spirit after all of their regular life as their regular life had been persisting full of shared mornings afternoons evenings walks drives looks in at old places on vague chances full also in especial of that purchased social ease the sense of the comfort and credit of their house which had essentially the perfection of something paid for but which came on the whole so cheap that it might have been felt as costing as costing the parent and child nothing it was for maggie to wonder at present if she had been sincere about their going to ask herself whether she would have stuck to their plan even if nothing had happened her view of the impossibility of sticking to it now may give us the measure of her sense that everything had happened a difference had been made in her relation to each of her companions and what it compelled her to say to herself was that to behave as she might have behaved before would be to act for amerigo and charlotte with the highest hypocrisy she saw in these days that a journey abroad with her father would more than anything else have amounted on his part and her own to a last expression of an ecstasy of confidence and that the charm of the idea in fact had been in some such sublimity day after day she put off the moment of speaking as she inwardly and very comprehensively called it speaking that is to her father and all the more that she was ridden by a strange suspense as to his himself breaking silence she gave him time gave him during several days that morning that noon that night and the next and the next and the next even made up her mind that if he stood off longer it would be proof conclusive that he too wasn t at peace they would then have been all successfully throwing dust in each other s eyes and it would be at last as if they must turn away their faces since the silver mist that protected them had begun to grow sensibly thin finally at the end of april she decided that if he should say nothing for another period of twenty four hours she must take it as showing that they were in her private phraseology lost so little possible sincerity could there be in pretending to care for a journey to spain at the approach of a summer that already promised to be hot such a proposal on his lips such an extravagance of optimism would be his way of being consistent for that he didn t really want to move or to move further at the worst than back to fawns again could only signify that he wasn t at heart contented what he wanted at any rate and what he didn t want were in the event put to the proof for maggie just in time to give her a fresh wind she had been dining with her husband in eaton square on the occasion of hospitality offered by mr and mrs verver to lord and lady castledean the propriety of some demonstration of this sort had been for many days before our group the question reduced to the mere issue of which of the two houses should first take the field the issue had been easily settled in the manner of every issue referred in any degree to amerigo and charlotte the initiative obviously belonged to mrs verver who had gone to matcham while maggie had stayed away and the evening in eaton square might have passed for a demonstration all the more personal that the dinner had been planned on intimate lines six other guests only in addition to the host and the hostess of matcham made up the company and each of these persons had for maggie the interest of an attested connection with the easter revels at that visionary house their common memory of an occasion that had clearly left behind it an ineffaceable charm this air of beatific reference less subdued in the others than in amerigo and charlotte lent them together an inscrutable comradeship against which the young woman s imagination broke in a small vain wave it wasn t that she wished she had been of the remembered party and possessed herself of its secrets for she didn t care about its secrets she could concern herself at present absolutely with no secret but her own what occurred was simply that she became aware at a stroke of the quantity of further nourishment required by her own and of the amount of it she might somehow extract from these people whereby she rose of a sudden to the desire to possess and use them even to the extent of braving of fairly defying of directly exploiting of possibly quite enjoying under cover of an evil duplicity the felt element of curiosity with which they regarded her once she was conscious of the flitting wing of this last impression the perception irresistible that she was something for their queer experience just as they were something for hers there was no limit to her conceived design of not letting them escape she went and went again to night after her start was taken went positively as she had felt herself going three weeks before on the morning when the vision of her father and his wife awaiting her together in the breakfast room had been so determinant in this other scene it was lady castledean who was determinant who kindled the light or at all events the heat and who acted on the nerves lady castledean whom she knew she so oddly didn t like in spite of reasons upon reasons the biggest diamonds on the yellowest hair the longest lashes on the prettiest falsest eyes the oldest lace on the most violet velvet the rightest manner on the wrongest assumption her ladyship s assumption was that she kept at every moment of her life every advantage it made her beautifully soft very nearly generous so she didn t distinguish the little protuberant eyes of smaller social insects often endowed with such a range from the other decorative spots on their bodies and wings maggie had liked in london and in the world at large so many more people than she had thought it right to fear right even to so much as judge that it positively quickened her fever to have to recognise in this case such a lapse of all the sequences it was only that a charming clever woman wondered about her that is wondered about her as amerigo s wife and wondered moreover with the intention of kindness and the spontaneity almost of surprise the point of view that one was what she read in their free contemplation in that of the whole eight there was something in amerigo to be explained and she was passed about all tenderly and expertly like a dressed doll held in the right manner by its firmly stuffed middle for the account she could give she might have been made to give it by pressure of her stomach she might have been expected to articulate with a rare imitation of nature oh yes i m here all the while i m also in my way a solid little fact and i cost originally a great deal of money cost that is my father for my outfit and let in my husband for an amount of pains toward my training that money would scarce represent well she would meet them in some such way and she translated her idea into action after dinner before they dispersed by engaging them all unconventionally almost violently to dine with her in portland place just as they were if they didn t mind the same party which was the party she wanted oh she was going she was going she could feel it afresh it was a good deal as if she had sneezed ten times or had suddenly burst into a comic song there were breaks in the connection as there would be hitches in the process she didn t wholly see yet what they would do for her nor quite how herself she should handle them but she was dancing up and down beneath her propriety with the thought that she had at least begun something she so fairly liked to feel that she was a point for convergence of wonder it wasn t after all either that their wonder so much signified that of the cornered six whom it glimmered before her that she might still live to drive about like a flock of sheep the intensity of her consciousness its sharpest savour was in the theory of her having diverted having as they said captured the attention of amerigo and charlotte at neither of whom all the while did she so much as once look she had pitched them in with the six for that matter so far as they themselves were concerned they had dropped for the succession of minutes out of contact with their function had in short startled and impressed abandoned their post they re paralysed they re paralysed she commented deep within so much it helped her own apprehension to hang together that they should suddenly lose their bearings her grasp of appearances was thus out of proportion to her view of causes but it came to her then and there that if she could only get the facts of appearance straight only jam them down into their place the reasons lurking behind them kept uncertain for the eyes by their wavering and shifting wouldn t perhaps be able to help showing it wasn t of course that the prince and mrs verver marvelled to see her civil to their friends it was rather precisely that civil was just what she wasn t she had so departed from any such custom of delicate approach approach by the permitted note the suggested if the accepted vagueness as would enable the people in question to put her off if they wished and the profit of her plan the effect of the violence she was willing to let it go for was exactly in their being the people in question people she had seemed to be rather shy of before and for whom she suddenly opened her mouth so wide later on we may add with the ground soon covered by her agitated but resolute step it was to cease to matter what people they were or weren t but meanwhile the particular sense of them that she had taken home to night had done her the service of seeming to break the ice where that formation was thickest still more unexpectedly the service might have been the same for her father inasmuch as immediately when everyone had gone he did exactly what she had been waiting for and despairing of and did it as he did everything with a simplicity that left any purpose of sounding him deeper of drawing him out further of going in his own frequent phrase behind what he said nothing whatever to do he brought it out straight made it bravely and beautifully irrelevant save for the plea of what they should lose by breaking the charm i guess we won t go down there after all will we mag just when it s getting so pleasant here that was all with nothing to lead up to it but it was done for her at a stroke and done not less more rather for amerigo and charlotte on whom the immediate effect as she secretly as she almost breathlessly measured it was prodigious everything now so fitted for her to everything else that she could feel the effect as prodigious even while sticking to her policy of giving the pair no look there were thus some five wonderful minutes during which they loomed to her sightless eyes on either side of her larger than they had ever loomed before larger than life larger than thought larger than any danger or any safety there was thus a space of time in fine fairly vertiginous for her during which she took no more account of them than if they were not in the room she had never never treated them in any such way not even just now when she had plied her art upon the matcham band her present manner was an intenser exclusion and the air was charged with their silence while she talked with her other companion as if she had nothing but him to consider he had given her the note amazingly by his allusion to the pleasantness that of such an occasion as his successful dinner which might figure as their bribe for renouncing so that it was all as if they were speaking selfishly counting on a repetition of just such extensions of experience maggie achieved accordingly an act of unprecedented energy threw herself into her father s presence as by the absolute consistency with which she held his eyes saying to herself at the same time that she smiled and talked and inaugurated her system what does he mean by it that s the question what does he mean but studying again all the signs in him that recent anxiety had made familiar and counting the stricken minutes on the part of the others it was in their silence that the others loomed as she felt she had had no measure she afterwards knew of this duration but it drew out and out really to what would have been called in simpler conditions awkwardness as if she herself were stretching the cord ten minutes later however in the homeward carriage to which her husband cutting delay short had proceeded at the first announcement ten minutes later she was to stretch it almost to breaking the prince had permitted her to linger much less before his move to the door than they usually lingered at the gossiping close of such evenings which she all responsive took for a sign of his impatience to modify for her the odd effect of his not having and of charlotte s not having instantly acclaimed the issue of the question debated or more exactly settled before them he had had time to become aware of this possible impression in her and his virtually urging her into the carriage was connected with his feeling that he must take action on the new ground a certain ambiguity in her would absolutely have tormented him but he had already found something to soothe and correct as to which she had on her side a shrewd notion of what it would be she was herself for that matter prepared and she was of a truth as she took her seat in the brougham amazed at her preparation it allowed her scarce an interval she brought it straight out i was certain that was what father would say if i should leave him alone i have been leaving him alone and you see the effect he hates now to move he likes too much to be with us but if you see the effect she felt herself magnificently keeping it up perhaps you don t see the cause the cause my dear is too lovely her husband on taking his place beside her had during a minute or two for her watching sense neither said nor done anything he had been for that sense as if thinking waiting deciding yet it was still before he spoke that he as she felt it to be definitely acted he put his arm round her and drew her close indulged in the demonstration the long firm embrace by his single arm the infinite pressure of her whole person to his own that such opportunities had so often suggested and prescribed held accordingly and as she could but too intimately feel exquisitely solicited she had said the thing she was intending and desiring to say and as to which she felt even more than she felt anything else that whatever he might do she mustn t be irresponsible yes she was in his exerted grasp and she knew what that was but she was at the same time in the grasp of her conceived responsibility and the extraordinary thing was that of the two intensities the second was presently to become the sharper he took his time for it meanwhile but he met her speech after a fashion the cause of your father s deciding not to go yes and of my having wanted to let it act for him quietly i mean without my insistence she had in her compressed state another pause and it made her feel as if she were immensely resisting strange enough was this sense for her and altogether new the sense of possessing by miraculous help some advantage that absolutely then and there in the carriage as they rolled she might either give up or keep strange inexpressibly strange so distinctly she saw that if she did give it up she should somehow give up everything for ever and what her husband s grasp really meant as her very bones registered was that she should give it up it was exactly for this that he had resorted to unfailing magic he knew how to resort to it he could be on occasion as she had lately more than ever learned so munificent a lover all of which was precisely a part of the character she had never ceased to regard in him as princely a part of his large and beautiful ease his genius for charm for intercourse for expression for life she should have but to lay her head back on his shoulder with a certain movement to make it definite for him that she didn t resist to this as they went every throb of her consciousness prompted her every throb that is but one the throb of her deeper need to know where she really was by the time she had uttered the rest of her idea therefore she was still keeping her head and intending to keep it though she was also staring out of the carriage window with eyes into which the tears of suffered pain had risen indistinguishable perhaps happily in the dusk she was making an effort that horribly hurt her and as she couldn t cry out her eyes swam in her silence with them all the same through the square opening beside her through the grey panorama of the london night she achieved the feat of not losing sight of what she wanted and her lips helped and protected her by being able to be gay it s not to leave you my dear for that he ll give up anything just as he would go off anywhere i think you know if you would go with him i mean you and he alone maggie pursued with her gaze out of her window for which amerigo s answer again took him a moment ah the dear old boy you would like me to propose him something well if you think you could bear it and leave the prince asked you and charlotte alone why not maggie had also to wait a minute but when she spoke it came clear why shouldn t charlotte be just one of my reasons my not liking to leave her she has always been so good so perfect to me but never so wonderfully as just now we have somehow been more together thinking for the time almost only of each other it has been quite as in old days and she proceeded consummately for she felt it as consummate it s as if we had been missing each other had got a little apart though going on so side by side but the good moments if one only waits for them she hastened to add come round of themselves moreover you ve seen for yourself since you ve made it up so to father feeling for yourself in your beautiful way every difference every air that blows not having to be told or pushed only being perfect to live with through your habit of kindness and your exquisite instincts but of course you ve seen all the while that both he and i have deeply felt how you ve managed managed that he hasn t been too much alone and that i on my side haven t appeared to what you might call neglect him this is always she continued what i can never bless you enough for of all the good things you ve done for me you ve never done anything better she went on explaining as for the pleasure of explaining even though knowing he must recognise as a part of his easy way too her description of his large liberality your taking the child down yourself those days and your coming each time to bring him away nothing in the world nothing you could have invented would have kept father more under the charm besides you know how you ve always suited him and how you ve always so beautifully let it seem to him that he suits you only it has been these last weeks as if you wished just in order to please him to remind him of it afresh so there it is she wound up it s your doing you ve produced your effect that of his wanting not to be even for a month or two where you re not he doesn t want to bother or bore you that i think you know he never has done and if you ll only give me time i ll come round again to making it my care as always that he shan t but he can t bear you out of his sight she had kept it up and up filling it out crowding it in and all really without difficulty for it was every word of it thanks to a long evolution of feeling what she had been primed to the brim with she made the picture forced it upon him hung it before him remembering happily how he had gone so far one day supported by the principino as to propose the zoo in eaton square to carry with him there on the spot under this pleasant inspiration both his elder and his younger companion with the latter of whom he had taken the tone that they were introducing granddaddy granddaddy nervous and rather funking it to lions and tigers more or less at large touch by touch she thus dropped into her husband s silence the truth about his good nature and his good manners and it was this demonstration of his virtue precisely that added to the strangeness even for herself of her failing as yet to yield to him it would be a question but of the most trivial act of surrender the vibration of a nerve the mere movement of a muscle but the act grew important between them just through her doing perceptibly nothing nothing but talk in the very tone that would naturally have swept her into tenderness she knew more and more every lapsing minute taught her how he might by a single rightness make her cease to watch him that rightness a million miles removed from the queer actual falling so short which would consist of his breaking out to her diviningly indulgently with the last happy inconsequence come away with me somewhere you and then we needn t think we needn t even talk of anything of anyone else five words like that would answer her would break her utterly down but they were the only ones that would so serve she waited for them and there was a supreme instant when by the testimony of all the rest of him she seemed to feel them in his heart and on his lips only they didn t sound and as that made her wait again so it made her more intensely watch this in turn showed her that he too watched and waited and how much he had expected something that he now felt wouldn t come yes it wouldn t come if he didn t answer her if he but said the wrong things instead of the right if he could say the right everything would come it hung by a hair that everything might crystallise for their recovered happiness at his touch this possibility glowed at her however for fifty seconds only then to turn cold and as it fell away from her she felt the chill of reality and knew again all but pressed to his heart and with his breath upon her cheek the slim rigour of her attitude a rigour beyond that of her natural being they had silences at last that were almost crudities of mutual resistance silences that persisted through his felt effort to treat her recurrence to the part he had lately played to interpret all the sweetness of her so talking to him as a manner of making love to him ah it was no such manner heaven knew for maggie she could make love if this had been in question better than that on top of which it came to her presently to say keeping in with what she had already spoken except of course that for the question of going off somewhere he d go readily quite delightedly with you i verily believe he d like to have you for a while to himself do you mean he thinks of proposing it the prince after a moment sounded oh no he doesn t ask as you must so often have seen but i believe he d go like a shot as you say if you were to suggest it it had the air she knew of a kind of condition made and she had asked herself while she spoke if it wouldn t cause his arm to let her go the fact that it didn t suggested to her that she had made him of a sudden still more intensely think think with such concentration that he could do but one thing at once and it was precisely as if the concentration had the next moment been proved in him he took a turn inconsistent with the superficial impression a jump that made light of their approach to gravity and represented for her the need in him to gain time that she made out was his drawback that the warning from her had come to him and had come to charlotte after all too suddenly that they were in face of it rearranging that they had to rearrange was all before her again yet to do as they would like they must enjoy a snatch longer or shorter of recovered independence amerigo for the instant was but doing as he didn t like and it was as if she were watching his effort without disguise what s your father s idea this year then about fawns will he go at whitsuntide and will he then stay on maggie went through the form of thought he will really do i imagine as he has in so many ways so often done before do whatever may seem most agreeable to yourself and there s of course always charlotte to be considered only their going early to fawns if they do go she said needn t in the least entail your and my going ah amerigo echoed it needn t in the least entail your and my going we can do as we like what they may do needn t trouble us since they re by good fortune perfectly happy together oh the prince returned your father s never so happy as with you near him to enjoy his being so well i may enjoy it said maggie but i m not the cause of it you re the cause her husband declared of the greater part of everything that s good among us but she received this tribute in silence and the next moment he pursued if mrs verver has arrears of time with you to make up as you say she ll scarcely do it or you scarcely will by our cutting your and my cutting too loose i see what you mean maggie mused he let her for a little to give her attention to it after which shall i just quite of a sudden he asked propose him a journey maggie hesitated but she brought forth the fruit of reflection it would have the merit that charlotte then would be with me with me i mean so much more also that i shouldn t by choosing such a time for going away seem unconscious and ungrateful seem not to respond seem in fact rather to wish to shake her off i should respond on the contrary very markedly by being here alone with her for a month and would you like to be here alone with her for a month i could do with it beautifully or we might even she said quite gaily go together down to fawns you could be so very content without me the prince presently inquired yes my own dear if you could be content for a while with father that would keep me up i might for the time she went on go to stay there with charlotte or better still she might come to portland place oho said the prince with cheerful vagueness i should feel you see she continued that the two of us were showing the same sort of kindness amerigo thought the two of us charlotte and i maggie again hesitated you and i darling i see i see he promptly took it in and what reason shall i give give i mean your father for asking him to go off why the very simplest if you conscientiously can the desire said maggie to be agreeable to him just that only something in this reply made her husband again reflect conscientiously why shouldn t i conscientiously it wouldn t by your own contention he developed represent any surprise for him i must strike him sufficiently as at the worst the last person in the world to wish to do anything to hurt him ah there it was again for maggie the note already sounded the note of the felt need of not working harm why this precautionary view she asked herself afresh when her father had complained at the very least as little as herself with their stillness together so perfect what had suggested so around them the attitude of sparing them her inner vision fixed it once more this attitude saw it in the others as vivid and concrete extended it straight from her companion to charlotte before she was well aware accordingly she had echoed in this intensity of thought amerigo s last words you re the last person in the world to wish to do anything to hurt him she heard herself heard her tone after she had spoken and heard it the more that for a minute after she felt her husband s eyes on her face very close too close for her to see him he was looking at her because he was struck and looking hard though his answer when it came was straight enough why isn t that just what we have been talking about that i ve affected you as fairly studying his comfort and his pleasure he might show his sense of it the prince went on by proposing to me an excursion and you would go with him maggie immediately asked he hung fire but an instant per dio she also had her pause but she broke it since gaiety was in the air with an intense smile you can say that safely because the proposal s one that of his own motion he won t make she couldn t have narrated afterwards and in fact was at a loss to tell herself by what transition what rather marked abruptness of change in their personal relation their drive came to its end with a kind of interval established almost confessed to between them she felt it in the tone with which he repeated after her safely safely as regards being thrown with him perhaps after all in such a case too long he s a person to think you might easily feel yourself to be so it won t maggie said come from father he s too modest their eyes continued to meet on it from corner to corner of the brougham oh your modesty between you but he still smiled for it so that unless i insist we shall simply go on as we are well we re going on beautifully he answered though by no means with the effect it would have had if their mute transaction that of attempted capture and achieved escape had not taken place as maggie said nothing none the less to gainsay his remark it was open to him to find himself the next moment conscious of still another idea i wonder if it would do i mean for me to break in to break in between your father and his wife but there would be a way he said we can make charlotte ask him and then as maggie herself now wondered echoing it again we can suggest to her to suggest to him that he shall let me take him off oh said maggie then if he asks her why i so suddenly break out she ll be able to tell him the reason they were stopping and the footman who had alighted had rung at the house door that you think it would be so charming that i think it would be so charming that we ve persuaded her will be convincing i see maggie went on while the footman came back to let them out i see she said again though she felt a little disconcerted what she really saw of a sudden was that her stepmother might report her as above all concerned for the proposal and this brought her back her need that her father shouldn t think her concerned in any degree for anything she alighted the next instant with a slight sense of defeat her husband to let her out had passed before her and a little in advance he awaited her on the edge of the low terrace a step high that preceded their open entrance on either side of which one of their servants stood the sense of a life tremendously ordered and fixed rose before her and there was something in amerigo s very face while his eyes again met her own through the dusky lamplight that was like a conscious reminder of it he had answered her just before distinctly and it appeared to leave her nothing to say it was almost as if having planned for the last word she saw him himself enjoying it it was almost as if in the strangest way in the world he were paying her back by the production of a small pang that of a new uneasiness for the way she had slipped from him during their drive xxviii maggie s new uneasiness might have had time to drop inasmuch as she not only was conscious during several days that followed of no fresh indication for it to feed on but was even struck in quite another way with an augmentation of the symptoms of that difference she had taken it into her head to work for she recognised by the end of a week that if she had been in a manner caught up her father had been not less so with the effect of her husband s and his wife s closing in together round them and of their all having suddenly begun as a party of four to lead a life gregarious and from that reason almost hilarious so far as the easy sound of it went as never before it might have been an accident and a mere coincidence so at least she said to herself at first but a dozen chances that furthered the whole appearance had risen to the surface pleasant pretexts oh certainly pleasant as pleasant as amerigo in particular could make them for associated undertakings quite for shared adventures for its always turning out amusingly that they wanted to do very much the same thing at the same time and in the same way funny all this was to some extent in the light of the fact that the father and daughter for so long had expressed so few positive desires yet it would be sufficiently natural that if amerigo and charlotte had at last got a little tired of each other s company they should find their relief not so much in sinking to the rather low level of their companions as in wishing to pull the latter into the train in which they so constantly moved we re in the train maggie mutely reflected after the dinner in eaton square with lady castledean we ve suddenly waked up in it and found ourselves rushing along very much as if we had been put in during sleep shoved like a pair of labelled boxes into the van and since i wanted to go i m certainly going she might have added i m moving without trouble they re doing it all for us it s wonderful how they understand and how perfectly it succeeds for that was the thing she had most immediately to acknowledge it seemed as easy for them to make a quartette as it had formerly so long appeared for them to make a pair of couples this latter being thus a discovery too absurdly belated the only point at which day after day the success appeared at all qualified was represented as might have been said by her irresistible impulse to give her father a clutch when the train indulged in one of its occasional lurches then there was no denying it his eyes and her own met so that they were themselves doing active violence as against the others to that very spirit of union or at least to that very achievement of change which she had taken the field to invoke the maximum of change was reached no doubt the day the matcham party dined in portland place the day really perhaps of maggie s maximum of social glory in the sense of its showing for her own occasion her very own with every one else extravagantly rallying and falling in absolutely conspiring to make her its heroine it was as if her father himself always with more initiative as a guest than as a host had dabbled too in the conspiracy and the impression was not diminished by the presence of the assinghams likewise very much caught up now after something of a lull by the side wind of all the rest of the motion and giving our young woman so far at least as fanny was concerned the sense of some special intention of encouragement and applause fanny who had not been present at the other dinner thanks to a preference entertained and expressed by charlotte made a splendid show at this one in new orange coloured velvet with multiplied turquoises and with a confidence furthermore as different as possible her hostess inferred from her too marked betrayal of a belittled state at matcham maggie was not indifferent to her own opportunity to redress this balance which seemed for the hour part of a general rectification she liked making out for herself that on the high level of portland place a spot exempt on all sorts of grounds from jealous jurisdictions her friend could feel as good as any one and could in fact at moments almost appear to take the lead in recognition and celebration so far as the evening might conduce to intensify the lustre of the little princess mrs assingham produced on her the impression of giving her constantly her cue for this and it was in truth partly by her help intelligently quite gratefully accepted that the little princess in maggie was drawn out and emphasised she couldn t definitely have said how it happened but she felt herself for the first time in her career living up to the public and popular notion of such a personage as it pressed upon her from all round rather wondering inwardly too while she did so at that strange mixture in things through which the popular notion could be evidenced for her by such supposedly great ones of the earth as the castledeans and their kind fanny assingham might really have been there at all events like one of the assistants in the ring at the circus to keep up the pace of the sleek revolving animal on whose back the lady in short spangled skirts should brilliantly caper and posture that was all doubtless maggie had forgotten had neglected had declined to be the little princess on anything like the scale open to her but now that the collective hand had been held out to her with such alacrity so that she might skip up into the light even as seemed to her modest mind with such a show of pink stocking and such an abbreviation of white petticoat she could strike herself as perceiving under arched eyebrows where her mistake had been she had invited for the later hours after her dinner a fresh contingent the whole list of her apparent london acquaintance which was again a thing in the manner of little princesses for whom the princely art was a matter of course that was what she was learning to do to fill out as a matter of course her appointed her expected her imposed character and though there were latent considerations that somewhat interfered with the lesson she was having to night an inordinate quantity of practice none of it so successful as when quite wittingly she directed it at lady castledean who was reduced by it at last to an unprecedented state of passivity the perception of this high result caused mrs assingham fairly to flush with responsive joy she glittered at her young friend from moment to moment quite feverishly it was positively as if her young friend had in some marvellous sudden supersubtle way become a source of succour to herself become beautifully divinely retributive the intensity of the taste of these registered phenomena was in fact that somehow by a process and through a connexion not again to be traced she so practised at the same time on amerigo and charlotte with only the drawback her constant check and second thought that she concomitantly practised perhaps still more on her father this last was a danger indeed that for much of the ensuing time had its hours of strange beguilement those at which her sense for precautions so suffered itself to lapse that she felt her communion with him more intimate than any other it couldn t but pass between them that something singular was happening so much as this she again and again said to herself whereby the comfort of it was there after all to be noted just as much as the possible peril and she could think of the couple they formed together as groping with sealed lips but with mutual looks that had never been so tender for some freedom some fiction some figured bravery under which they might safely talk of it the moment was to come and it finally came with an effect as penetrating as the sound that follows the pressure of an electric button when she read the least helpful of meanings into the agitation she had created the merely specious description of their case would have been that after being for a long time as a family delightfully uninterruptedly happy they had still had a new felicity to discover a felicity for which blessedly her father s appetite and her own in particular had been kept fresh and grateful this livelier march of their intercourse as a whole was the thing that occasionally determined in him the clutching instinct we have glanced at very much as if he had said to her in default of her breaking silence first everything is remarkably pleasant isn t it but where for it after all are we up in a balloon and whirling through space or down in the depths of the earth in the glimmering passages of a gold mine the equilibrium the precious condition lasted in spite of rearrangement there had been a fresh distribution of the different weights but the balance persisted and triumphed all of which was just the reason why she was forbidden face to face with the companion of her adventure the experiment of a test if they balanced they balanced she had to take that it deprived her of every pretext for arriving by however covert a process at what he thought but she had her hours thus of feeling supremely linked to him by the rigour of their law and when it came over her that all the while the wish on his side to spare her might be what most worked with him this very fact of their seeming to have nothing inward really to talk about wrapped him up for her in a kind of sweetness that was wanting as a consecration even in her yearning for her husband she was powerless however was only more utterly hushed when the interrupting flash came when she would have been all ready to say to him yes this is by every appearance the best time we ve had yet but don t you see all the same how they must be working together for it and how my very success my success in shifting our beautiful harmony to a new basis comes round to being their success above all their cleverness their amiability their power to hold out their complete possession in short of our life for how could she say as much as that without saying a great deal more without saying they ll do everything in the world that suits us save only one thing prescribe a line for us that will make them separate how could she so much as imagine herself even faintly murmuring that without putting into his mouth the very words that would have made her quail separate my dear do you want them to separate then you want us to you and me for how can the one separation take place without the other that was the question that in spirit she had heard him ask with its dread train moreover of involved and connected inquiries their own separation his and hers was of course perfectly thinkable but only on the basis of the sharpest of reasons well the sharpest the very sharpest would be that they could no longer afford as it were he to let his wife she to let her husband run them in such compact formation and say they accepted this account of their situation as a practical finality acting upon it and proceeding to a division would no sombre ghosts of the smothered past on either side show across the widening strait pale unappeased faces or raise in the very passage deprecating denouncing hands meanwhile however such things might be she was to have occasion to say to herself that there might be but a deeper treachery in recoveries and reassurances she was to feel alone again as she had felt at the issue of her high tension with her husband during their return from meeting the castledeans in eaton square the evening in question had left her with a larger alarm but then a lull had come the alarm after all was yet to be confirmed there came an hour inevitably when she knew with a chill what she had feared and why it had taken this hour a month to arrive but to find it before her was thoroughly to recognise it for it showed her sharply what amerigo had meant in alluding to a particular use that they might make for their reaffirmed harmony and prosperity of charlotte the more she thought at present of the tone he had employed to express their enjoyment of this resource the more it came back to her as the product of a conscious art of dealing with her he had been conscious at the moment of many things conscious even not a little of desiring and thereby of needing to see what she would do in a given case the given case would be that of her being to a certain extent as she might fairly make it out menaced horrible as it was to impute to him any intention represented by such a word why it was that to speak of making her stepmother intervene as they might call it in a question that seemed just then and there quite peculiarly their own business why it was that a turn so familiar and so easy should at the worst strike her as charged with the spirit of a threat was an oddity disconnected for her temporarily from its grounds the adventure of an imagination within her that possibly had lost its way that precisely was doubtless why she had learned to wait as the weeks passed by with a fair or rather indeed with an excessive imitation of resumed serenity there had been no prompt sequel to the prince s equivocal light and that made for patience yet she was none the less to have to admit after delay that the bread he had cast on the waters had come home and that she should thus be justified of her old apprehension the consequence of this in turn was a renewed pang in presence of his remembered ingenuity to be ingenious with her what didn t what mightn t that mean when she had so absolutely never at any point of contact with him put him by as much as the value of a penny to the expense of sparing doubting fearing her of having in any way whatever to reckon with her the ingenuity had been in his simply speaking of their use of charlotte as if it were common to them in an equal degree and his triumph on the occasion had been just in the simplicity she couldn t and he knew it say what was true oh you use her and i use her if you will yes but we use her ever so differently and separately not at all in the same way or degree there s nobody we really use together but ourselves don t you see by which i mean that where our interests are the same i can so beautifully so exquisitely serve you for everything and you can so beautifully so exquisitely serve me the only person either of us needs is the other of us so why as a matter of course in such a case as this drag in charlotte she couldn t so challenge him because it would have been and there she was paralysed the note it would have translated itself on the spot for his ear into jealousy and from reverberation to repercussion would have reached her father s exactly in the form of a cry piercing the stillness of peaceful sleep it had been for many days almost as difficult for her to catch a quiet twenty minutes with her father as it had formerly been easy there had been in fact of old the time so strangely seemed already far away an inevitability in her longer passages with him a sort of domesticated beauty in the calculability round about them of everything but at present charlotte was almost always there when amerigo brought her to eaton square where amerigo was constantly bringing her and amerigo was almost always there when charlotte brought her husband to portland place where charlotte was constantly bringing him the fractions of occasions the chance minutes that put them face to face had as yet of late contrived to count but little between them either for the sense of opportunity or for that of exposure inasmuch as the lifelong rhythm of their intercourse made against all cursory handling of deep things they had never availed themselves of any given quarter of an hour to gossip about fundamentals they moved slowly through large still spaces they could be silent together at any time beautifully with much more comfort than hurriedly expressive it appeared indeed to have become true that their common appeal measured itself for vividness just by this economy of sound they might have been talking at each other when they talked with their companions but these latter assuredly were not in any directer way to gain light on the current phase of their relation such were some of the reasons for which maggie suspected fundamentals as i have called them to be rising by a new movement to the surface suspected it one morning late in may when her father presented himself in portland place alone he had his pretext of that she was fully aware the principino two days before had shown signs happily not persistent of a feverish cold and had notoriously been obliged to spend the interval at home this was ground ample ground for punctual inquiry but what it wasn t ground for she quickly found herself reflecting was his having managed in the interest of his visit to dispense so unwontedly as their life had recently come to be arranged with his wife s attendance it had so happened that she herself was for the hour exempt from her husband s and it will at once be seen that the hour had a quality all its own when i note that remembering how the prince had looked in to say he was going out the princess whimsically wondered if their respective sposi mightn t frankly be meeting whimsically hoped indeed they were temporarily so disposed of strange was her need at moments to think of them as not attaching an excessive importance to their repudiation of the general practice that had rested only a few weeks before on such a consecrated rightness repudiations surely were not in the air they had none of them come to that for wasn t she at this minute testifying directly against them by her own behaviour when she should confess to fear of being alone with her father to fear of what he might then ah with such a slow painful motion as she had a horror of say to her then would be time enough for amerigo and charlotte to confess to not liking to appear to foregather she had this morning a wonderful consciousness both of dreading a particular question from him and of being able to check yes even to disconcert magnificently by her apparent manner of receiving it any restless imagination he might have about its importance the day bright and soft had the breath of summer it made them talk to begin with of fawns of the way fawns invited maggie aware the while that in thus regarding with him the sweetness of its invitation to one couple just as much as to another her humbugging smile grew very nearly convulsive that was it and there was relief truly of a sort in taking it in she was humbugging him already by absolute necessity as she had never never done in her life doing it up to the full height of what she had allowed for the necessity in the great dimly shining room where declining for his reasons to sit down he moved about in amerigo s very footsteps the necessity affected her as pressing upon her with the very force of the charm itself of the old pleasantness between them so candidly playing up there again of the positive flatness of their tenderness a surface all for familiar use quite as if generalised from the long succession of tapestried sofas sweetly faded on which his theory of contentment had sat through unmeasured pauses beside her own she knew from this instant knew in advance and as well as anything would ever teach her that she must never intermit for a solitary second her so highly undertaking to prove that there was nothing the matter with her she saw of a sudden everything she might say or do in the light of that undertaking established connections from it with any number of remote matters struck herself for instance as acting all in its interest when she proposed their going out in the exercise of their freedom and in homage to the season for a turn in the regent s park this resort was close at hand at the top of portland place and the principino beautifully better had already proceeded there under high attendance all of which considerations were defensive for maggie all of which became to her mind part of the business of cultivating continuity upstairs while she left him to put on something to go out in the thought of his waiting below for her in possession of the empty house brought with it sharply if briefly one of her abrupt arrests of consistency the brush of a vain imagination almost paralysing her often for the minute before her glass the vivid look in other words of the particular difference his marriage had made the particular difference seemed at such instants the loss more than anything else of their old freedom their never having had to think where they were together concerned of any one of anything but each other it hadn t been her marriage that did it that had never for three seconds suggested to either of them that they must act diplomatically must reckon with another presence no not even with her husband s she groaned to herself while the vain imagination lasted why did he marry ah why did he and then it came up to her more than ever that nothing could have been more beautiful than the way in which till charlotte came so much more closely into their life amerigo hadn t interfered what she had gone on owing him for this mounted up again to her eyes like a column of figures or call it even if one would a house of cards it was her father s wonderful act that had tipped the house down and made the sum wrong with all of which immediately after her question her why did he why did he rushed back inevitably the confounding the overwhelming wave of the knowledge of his reason he did it for me he did it for me she moaned he did it exactly that our freedom meaning beloved man simply and solely mine should be greater instead of less he did it divinely to liberate me so far as possible from caring what became of him she found time upstairs even in her haste as she had repeatedly found time before to let the wonderments involved in these recognitions flash at her with their customary effect of making her blink the question in especial of whether she might find her solution in acting herself in the spirit of what he had done in forcing her care really to grow as much less as he had tried to make it thus she felt the whole weight of their case drop afresh upon her shoulders was confronted unmistakably with the prime source of her haunted state it all came from her not having been able not to mind not to mind what became of him not having been able without anxiety to let him go his way and take his risk and lead his life she had made anxiety her stupid little idol and absolutely now while she stuck a long pin a trifle fallaciously into her hat she had with an approach to irritation told her maid a new woman whom she had lately found herself thinking of as abysmal that she didn t want her she tried to focus the possibility of some understanding between them in consequence of which he should cut loose very near indeed it looked any such possibility that consciousness too had taken its turn by the time she was ready all the vibration all the emotion of this present passage being precisely in the very sweetness of their lapse back into the conditions of the simpler time into a queer resemblance between the aspect and the feeling of the moment and those of numberless other moments that were sufficiently far away she had been quick in her preparation in spite of the flow of the tide that sometimes took away her breath but a pause once more was still left for her to make a pause at the top of the stairs before she came down to him in the span of which she asked herself if it weren t thinkable from the perfectly practical point of view that she should simply sacrifice him she didn t go into the detail of what sacrificing him would mean she didn t need to so distinct was it in one of her restless lights that there he was awaiting her that she should find him walking up and down the drawing room in the warm fragrant air to which the open windows and the abundant flowers contributed slowly and vaguely moving there and looking very slight and young and superficially manageable almost as much like her child putting it a little freely as like her parent with the appearance about him above all of having perhaps arrived just on purpose to say it to her himself in so many words sacrifice me my own love do sacrifice me do sacrifice me should she want to should she insist on it she might verily hear him bleating it at her all conscious and all accommodating like some precious spotless exceptionally intelligent lamb the positive effect of the intensity of this figure however was to make her shake it away in her resumed descent and after she had rejoined him after she had picked him up she was to know the full pang of the thought that her impossibility was made absolutely by his consciousness by the lucidity of his intention this she felt while she smiled there for him again all hypocritically while she drew on fair fresh gloves while she interrupted the process first to give his necktie a slightly smarter twist and then to make up to him for her hidden madness by rubbing her nose into his cheek according to the tradition of their frankest levity from the instant she should be able to convict him of intending every issue would be closed and her hypocrisy would have to redouble the only way to sacrifice him would be to do so without his dreaming what it might be for she kissed him she arranged his cravat she dropped remarks she guided him out she held his arm not to be led but to lead him and taking it to her by much the same intimate pressure she had always used when a little girl to mark the inseparability of her doll she did all these things so that he should sufficiently fail to dream of what they might be for xxix there was nothing to show that her effort in any degree fell short till they got well into the park and he struck her as giving unexpectedly the go by to any serious search for the principino the way they sat down awhile in the sun was a sign of that his dropping with her into the first pair of sequestered chairs they came across and waiting a little after they were placed as if now at last she might bring out as between them something more specific it made her but feel the more sharply how the specific in almost any direction was utterly forbidden her how the use of it would be for all the world like undoing the leash of a dog eager to follow up a scent it would come out the specific where the dog would come out would run to earth somehow the truth for she was believing herself in relation to the truth at which she mustn t so much as indirectly point such at any rate was the fashion in which her passionate prudence played over possibilities of danger reading symptoms and betrayals into everything she looked at and yet having to make it evident while she recognised them that she didn t wince there were moments between them in their chairs when he might have been watching her guard herself and trying to think of something new that would trip her up there were pauses during which with her affection as sweet and still as the sunshine she might yet as at some hard game over a table for money have been defying him to fasten upon her the least little complication of consciousness she was positively proud afterwards of the great style in which she had kept this up later on at the hour s end when they had retraced their steps to find amerigo and charlotte awaiting them at the house she was able to say to herself that truly she had put her plan through even though once more setting herself the difficult task of making their relation every minute of the time not fall below the standard of that other hour in the treasured past which hung there behind them like a framed picture in a museum a high watermark for the history of their old fortune the summer evening in the park at fawns when side by side under the trees just as now they had let their happy confidence lull them with its most golden tone there had been the possibility of a trap for her at present in the very question of their taking up anew that residence wherefore she had not been the first to sound it in spite of the impression from him of his holding off to see what she would do she was saying to herself in secret can we again in this form migrate there can i for myself undertake it face all the intenser keeping up and stretching out indefinitely impossibly that our conditions in the country as we ve established and accepted them would stand for she had positively lost herself in this inward doubt so much she was subsequently to remember but remembering then too that her companion though perceptibly perhaps as if not to be eager had broken the ice very much as he had broken it in eaton square after the banquet to the castledeans her mind had taken a long excursion wandered far into the vision of what a summer at fawns with amerigo and charlotte still more eminently in presence against that higher sky would bring forth wasn t her father meanwhile only pretending to talk of it just as she was in a manner pretending to listen he got off it finally at all events for the transition it couldn t well help thrusting out at him it had amounted exactly to an arrest of her private excursion by the sense that he had begun to imitate oh as never yet the ancient tone of gold it had verily come from him at last the question of whether she thought it would be very good but very good indeed that he should leave england for a series of weeks on some pretext with the prince then it had been that she was to know her husband s menace hadn t really dropped since she was face to face with the effect of it ah the effect of it had occupied all the rest of their walk had stayed out with them and come home with them besides making it impossible that they shouldn t presently feign to recollect how rejoining the child had been their original purpose maggie s uneffaced note was that it had at the end of five minutes more driven them to that endeavour as to a refuge and caused them afterwards to rejoice as well that the boy s irrepressibly importunate company in due course secured and enjoyed with the extension imparted by his governess a person expectant of consideration constituted a cover for any awkwardness for that was what it had all come to that the dear man had spoken to her to try her quite as he had been spoken to himself by charlotte with the same fine idea the princess took it in on the spot firmly grasping it she heard them together her father and his wife dealing with the queer case the prince tells me that maggie has a plan for your taking some foreign journey with him and as he likes to do everything she wants he has suggested my speaking to you for it as the thing most likely to make you consent so i do speak see being always so eager myself as you know to meet maggie s wishes i speak but without quite understanding this time what she has in her head why should she of a sudden at this particular moment desire to ship you off together and to remain here alone with me the compliment s all to me i admit and you must decide quite as you like the prince is quite ready evidently to do his part but you ll have it out with him that is you ll have it out with her something of that kind was what in her mind s ear maggie heard and this after his waiting for her to appeal to him directly was her father s invitation to her to have it out well as she could say to herself all the rest of the day that was what they did while they continued to sit there in their penny chairs that was what they had done as much as they would now ever ever have out anything the measure of this at least had been given that each would fight to the last for the protection for the perversion of any real anxiety she had confessed instantly with her humbugging grin not flinching by a hair meeting his eyes as mildly as he met hers she had confessed to her fancy that they might both he and his son in law have welcomed such an escapade since they had both been so long so furiously domestic she had almost cocked her hat under the inspiration of this opportunity to hint how a couple of spirited young men reacting from confinement and sallying forth arm in arm might encounter the agreeable in forms that would strike them for the time at least as novel she had felt for fifty seconds with her eyes all so sweetly and falsely in her companion s horribly vulgar yet without minding it either such luck should she have if to be nothing worse than vulgar would see her through and i thought amerigo might like it better she had said than wandering off alone do you mean that he won t go unless i take him she had considered here and never in her life had she considered so promptly and so intently if she really put it that way her husband challenged might belie the statement so that what would that do but make her father wonder make him perhaps ask straight out why she was exerting pressure she couldn t of course afford to be suspected for an instant of exerting pressure which was why she was obliged only to make answer wouldn t that be just what you must have out with him decidedly if he makes me the proposal but he hasn t made it yet oh once more how she was to feel she had smirked perhaps he s too shy because you re so sure he so really wants my company i think he has thought you might like it well i should but with this he looked away from her and she held her breath to hear him either ask if she wished him to address the question to amerigo straight or inquire if she should be greatly disappointed by his letting it drop what had settled her as she was privately to call it was that he had done neither of these things and had thereby markedly stood off from the risk involved in trying to draw out her reason to attenuate on the other hand this appearance and quite as if to fill out the too large receptacle made so musingly by his abstention he had himself presently given her a reason had positively spared her the effort of asking whether he judged charlotte not to have approved he had taken everything on himself that was what had settled her she had had to wait very little more to feel with this how much he was taking the point he made was his lack of any eagerness to put time and space on any such scale between himself and his wife he wasn t so unhappy with her far from it and maggie was to hold that he had grinned back paternally through his rather shielding glasses in easy emphasis of this as to be able to hint that he required the relief of absence therefore unless it was for the prince himself oh i don t think it would have been for amerigo himself amerigo and i maggie had said perfectly rub on together well then there we are i see and she had again with sublime blandness assented there we are charlotte and i too her father had gaily proceeded perfectly rub on together and then he had appeared for a little to be making time to put it only so he had mildly and happily added to put it only so he had spoken as if he might easily put it much better yet as if the humour of contented understatement fairly sufficed for the occasion he had played then either all consciously or all unconsciously into charlotte s hands and the effect of this was to render trebly oppressive maggie s conviction of charlotte s plan she had done what she wanted his wife had which was also what amerigo had made her do she had kept her test maggie s test from becoming possible and had applied instead a test of her own it was exactly as if she had known that her stepdaughter would be afraid to be summoned to say under the least approach to cross examination why any change was desirable and it was for our young woman herself still more prodigiously as if her father had been capable of calculations to match of judging it important he shouldn t be brought to demand of her what was the matter with her why otherwise with such an opportunity hadn t he demanded it always from calculation that was why that was why he was terrified of the retort he might have invoked what my dear if you come to that is the matter with you when a minute later on he had followed up his last note by a touch or two designed still further to conjure away the ghost of the anomalous at that climax verily she would have had to be dumb to the question there seems a kind of charm doesn t there on our life and quite as if just lately it had got itself somehow renewed had waked up refreshed a kind of wicked selfish prosperity perhaps as if we had grabbed everything fixed everything down to the last lovely object for the last glass case of the last corner left over of my old show that s the only take off that it has made us perhaps lazy a wee bit languid lying like gods together all careless of mankind do you consider that we re languid that form of rejoinder she had jumped at for the sake of its pretty lightness do you consider that we are careless of mankind living as we do in the biggest crowd in the world and running about always pursued and pursuing it had made him think indeed a little longer than she had meant but he came up again as she might have said smiling well i don t know we get nothing but the fun do we no she had hastened to declare we certainly get nothing but the fun we do it all he had remarked so beautifully we do it all so beautifully she hadn t denied this for a moment i see what you mean well i mean too he had gone on that we haven t no doubt enough the sense of difficulty enough enough for what enough not to be selfish i don t think you are selfish she had returned and had managed not to wail it i don t say that it s me particularly or that it s you or charlotte or amerigo but we re selfish together we move as a selfish mass you see we want always the same thing he had gone on and that holds us that binds us together we want each other he had further explained only wanting it each time for each other that s what i call the happy spell but it s also a little possibly the immorality the immorality she had pleasantly echoed well we re tremendously moral for ourselves that is for each other and i won t pretend that i know exactly at whose particular personal expense you and i for instance are happy what it comes to i daresay is that there s something haunting as if it were a bit uncanny in such a consciousness of our general comfort and privilege unless indeed he had rambled on it s only i to whom fantastically it says so much that s all i mean at any rate that it s sort of soothing as if we were sitting about on divans with pigtails smoking opium and seeing visions let us then be up and doing what is it longfellow says that seems sometimes to ring out like the police breaking in into our opium den to give us a shake but the beauty of it is at the same time that we are doing we re doing that is after all what we went in for we re working it our life our chance whatever you may call it as we saw it as we felt it from the first we have worked it and what more can you do than that it s a good deal for me he had wound up to have made charlotte so happy to have so perfectly contented her you from a good way back were a matter of course i mean your being all right so that i needn t mind your knowing that my great interest since then has rather inevitably been in making sure of the same success very much to your advantage as well for charlotte if we ve worked our life our idea really as i say if at any rate i can sit here and say that i ve worked my share of it it has not been what you may call least by our having put charlotte so at her ease that has been soothing all round that has curled up as the biggest of the blue fumes or whatever they are of the opium don t you see what a cropper we would have come if she hadn t settled down as she has and he had concluded by turning to maggie as for something she mightn t really have thought of you darling in that case i verily believe would have been the one to hate it most to hate it maggie had wondered to hate our having with our tremendous intentions not brought it off and i daresay i should have hated it for you even more than for myself that s not unlikely perhaps when it was for me after all that you did it he had hesitated but only a moment i never told you so well charlotte herself soon enough told me but i never told her her father had answered are you very sure she had presently asked well i like to think how thoroughly i was taken with her and how right i was and how fortunate to have that for my basis i told her all the good i thought of her then that maggie had returned was precisely part of the good i mean it was precisely part of it that she could so beautifully understand yes understand everything everything and in particular your reasons her telling me that showed me how she had understood they were face to face again now and she saw she had made his colour rise it was as if he were still finding in her eyes the concrete image the enacted scene of her passage with charlotte which he was now hearing of for the first time and as to which it would have been natural he should question her further his forbearance to do so would but mark precisely the complication of his fears what she does like he finally said is the way it has succeeded your marriage yes my whole idea the way i ve been justified that s the joy i give her if for her either it had failed that however was not worth talking about he had broken off you think then you could now risk fawns risk it well morally from the point of view i was talking of that of our sinking deeper into sloth our selfishness somehow seems at its biggest down there maggie had allowed him the amusement of her not taking this up is charlotte she had simply asked really ready oh if you and i and amerigo are whenever one corners charlotte he had developed more at his ease one finds that she only wants to know what we want which is what we got her for what we got her for exactly and so for a little even though with a certain effect of oddity in their more or less successful ease they left it left it till maggie made the remark that it was all the same wonderful her stepmother should be willing before the season was out to exchange so much company for so much comparative solitude ah he had then made answer that s because her idea i think this time is that we shall have more people more than we ve hitherto had in the country don t you remember that that originally was what we were to get her for oh yes to give us a life maggie had gone through the form of recalling this and the light of their ancient candour shining from so far back had seemed to bring out some things so strangely that with the sharpness of the vision she had risen to her feet well with a life fawns will certainly do he had remained in his place while she looked over his head the picture in her vision had suddenly swarmed the vibration was that of one of the lurches of the mystic train in which with her companion she was travelling but she was having to steady herself this time before meeting his eyes she had measured indeed the full difference between the move to fawns because each of them now knew the others wanted it and the pairing off for a journey of her husband and her father which nobody knew that either wanted more company at fawns would be effectually enough the key in which her husband and her stepmother were at work there was truly no question but that she and her father must accept any array of visitors no one could try to marry him now what he had just said was a direct plea for that and what was the plea itself but an act of submission to charlotte he had from his chair been noting her look but he had the next minute also risen and then it was they had reminded each other of their having come out for the boy their junction with him and with his companion successfully effected the four had moved home more slowly and still more vaguely yet with a vagueness that permitted of maggie s reverting an instant to the larger issue if we have people in the country then as you were saying do you know for whom my first fancy would be you may be amused but it would be for the castledeans i see but why should i be amused well i mean i am myself i don t think i like her and yet i like to see her which as amerigo says is rum but don t you feel she s very handsome her father inquired yes but it isn t for that then what is it for simply that she may be there just there before us it s as if she may have a value as if something may come of her i don t in the least know what and she rather irritates me meanwhile i don t even know i admit why but if we see her often enough i may find out does it matter so very much her companion had asked while they moved together she had hesitated you mean because you do rather like her he on his side too had waited a little but then he had taken it from her yes i guess i do rather like her which she accepted for the first case she could recall of their not being affected by a person in the same way it came back therefore to his pretending but she had gone far enough and to add to her appearance of levity she further observed that though they were so far from a novelty she should also immediately desire at fawns the presence of the assinghams that put everything on a basis independent of explanations yet it was extraordinary at the same time how much once in the country again with the others she was going as they used to say at home to need the presence of the good fanny it was the strangest thing in the world but it was as if mrs assingham might in a manner mitigate the intensity of her consciousness of charlotte it was as if the two would balance one against the other as if it came round again in that fashion to her idea of the equilibrium it would be like putting this friend into her scale to make weight into the scale with her father and herself amerigo and charlotte would be in the other therefore it would take the three of them to keep that one straight and as this played all duskily in her mind it had received from her father with a sound of suddenness a luminous contribution ah rather do let s have the assinghams it would be to have them she had said as we used so much to have them for a good long stay in the old way and on the old terms as regular boarders fanny used to call it that is if they ll come as regular boarders on the old terms that s what i should like too but i guess they ll come her companion had added in a tone into which she had read meanings the main meaning was that he felt he was going to require them quite as much as she was his recognition of the new terms as different from the old what was that practically but a confession that something had happened and a perception that interested in the situation she had helped to create mrs assingham would be by so much as this concerned in its inevitable development it amounted to an intimation off his guard that he should be thankful for some one to turn to if she had wished covertly to sound him he had now in short quite given himself away and if she had even at the start needed anything more to settle her here assuredly was enough he had hold of his small grandchild as they retraced their steps swinging the boy s hand and not bored as he never was by his always bristling like a fat little porcupine with shrill interrogation points so that secretly while they went she had wondered again if the equilibrium mightn t have been more real mightn t above all have demanded less strange a study had it only been on the books that charlotte should give him a principino of his own she had repossessed herself now of his other arm only this time she was drawing him back gently helplessly back to what they had tried for the hour to get away from just as he was consciously drawing the child and as high miss bogle on her left representing the duties of home was complacently drawing her the duties of home when the house in portland place reappeared showed even from a distance as vividly there before them amerigo and charlotte had come in that is amerigo had charlotte rather having come out and the pair were perched together in the balcony he bare headed she divested of her jacket her mantle or whatever but crowned with a brilliant brave hat responsive to the balmy day which maggie immediately spotted as new as insuperably original as worn in characteristic generous harmony for the first time all evidently to watch for the return of the absent to be there to take them over again as punctually as possible they were gay they were amused in the pleasant morning they leaned across the rail and called down their greeting lighting up the front of the great black house with an expression that quite broke the monotony that might almost have shocked the decency of portland place the group on the pavement stared up as at the peopled battlements of a castle even miss bogle who carried her head most aloft gaped a little through the interval of space as toward truly superior beings there could scarce have been so much of the open mouth since the dingy waits on christmas eve had so lamentably chanted for pennies the time when amerigo insatiable for english customs had come out with a gasped santissima vergine to marvel at the depositaries of this tradition and purchase a reprieve maggie s individual gape was inevitably again for the thought of how the pair would be at work xxx she had not again for weeks had mrs assingham so effectually in presence as on the afternoon of that lady s return from the easter party at matcham but the intermission was made up as soon as the date of the migration to fawns that of the more or less simultaneous adjournment of the two houses began to be discussed it had struck her promptly that this renewal with an old friend of the old terms she had talked of with her father was the one opening for her spirit that wouldn t too much advertise or betray her even her father who had always as he would have said believed in their ancient ally wouldn t necessarily suspect her of invoking fanny s aid toward any special inquiry and least of all if fanny would only act as fanny so easily might maggie s measure of fanny s ease would have been agitating to mrs assingham had it been all at once revealed to her as for that matter it was soon destined to become even on a comparatively graduated showing our young woman s idea in particular was that her safety her escape from being herself suspected of suspicion would proceed from this friend s power to cover to protect and as might be even showily to represent her represent that is her relation to the form of the life they were all actually leading this would doubtless be as people said a large order but that mrs assingham existed substantially or could somehow be made prevailingly to exist for her private benefit was the finest flower maggie had plucked from among the suggestions sown like abundant seed on the occasion of the entertainment offered in portland place to the matcham company mrs assingham that night rebounding from dejection had bristled with bravery and sympathy she had then absolutely she had perhaps recklessly for herself betrayed the deeper and darker consciousness an impression it would now be late for her inconsistently to attempt to undo it was with a wonderful air of giving out all these truths that the princess at present approached her again making doubtless at first a sufficient scruple of letting her know what in especial she asked of her yet not a bit ashamed as she in fact quite expressly declared of fanny s discerned foreboding of the strange uses she might perhaps have for her quite from the first really maggie said extraordinary things to her such as you can help me you know my dear when nobody else can such as i almost wish upon my word that you had something the matter with you that you had lost your health or your money or your reputation forgive me love so that i might be with you as much as i want or keep you with me without exciting comment without exciting any other remark than that such kindnesses are like me we have each our own way of making up for our unselfishness and maggie who had no small self at all as against her husband or her father and only a weak and uncertain one as against her stepmother would verily at this crisis have seen mrs assingham s personal life or liberty sacrificed without a pang the attitude that the appetite in question maintained in her was to draw peculiar support moreover from the current aspects and agitations of her victim this personage struck her in truth as ready for almost anything as not perhaps effusively protesting yet as wanting with a restlessness of her own to know what she wanted and in the long run which was none so long either there was to be no difficulty as happened about that it was as if for all the world maggie had let her see that she held her that she made her fairly responsible for something not to begin with dotting all the i s nor hooking together all the links but treating her without insistence rather with caressing confidence as there to see and to know to advise and to assist the theory visibly had patched itself together for her that the dear woman had somehow from the early time had a hand in all their fortunes so that there was no turn of their common relations and affairs that couldn t be traced back in some degree to her original affectionate interest on this affectionate interest the good lady s young friend now built before her eyes very much as a wise or even as a mischievous child playing on the floor might pile up blocks skilfully and dizzily with an eye on the face of a covertly watching elder when the blocks tumbled down they but acted after the nature of blocks yet the hour would come for their rising so high that the structure would have to be noticed and admired mrs assingham s appearance of unreservedly giving herself involved meanwhile on her own side no separate recognitions her face of almost anxious attention was directed altogether to her young friend s so vivid felicity it suggested that she took for granted at the most certain vague recent enhancements of that state if the princess now more than before was going and going she was prompt to publish that she beheld her go that she had always known she would sooner or later and that any appeal for participation must more or less contain and invite the note of triumph there was a blankness in her blandness assuredly and very nearly an extravagance in her generalising gaiety a precipitation of cheer particularly marked whenever they met again after short separations meetings during the first flush of which maggie sometimes felt reminded of other looks in other faces of two strangely unobliterated impressions above all the physiognomic light that had played out in her husband at the shock she had come at last to talk to herself of the shock of his first vision of her on his return from matcham and gloucester and the wonder of charlotte s beautiful bold wavering gaze when the next morning in eaton square this old friend had turned from the window to begin to deal with her if she had dared to think of it so crudely she would have said that fanny was afraid of her afraid of something she might say or do even as for their few brief seconds amerigo and charlotte had been which made exactly an expressive element common to the three the difference however was that this look had in the dear woman its oddity of a constant renewal whereas it had never for the least little instant again peeped out of the others other looks other lights radiant and steady with the others had taken its place reaching a climax so short a time ago that morning of the appearance of the pair on the balcony of her house to overlook what she had been doing with her father when their general interested brightness and beauty attuned to the outbreak of summer had seemed to shed down warmth and welcome and the promise of protection they were conjoined not to do anything to startle her and now at last so completely that with experience and practice they had almost ceased to fear their liability mrs assingham on the other hand deprecating such an accident not less had yet less assurance as having less control the high pitch of her cheer accordingly the tentative adventurous expressions of the would be smiling order that preceded her approach even like a squad of skirmishers or whatever they were called moving ahead of the baggage train these things had at the end of a fortnight brought a dozen times to our young woman s lips a challenge that had the cunning to await its right occasion but of the relief of which as a demonstration she meanwhile felt no little need you ve such a dread of my possibly complaining to you that you keep pealing all the bells to drown my voice but don t cry out my dear till you re hurt and above all ask yourself how i can be so wicked as to complain what in the name of all that s fantastic can you dream that i have to complain of such inquiries the princess temporarily succeeded in repressing and she did so in a measure by the aid of her wondering if this ambiguity with which her friend affected her wouldn t be at present a good deal like the ambiguity with which she herself must frequently affect her father she wondered how she should enjoy on his part such a take up as she but just succeeded from day to day in sparing mrs assingham and that made for her trying to be as easy with this associate as mr verver blessed man all indulgent but all inscrutable was with his daughter she had extracted from her none the less a vow in respect to the time that if the colonel might be depended on they would spend at fawns and nothing came home to her more in this connection or inspired her with a more intimate interest than her sense of absolutely seeing her interlocutress forbear to observe that charlotte s view of a long visit even from such allies was there to be reckoned with fanny stood off from that proposition as visibly to the princess and as consciously to herself as she might have backed away from the edge of a chasm into which she feared to slip a truth that contributed again to keep before our young woman her own constant danger of advertising her subtle processes that charlotte should have begun to be restrictive about the assinghams which she had never and for a hundred obviously good reasons been before this in itself was a fact of the highest value for maggie and of a value enhanced by the silence in which fanny herself so much too unmistakably dressed it what gave it quite thrillingly its price was exactly the circumstance that it thus opposed her to her stepmother more actively if she was to back up her friends for holding out than she had ever yet been opposed though of course with the involved result of the fine chance given mrs verver to ask her husband for explanations ah from the moment she should be definitely caught in opposition there would be naturally no saying how much charlotte s opportunities might multiply what would become of her father she hauntedly asked if his wife on the one side should begin to press him to call his daughter to order and the force of old habit to put it only at that should dispose him not less effectively to believe in this young person at any price there she was all round imprisoned in the circle of the reasons it was impossible she should give certainly give him the house in the country was his house and thereby was charlotte s it was her own and amerigo s only so far as its proper master and mistress should profusely place it at their disposal maggie felt of course that she saw no limit to her father s profusion but this couldn t be even at the best the case with charlotte s whom it would never be decent when all was said to reduce to fighting for her preferences there were hours truly when the princess saw herself as not unarmed for battle if battle might only take place without spectators this last advantage for her was however too sadly out of the question her sole strength lay in her being able to see that if charlotte wouldn t want the assinghams it would be because that sentiment too would have motives and grounds she had all the while command of one way of meeting any objection any complaint on his wife s part reported to her by her father it would be open to her to retort to his possible what are your reasons my dear by a lucidly produced what are hers love please isn t that what we had better know mayn t her reasons be a dislike beautifully founded of the presence and thereby of the observation of persons who perhaps know about her things it s inconvenient to her they should know that hideous card she might in mere logic play being by this time at her still swifter private pace intimately familiar with all the fingered pasteboard in her pack but she could play it only on the forbidden issue of sacrificing him the issue so forbidden that it involved even a horror of finding out if he would really have consented to be sacrificed what she must do she must do by keeping her hands off him and nothing meanwhile as we see had less in common with that scruple than such a merciless manipulation of their yielding beneficiaries as her spirit so boldly revelled in she saw herself in this connexion without detachment saw others alone with intensity otherwise she might have been struck fairly have been amused by her free assignment of the pachydermatous quality if she could face the awkwardness of the persistence of her friends at fawns in spite of charlotte she somehow looked to them for an inspiration of courage that would improve upon her own they were in short not only themselves to find a plausibility and an audacity but were somehow by the way to pick up these forms for her maggie as well and she felt indeed that she was giving them scant time longer when one afternoon in portland place she broke out with an irrelevance that was merely superficial what awfulness in heaven s name is there between them what do you believe what do you know oh if she went by faces her visitor s sudden whiteness at this might have carried her far fanny assingham turned pale for it but there was something in such an appearance in the look it put into the eyes that renewed maggie s conviction of what this companion had been expecting she had been watching it come come from afar and now that it was there after all and the first convulsion over they would doubtless soon find themselves in a more real relation it was there because of the sunday luncheon they had partaken of alone together it was there as strangely as one would because of the bad weather the cold perverse june rain that was making the day wrong it was there because it stood for the whole sum of the perplexities and duplicities among which our young woman felt herself lately to have picked her steps it was there because amerigo and charlotte were again paying together alone a week end visit which it had been maggie s plan infernally to promote just to see if this time they really would it was there because she had kept fanny on her side from paying one she would manifestly have been glad to pay and had made her come instead stupidly vacantly boringly to luncheon all in the spirit of celebrating the fact that the prince and mrs verver had thus put it into her own power to describe them exactly as they were it had abruptly occurred in truth that maggie required the preliminary help of determining how they were though on the other hand before her guest had answered her question everything in the hour and the place everything in all the conditions affected her as crying it out her guest s stare of ignorance above all that of itself at first cried it out between them what do you mean anything there shouldn t be there shouldn t have been all this time do you believe there is or what s your idea fanny s idea was clearly to begin with that her young friend had taken her breath away but she looked at her very straight and very hard do you speak from a suspicion of your own i speak at last from a torment forgive me if it comes out i ve been thinking for months and months and i ve no one to turn to no one to help me to make things out no impression but my own don t you see to go by you ve been thinking for months and months mrs assingham took it in but what then dear maggie have you been thinking well horrible things like a little beast that i perhaps am that there may be something something wrong and dreadful something they cover up the elder woman s colour had begun to come back she was able though with a visible effort to face the question less amazedly you imagine poor child that the wretches are in love is that it but maggie for a minute only stared back at her help me to find out what i imagine i don t know i ve nothing but my perpetual anxiety have you any do you see what i mean if you ll tell me truly that at least one way or the other will do something for me fanny s look had taken a peculiar gravity a fulness with which it seemed to shine is what it comes to that you re jealous of charlotte do you mean whether i hate her and maggie thought no not on account of father ah mrs assingham returned that isn t what one would suppose what i ask is if you re jealous on account of your husband well said maggie presently perhaps that may be all if i m unhappy i m jealous it must come to the same thing and with you at least i m not afraid of the word if i m jealous don t you see i m tormented she went on and all the more if i m helpless and if i m both helpless and tormented i stuff my pocket handkerchief into my mouth i keep it there for the most part night and day so as not to be heard too indecently moaning only now with you at last i can t keep it longer i ve pulled it out and here i am fairly screaming at you they re away she wound up so they can t hear and i m by a miracle of arrangement not at luncheon with father at home i live in the midst of miracles of arrangement half of which i admit are my own i go about on tiptoe i watch for every sound i feel every breath and yet i try all the while to seem as smooth as old satin dyed rose colour have you ever thought of me she asked as really feeling as i do her companion conspicuously required to be clear jealous unhappy tormented no said mrs assingham but at the same time and though you may laugh at me for it i m bound to confess that i ve never been so awfully sure of what i may call knowing you here you are indeed as you say such a deep little person i ve never imagined your existence poisoned and since you wish to know if i consider that it need be i ve not the least difficulty in speaking on the spot nothing decidedly strikes me as more unnecessary for a minute after this they remained face to face maggie had sprung up while her friend sat enthroned and after moving to and fro in her intensity now paused to receive the light she had invoked it had accumulated considerably by this time round mrs assingham s ample presence and it made even to our young woman s own sense a medium in which she could at last take a deeper breath i ve affected you these months and these last weeks in especial as quiet and natural and easy but it was a question that took not imperceptibly some answering you ve never affected me from the first hour i beheld you as anything but in a way all your own absolutely good and sweet and beautiful in a way as i say mrs assingham almost caressingly repeated just all your very own nobody else s at all i ve never thought of you but as outside of ugly things so ignorant of any falsity or cruelty or vulgarity as never to have to be touched by them or to touch them i ve never mixed you up with them there would have been time enough for that if they had seemed to be near you but they haven t if that s what you want to know you ve only believed me contented then because you ve believed me stupid mrs assingham had a free smile now for the length of this stride dissimulated though it might be in a graceful little frisk if i had believed you stupid i shouldn t have thought you interesting and if i hadn t thought you interesting i shouldn t have noted whether i knew you as i ve called it or not what i ve always been conscious of is your having concealed about you somewhere no small amount of character quite as much in fact fanny smiled as one could suppose a person of your size able to carry the only thing was she explained that thanks to your never calling one s attention to it i hadn t made out much more about it and should have been vague above all as to where you carried it or kept it somewhere under i should simply have said like that little silver cross you once showed me blest by the holy father that you always wear out of sight next your skin that relic i ve had a glimpse of with which she continued to invoke the privilege of humour but the precious little innermost say this time little golden personal nature of you blest by a greater power i think even than the pope that you ve never consentingly shown me i m not sure you ve ever consentingly shown it to anyone you ve been in general too modest maggie trying to follow almost achieved a little fold of her forehead i strike you as modest to day modest when i stand here and scream at you oh your screaming i ve granted you is something new i must fit it on somewhere the question is however mrs assingham further proceeded of what the deuce i can fit it on to do you mean she asked to the fact of our friends being from yesterday to to morrow at a place where they may more or less irresponsibly meet she spoke with the air of putting it as badly for them as possible are you thinking of their being there alone of their having consented to be and then as she had waited without result for her companion to say but isn t it true that after you had this time again at the eleventh hour said you wouldn t they would really much rather not have gone yes they would certainly much rather not have gone but i wanted them to go then my dear child what in the world is the matter i wanted to see if they would and they ve had to maggie added it was the only thing her friend appeared to wonder from the moment you and your father backed out oh i don t mean go for those people i mean go for us for father and me maggie went on because now they know they know fanny assingham quavered that i ve been for some time past taking more notice notice of the queer things in our life maggie saw her companion for an instant on the point of asking her what these queer things might be but mrs assingham had the next minute brushed by that ambiguous opening and taken as she evidently felt a better one and is it for that you did it i mean gave up the visit it s for that i did it to leave them to themselves as they less and less want or at any rate less and less venture to appear to want to be left as they had for so long arranged things the princess went on you see they sometimes have to be and then as if baffled by the lucidity of this mrs assingham for a little said nothing now do you think i m modest with time however fanny could brilliantly think anything that would serve i think you re wrong that my dear is my answer to your question it demands assuredly the straightest i can make i see no awfulness i suspect none i m deeply distressed she added that you should do anything else it drew again from maggie a long look you ve never even imagined anything ah god forbid for it s exactly as a woman of imagination that i speak there s no moment of my life at which i m not imagining something and it s thanks to that darling mrs assingham pursued that i figure the sincerity with which your husband whom you see as viciously occupied with your stepmother is interested is tenderly interested in his admirable adorable wife she paused a minute as to give her friend the full benefit of this as to maggie s measure of which however no sign came and then poor woman haplessly she crowned her effort he wouldn t hurt a hair of your head it had produced in maggie at once and apparently in the intended form of a smile the most extraordinary expression ah there it is but her guest had already gone on and i m absolutely certain that charlotte wouldn t either it kept the princess with her strange grimace standing there no charlotte wouldn t either that s how they ve had again to go off together they ve been afraid not to lest it should disturb me aggravate me somehow work upon me as i insisted that they must that we couldn t all fail though father and charlotte hadn t really accepted as i did this they had to yield to the fear that their showing as afraid to move together would count for them as the greater danger which would be the danger you see of my feeling myself wronged their least danger they know is in going on with all the things that i ve seemed to accept and that i ve given no indication at any moment of not accepting everything that has come up for them has come up in an extraordinary manner without my having by a sound or a sign given myself away so that it s all as wonderful as you may conceive they move at any rate among the dangers i speak of between that of their doing too much and that of their not having any longer the confidence or the nerve or whatever you may call it to do enough her tone by this time might have shown a strangeness to match her smile which was still more marked as she wound up and that s how i make them do what i like it had an effect on mrs assingham who rose with the deliberation that from point to point marked the widening of her grasp my dear child you re amazing amazing you re terrible maggie thoughtfully shook her head no i m not terrible and you don t think me so i do strike you as surprising no doubt but surprisingly mild because don t you see i am mild i can bear anything oh bear mrs assingham fluted for love said the princess fanny hesitated of your father for love maggie repeated it kept her friend watching of your husband for love maggie said again it was for the moment as if the distinctness of this might have determined in her companion a choice between two or three highly different alternatives mrs assingham s rejoinder at all events however much or however little it was a choice was presently a triumph speaking with this love of your own then have you undertaken to convey to me that you believe your husband and your father s wife to be in act and in fact lovers of each other and then as the princess didn t at first answer do you call such an allegation as that mild oh i m not pretending to be mild to you but i ve told you and moreover you must have seen for yourself how much so i ve been to them mrs assingham more brightly again bridled is that what you call it when you make them for terror as you say do as you like ah there wouldn t be any terror for them if they had nothing to hide mrs assingham faced her quite steady now are you really conscious love of what you re saying i m saying that i m bewildered and tormented and that i ve no one but you to speak to i ve thought i ve in fact been sure that you ve seen for yourself how much this is the case it s why i ve believed you would meet me half way half way to what to denouncing fanny asked two persons friends of years whom i ve always immensely admired and liked and against whom i haven t the shadow of a charge to make maggie looked at her with wide eyes i had much rather you should denounce me than denounce them denounce me denounce me she said if you can see your way it was exactly what she appeared to have argued out with herself if conscientiously you can denounce me if conscientiously you can revile me if conscientiously you can put me in my place for a low minded little pig well said mrs assingham consideringly as she paused for emphasis i think i shall be saved her friend took it for a minute however by carrying thoughtful eyes eyes verily portentous over her head you say you ve no one to speak to and you make a point of your having so disguised your feelings not having as you call it given yourself away have you then never seen it not only as your right but as your bounden duty worked up to such a pitch to speak to your husband i ve spoken to him said maggie mrs assingham stared ah then it isn t true that you ve made no sign maggie had a silence i ve made no trouble i ve made no scene i ve taken no stand i ve neither reproached nor accused him you ll say there s a way in all that of being nasty enough oh dropped from fanny as if she couldn t help it but i don t think strangely enough that he regards me as nasty i think that at bottom for that is said the princess the strangeness he s sorry for me yes i think that deep within he pities me her companion wondered for the state you ve let yourself get into for not being happy when i ve so much to make me so you ve everything said mrs assingham with alacrity yet she remained for an instant embarrassed as to a further advance i don t understand however how if you ve done nothing an impatience from maggie had checked her i ve not done absolutely nothing but what then well she went on after a minute he knows what i ve done it produced on mrs assingham s part her whole tone and manner exquisitely aiding a hush not less prolonged and the very duration of which inevitably gave it something of the character of an equal recognition and what then has he done maggie took again a minute he has been splendid splendid then what more do you want ah what you see said maggie not to be afraid it made her guest again hang fire not to be afraid really to speak not to be afraid not to speak mrs assingham considered further you can t even to charlotte but as at this after a look at her maggie turned off with a movement of suppressed despair she checked herself and might have been watching her for all the difficulty and the pity of it vaguely moving to the window and the view of the hill street it was almost as if she had had to give up from failure of responsive wit in her friend the last failure she had feared the hope of the particular relief she had been working for mrs assingham resumed the next instant however in the very tone that seemed most to promise her she should have to give up nothing i see i see you would have in that case too many things to consider it brought the princess round again proving itself thus the note of comprehension she wished most to clutch at don t be afraid maggie took it where she stood which she was soon able to signify thank you it very properly encouraged her counsellor what your idea imputes is a criminal intrigue carried on from day to day amid perfect trust and sympathy not only under your eyes but under your father s that s an idea it s impossible for me for a moment to entertain ah there you are then it s exactly what i wanted from you you re welcome to it mrs assingham breathed you never have entertained it maggie pursued never for an instant said fanny with her head very high maggie took it again yet again as wanting more pardon my being so horrid but by all you hold sacred mrs assingham faced her ah my dear upon my positive word as an honest woman thank you then said the princess so they remained a little after which but do you believe it love fanny inquired i believe you well as i ve faith in them it comes to the same thing maggie at this last appeared for a moment to think again but she embraced the proposition the same thing then you re no longer unhappy her guest urged coming more gaily toward her i doubtless shan t be a great while but it was now mrs assingham s turn to want more i ve convinced you it s impossible she had held out her arms and maggie after a moment meeting her threw herself into them with a sound that had its oddity as a sign of relief impossible impossible she emphatically more than emphatically replied yet the next minute she had burst into tears over the impossibility and a few seconds later pressing clinging sobbing had even caused them to flow audibly sympathetically and perversely from her friend xxxi the understanding appeared to have come to be that the colonel and his wife were to present themselves toward the middle of july for the good long visit at fawns on which maggie had obtained from her father that he should genially insist as well as that the couple from eaton square should welcome there earlier in the month and less than a week after their own arrival the advent of the couple from portland place oh we shall give you time to breathe fanny remarked in reference to the general prospect with a gaiety that announced itself as heedless of criticism to each member of the party in turn sustaining and bracing herself by her emphasis pushed even to an amiable cynicism of the confident view of these punctualities of the assinghams the ground she could best occupy to her sense was that of her being moved as in this connexion she had always been moved by the admitted grossness of her avidity the way the hospitality of the ververs met her convenience and ministered to her ease destitute as the colonel had kept her from the first of any rustic retreat any leafy bower of her own any fixed base for the stale season now at hand she had explained at home she had repeatedly reexplained the terms of her dilemma the real difficulty of her or as she now put it of their position when the pair could do nothing else in cadogan place they could still talk of marvellous little maggie and of the charm the sinister charm of their having to hold their breath to watch her a topic the momentous midnight discussion at which we have been present was so far from having exhausted it came up irrepressibly at all private hours they had planted it there between them and it grew from day to day in a manner to make their sense of responsibility almost yield to their sense of fascination mrs assingham declared at such moments that in the interest of this admirable young thing to whom she also declared she had quite come over she was ready to pass with all the world else even with the prince himself the object inconsequently as well of her continued her explicitly shameless appreciation for a vulgar indelicate pestilential woman showing her true character in an abandoned old age the colonel s confessed attention had been enlisted we have seen as never yet under pressure from his wife by any guaranteed imbroglio but this she could assure him she perfectly knew was not a bit because he was sorry for her or touched by what she had let herself in for but because when once they had been opened he couldn t keep his eyes from resting complacently resting almost intelligently on the princess if he was in love with her now however so much the better it would help them both not to wince at what they would have to do for her mrs assingham had come back to that whenever he groaned or grunted she had at no beguiled moment since maggie s little march was positively beguiling let him lose sight of the grim necessity awaiting them we shall have as i ve again and again told you to lie for her to lie till we re black in the face to lie for her the colonel often at these hours as from a vague vision of old chivalry in a new form wandered into apparent lapses from lucidity to lie to her up and down and in and out it comes to the same thing it will consist just as much of lying to the others too to the prince about one s belief in him to charlotte about one s belief in her to mr verver dear sweet man about one s belief in everyone so we ve work cut out with the biggest lie on top of all being that we like to be there for such a purpose we hate it unspeakably i m more ready to be a coward before it to let the whole thing to let everyone selfishly and pusillanimously slide than before any social duty any felt human call that has ever forced me to be decent i speak at least for myself for you she had added as i ve given you so perfect an opportunity to fall in love with maggie you ll doubtless find your account in being so much nearer to her and what do you make the colonel could at this always imperturbably enough ask of the account you yourself will find in being so much nearer to the prince of your confirmed if not exasperated infatuation with whom to say nothing of my weak good nature about it you give such a pretty picture to the picture in question she had been always in fact able contemplatively to return the difficulty of my enjoyment of that is don t you see that i m making in my loyalty to maggie a sad hash of his affection for me you find means to call it then this whitewashing of his crime being loyal to maggie oh about that particular crime there is always much to say it is always more interesting to us than any other crime it has at least that for it but of course i call everything i have in mind at all being loyal to maggie being loyal to her is more than anything else helping her with her father which is what she most wants and needs the colonel had had it before but he could apparently never have too much of it helping her with him helping her against him then against what we ve already so fully talked of its having to be recognised between them that he doubts that s where my part is so plain to see her through to see her through to the end exaltation for the moment always lighted mrs assingham s reference to this plainness yet she at the same time seldom failed the next instant to qualify her view of it when i talk of my obligation as clear i mean that it s absolute for just how from day to day and through thick and thin to keep the thing up is i grant you another matter there s one way luckily nevertheless in which i m strong i can perfectly count on her the colonel seldom failed here as from the insidious growth of an excitement to wonder to encourage not to see you re lying to stick to me fast whatever she sees if i stick to her that is to my own poor struggling way under providence of watching over them all she ll stand by me to the death she won t give me away for you know she easily can this regularly was the most lurid turn of their road but bob assingham with each journey met it as for the first time easily she can utterly dishonour me with her father she can let him know that i was aware at the time of his marriage as i had been aware at the time of her own of the relations that had pre existed between his wife and her husband and how can she do so if up to this minute by your own statement she is herself in ignorance of your knowledge it was a question that mrs assingham had ever for dealing with a manner to which repeated practice had given almost a grand effect very much as if she was invited by it to say that about this exactly she proposed to do her best lying but she said and with full lucidity something quite other it could give itself a little the air still of a triumph over his coarseness by acting immediately with the blind resentment with which in her place ninety nine women out of a hundred would act and by so making mr verver in turn act with the same natural passion the passion of ninety nine men out of a hundred they ve only to agree about me the poor lady said they ve only to feel at one over it feel bitterly practised upon cheated and injured they ve only to denounce me to each other as false and infamous for me to be quite irretrievably dished of course it s i who have been and who continue to be cheated cheated by the prince and charlotte but they re not obliged to give me the benefit of that or to give either of us the benefit of anything they ll be within their rights to lump us all together as a false cruel conspiring crew and if they can find the right facts to support them get rid of us root and branch this on each occasion put the matter so at the worst that repetition even scarce controlled the hot flush with which she was compelled to see the parts of the whole history all its ugly consistency and its temporary gloss hang together she enjoyed invariably the sense of making her danger present of making it real to her husband and of his almost turning pale when their eyes met at this possibility of their compromised state and their shared discredit the beauty was that as under a touch of one of the ivory notes at the left of the keyboard he sounded out with the short sharpness of the dear fond stupid uneasy man conspiring so far as you were concerned to what end why to the obvious end of getting the prince a wife at maggie s expense and then to that of getting charlotte a husband at mr verver s of rendering friendly services yes which have produced as it turns out complications but from the moment you didn t do it for the complications why shouldn t you have rendered them it was extraordinary for her always in this connexion how with time given him he fell to speaking better for her than she could in the presence of her clear cut image of the worst speak for herself troubled as she was she thus never wholly failed of her amusement by the way oh isn t what i may have meddled for so far as it can be proved i did meddle open to interpretation by which i mean to mr verver s and maggie s mayn t they see my motive in the light of that appreciation as the wish to be decidedly more friendly to the others than to the victimised father and daughter she positively liked to keep it up mayn t they see my motive as the determination to serve the prince in any case and at any price first to place him comfortably in other words to find him his fill of money mayn t it have all the air for them of a really equivocal sinister bargain between us something quite unholy and louche it produced in the poor colonel infallibly the echo louche love why haven t you said as much yourself haven t you put your finger on that awful possibility she had a way now with his felicities that made him enjoy being reminded of them in speaking of your having always had such a mash such a mash precisely for the man i was to help to put so splendidly at his ease a motherly mash an impartial look at it would show it only as likely to have been but we re not talking of course about impartial looks we re talking of good innocent people deeply worked upon by a horrid discovery and going much further in their view of the lurid as such people almost always do than those who have been wider awake all round from the first what i was to have got from my friend in such a view in exchange for what i had been able to do for him well that would have been an equivalent of a kind best known to myself for me shrewdly to consider and she easily lost herself each time in the anxious satisfaction of filling out the picture it would have been seen it would have been heard of before the case of the woman a man doesn t want or of whom he s tired or for whom he has no use but such uses and who is capable in her infatuation in her passion of promoting his interests with other women rather than lose sight of him lose touch of him cease to have to do with him at all cela s est vu my dear and stranger things still as i needn t tell you very good then she wound up there is a perfectly possible conception of the behaviour of your sweet wife since as i say there s no imagination so lively once it s started as that of really agitated lambs lions are nothing to them for lions are sophisticated are blases are brought up from the first to prowling and mauling it does give us you ll admit something to think about my relief is luckily however in what i finally do think he was well enough aware by this time of what she finally did think but he was not without a sense again also for his amusement by the way it would have made him for a spectator of these passages between the pair resemble not a little the artless child who hears his favourite story told for the twentieth time and enjoys it exactly because he knows what is next to happen what of course will pull them up if they turn out to have less imagination than you assume is the profit you can have found in furthering mrs verver s marriage you weren t at least in love with charlotte oh mrs assingham at this always brought out my hand in that is easily accounted for by my desire to be agreeable to him to mr verver to the prince by preventing her in that way from taking as he was in danger of seeing her do some husband with whom he wouldn t be able to open to keep open so large an account as with his father in law i ve brought her near him kept her within his reach as she could never have remained either as a single woman or as the wife of a different man kept her on that sweet construction to be his mistress kept her on that sweet construction to be his mistress she brought it out grandly it had always so for her own ear as well as visibly for her husband s its effect the facilities in the case thanks to the particular conditions being so quite ideal down even to the facility of your minding everything so little from your own point of view as to have supplied him with the enjoyment of two beautiful women down even to that to the monstrosity of my folly but not mrs assingham added two of anything one beautiful woman and one beautiful fortune that s what a creature of pure virtue exposes herself to when she suffers her pure virtue suffers her sympathy her disinterestedness her exquisite sense for the lives of others to carry her too far voila i see it s the way the ververs have you it s the way the ververs have me it s in other words the way they would be able to make such a show to each other of having me if maggie weren t so divine she lets you off he never failed to insist on all this to the very end which was how he had become so versed in what she finally thought she lets me off so that now horrified and contrite at what i ve done i may work to help her out and mr verver she was fond of adding lets me off too then you do believe he knows it determined in her always there with a significant pause a deep immersion in her thought i believe he would let me off if he did know so that i might work to help him out or rather really she went on that i might work to help maggie that would be his motive that would be his condition in forgiving me just as hers for me in fact her motive and her condition are my acting to spare her father but it s with maggie only that i m directly concerned nothing ever not a breath not a look i ll guarantee shall i have whatever happens from mr verver himself so it is therefore that i shall probably by the closest possible shave escape the penalty of my crimes you mean being held responsible i mean being held responsible my advantage will be that maggie s such a trump such a trump that as you say she ll stick to you stick to me on our understanding stick to me for our understanding s signed and sealed and to brood over it again was ever for mrs assingham to break out again with exaltation it s a grand high compact she has solemnly promised but in words oh yes in words enough since it s a matter of words to keep up her lie so long as i keep up mine and what do you call her lie why the pretence that she believes me believes they re innocent she positively believes then they re guilty she has arrived at that she s really content with it in the absence of proof it was here each time that fanny assingham most faltered but always at last to get the matter for her own sense and with a long sigh sufficiently straight it isn t a question of belief or of proof absent or present it s inevitably with her a question of natural perception of insurmountable feeling she irresistibly knows that there s something between them but she hasn t arrived at it as you say at all that s exactly what she hasn t done what she so steadily and intensely refuses to do she stands off and off so as not to arrive she keeps out to sea and away from the rocks and what she most wants of me is to keep at a safe distance with her as i for my own skin only ask not to come nearer after which invariably she let him have it all so far from wanting proof which she must get in a manner by my siding with her she wants disproof as against herself and has appealed to me so extraordinarily to side against her it s really magnificent when you come to think of it the spirit of her appeal if i ll but cover them up brazenly enough the others so as to show round and about them as happy as a bird she on her side will do what she can if i ll keep them quiet in a word it will enable her to gain time time as against any idea of her father s and so somehow come out if i ll take care of charlotte in particular she ll take care of the prince and it s beautiful and wonderful really pathetic and exquisite to see what she feels that time may do for her ah but what does she call poor little thing time well this summer at fawns to begin with she can live as yet of course but from hand to mouth but she has worked it out for herself i think that the very danger of fawns superficially looked at may practically amount to a greater protection there the lovers if they are lovers will have to mind they ll feel it for themselves unless things are too utterly far gone with them and things are not too utterly far gone with them she had inevitably poor woman her hesitation for this but she put down her answer as for the purchase of some absolutely indispensable article she would have put down her last shilling no it made him always grin at her is that a lie do you think you re worth lying to if it weren t the truth for me she added i wouldn t have accepted for fawns i can i believe keep the wretches quiet but how at the worst oh the worst don t talk about the worst i can keep them quiet at the best i seem to feel simply by our being there it will work from week to week of itself you ll see he was willing enough to see but he desired to provide yet if it doesn t work ah that s talking about the worst well it might be but what were they doing from morning to night at this crisis but talk who ll keep the others the others who ll keep them quiet if your couple have had a life together they can t have had it completely without witnesses without the help of persons however few who must have some knowledge some idea about them they ve had to meet secretly protectedly they ve had to arrange for if they haven t met and haven t arranged and haven t thereby in some quarter or other had to give themselves away why are we piling it up so therefore if there s evidence up and down london there must be people in possession of it ah it isn t all she always remembered up and down london some of it must connect them i mean she musingly added it naturally would with other places with who knows what strange adventures opportunities dissimulations but whatever there may have been it will also all have been buried on the spot oh they ve known how too beautifully but nothing all the same is likely to find its way to maggie of itself because every one who may have anything to tell you hold will have been so squared and then inveterately before she could say he enjoyed so much coming to this what will have squared lady castledean the consciousness she had never lost her promptness of having no stones to throw at any one else s windows she has enough to do to guard her own glass that was what she was doing fanny said that last morning at matcham when all of us went off and she kept the prince and charlotte over she helped them simply that she might herself be helped if it wasn t perhaps rather with her ridiculous mr blint that he might be they put in together therefore of course that day they got it clear and quite under her eyes inasmuch as they didn t become traceable again as we know till late in the evening on this historic circumstance mrs assingham was always ready afresh to brood but she was no less ready after her brooding devoutly to add only we know nothing whatever else for which all our stars be thanked the colonel s gratitude was apt to be less marked what did they do for themselves all the same from the moment they got that free hand to the moment long after dinner time haven t you told me of their turning up at their respective homes well it s none of your business i don t speak of it as mine but it s only too much theirs people are always traceable in england when tracings are required something sooner or later happens somebody sooner or later breaks the holy calm murder will out murder will but this isn t murder quite the contrary perhaps i verily believe she had her moments of adding that for the amusement of the row you would prefer an explosion this however was a remark he seldom noticed he wound up for the most part after a long contemplative smoke with a transition from which no exposed futility in it had succeeded in weaning him what i can t for my life make out is your idea of the old boy charlotte s too inconceivably funny husband i have no idea i beg your pardon you ve just shown it you never speak of him but as too inconceivably funny well he is she always confessed that is he may be for all i know too inconceivably great but that s not an idea it represents only my weak necessity of feeling that he s beyond me which isn t an idea either you see he may be stupid too precisely there you are yet on the other hand she always went on he may be sublime sublimer even than maggie herself he may in fact have already been but we shall never know with which her tone betrayed perhaps a shade of soreness for the single exemption she didn t yearningly welcome that i can see oh i say it came to affect the colonel himself with a sense of privation i m not sure even that charlotte will oh my dear what charlotte doesn t know but she brooded and brooded i m not sure even that the prince will it seemed privation in short for them all they ll be mystified confounded tormented but they won t know and all their possible putting their heads together won t make them that said fanny assingham will be their punishment and she ended ever when she had come so far at the same pitch it will probably also if i get off with so little be mine and what her husband liked to ask will be mine nothing you re not worthy of any one s punishment is in what one feels and what will make ours effective is that we shall feel she was splendid with her ours she flared up with this prophecy it will be maggie herself who will mete it out maggie she ll know about her father everything everything she repeated on the vision of which each time mrs assingham as with the presentiment of an odd despair turned away from it but she ll never tell us xxxii if maggie had not so firmly made up her mind never to say either to her good friend or to any one else more than she meant about her father she might have found herself betrayed into some such overflow during the week spent in london with her husband after the others had adjourned to fawns for the summer this was because of the odd element of the unnatural imparted to the so simple fact of their brief separation by the assumptions resident in their course of life hitherto she was used herself certainly by this time to dealing with odd elements but she dropped instantly even from such peace as she had patched up when it was a question of feeling that her unpenetrated parent might be alone with them she thought of him as alone with them when she thought of him as alone with charlotte and this strangely enough even while fixing her sense to the full on his wife s power of preserving quite of enhancing every felicitous appearance charlotte had done that under immeasurably fewer difficulties indeed during the numerous months of their hymeneal absence from england the period prior to that wonderful reunion of the couples in the interest of the larger play of all the virtues of each which was now bearing for mrs verver s stepdaughter at least such remarkable fruit it was the present so much briefer interval in a situation possibly in a relation so changed it was the new terms of her problem that would tax charlotte s art the princess could pull herself up repeatedly by remembering that the real relation between her father and his wife was a thing that she knew nothing about and that in strictness was none of her business but she none the less failed to keep quiet as she would have called it before the projected image of their ostensibly happy isolation nothing could have had less of the quality of quietude than a certain queer wish that fitfully flickered up in her a wish that usurped perversely the place of a much more natural one if charlotte while she was about it could only have been worse that idea maggie fell to invoking instead of the idea that she might desirably have been better for exceedingly odd as it was to feel in such ways she believed she mightn t have worried so much if she didn t somehow make her stepmother out under the beautiful trees and among the dear old gardens as lavish of fifty kinds of confidence and twenty kinds at least of gentleness gentleness and confidence were certainly the right thing as from a charming woman to her husband but the fine tissue of reassurance woven by this lady s hands and flung over her companion as a light muffling veil formed precisely a wrought transparency through which she felt her father s eyes continually rest on herself the reach of his gaze came to her straighter from a distance it showed him as still more conscious down there alone of the suspected the felt elaboration of the process of their not alarming or hurting him she had herself now for weeks and weeks and all unwinkingly traced the extension of this pious effort but her perfect success in giving no sign she did herself that credit would have been an achievement quite wasted if mrs verver should make with him those mistakes of proportion one set of them too abruptly too incoherently designed to correct another set that she had made with his daughter however if she had been worse poor woman who should say that her husband would to a certainty have been better one groped noiselessly among such questions and it was actually not even definite for the princess that her own amerigo left alone with her in town had arrived at the golden mean of non precautionary gallantry which would tend by his calculation to brush private criticism from its last perching place the truth was in this connection that she had different sorts of terrors and there were hours when it came to her that these days were a prolonged repetition of that night drive of weeks before from the other house to their own when he had tried to charm her by his sovereign personal power into some collapse that would commit her to a repudiation of consistency she was never alone with him it was to be said without her having sooner or later to ask herself what had already become of her consistency yet at the same time so long as she breathed no charge she kept hold of a remnant of appearance that could save her from attack attack real attack from him as he would conduct it was what she above all dreaded she was so far from sure that under that experience she mightn t drop into some depth of weakness mightn t show him some shortest way with her that he would know how to use again therefore since she had given him as yet no moment s pretext for pretending to her that she had either lost faith or suffered by a feather s weight in happiness she left him it was easy to reason with an immense advantage for all waiting and all tension she wished him for the present to make up to her for nothing who could say to what making up might lead into what consenting or pretending or destroying blindness it might plunge her she loved him too helplessly still to dare to open the door by an inch to his treating her as if either of them had wronged the other something or somebody and who at this which of them all would inevitably would in the gust of momentary selfishness be sacrificed to that whereas what she intelligently needed was to know where she was going knowledge knowledge was a fascination as well as a fear and a part precisely of the strangeness of this juncture was the way her apprehension that he would break out to her with some merely general profession was mixed with her dire need to forgive him to reassure him to respond to him on no ground that she didn t fully measure to do these things it must be clear to her what they were for but to act in that light was by the same effect to learn horribly what the other things had been he might tell her only what he wanted only what would work upon her by the beauty of his appeal and the result of the direct appeal of any beauty in him would be her helpless submission to his terms all her temporary safety her hand to mouth success accordingly was in his neither perceiving nor divining this thanks to such means as she could take to prevent him take literally from hour to hour during these days of more unbroken exposure from hour to hour she fairly expected some sign of his having decided on a jump ah yes it has been as you think i ve strayed away i ve fancied myself free given myself in other quantities with larger generosities because i thought you were different different from what i now see but it was only only because i didn t know and you must admit that you gave me scarce reason enough reason enough i mean to keep clear of my mistake to which i confess for which i ll do exquisite penance which you can help me now i too beautifully feel to get completely over that was what while she watched herself she potentially heard him bring out and while she carried to an end another day another sequence and yet another of their hours together without his producing it she felt herself occupied with him beyond even the intensity of surrender she was keeping her head for a reason for a cause and the labour of this detachment with the labour of her keeping the pitch of it down held them together in the steel hoop of an intimacy compared with which artless passion would have been but a beating of the air her greatest danger or at least her greatest motive for care was the obsession of the thought that if he actually did suspect the fruit of his attention to her couldn t help being a sense of the growth of her importance taking the measure with him as she had taken it with her father of the prescribed reach of her hypocrisy she saw how it would have to stretch even to her seeking to prove that she was not all the same important a single touch from him oh she should know it in case of its coming any brush of his hand of his lips of his voice inspired by recognition of her probable interest as distinct from pity for her virtual gloom would hand her over to him bound hand and foot therefore to be free to be free to act other than abjectly for her father she must conceal from him the validity that like a microscopic insect pushing a grain of sand she was taking on even for herself she could keep it up with a change in sight but she couldn t keep it up forever so that really one extraordinary effect of their week of untempered confrontation which bristled with new marks was to make her reach out in thought to their customary companions and calculate the kind of relief that rejoining them would bring she was learning almost from minute to minute to be a mistress of shades since always when there were possibilities enough of intimacy there were also by that fact in intercourse possibilities of iridescence but she was working against an adversary who was a master of shades too and on whom if she didn t look out she should presently have imposed a consciousness of the nature of their struggle to feel him in fact to think of his feeling himself her adversary in things of this fineness to see him at all in short brave a name that would represent him as in opposition was already to be nearly reduced to a visible smothering of her cry of alarm should he guess they were having in their so occult manner a high fight and that it was she all the while in her supposed stupidity who had made it high and was keeping it high in the event of his doing this before they could leave town she should verily be lost the possible respite for her at fawns would come from the fact that observation in him there would inevitably find some of its directness diverted this would be the case if only because the remarkable strain of her father s placidity might be thought of as likely to claim some larger part of his attention besides which there would be always charlotte herself to draw him off charlotte would help him again doubtless to study anything right or left that might be symptomatic but maggie could see that this very fact might perhaps contribute in its degree to protect the secret of her own fermentation it is not even incredible that she may have discovered the gleam of a comfort that was to broaden in the conceivable effect on the prince s spirit on his nerves on his finer irritability of some of the very airs and aspects the light graces themselves of mrs verver s too perfect competence what it would most come to after all she said to herself was a renewal for him of the privilege of watching that lady watch her very well then with the elements after all so mixed in him how long would he go on enjoying mere spectatorship of that act for she had by this time made up her mind that in charlotte s company he deferred to charlotte s easier art of mounting guard wouldn t he get tired to put it only at that of seeing her always on the rampart erect and elegant with her lace flounced parasol now folded and now shouldered march to and fro against a gold coloured east or west maggie had gone far truly for a view of the question of this particular reaction and she was not incapable of pulling herself up with the rebuke that she counted her chickens before they were hatched how sure she should have to be of so many things before she might thus find a weariness in amerigo s expression and a logic in his weariness one of her dissimulated arts for meeting their tension meanwhile was to interweave mrs assingham as plausibly as possible with the undulations of their surface to bring it about that she should join them of an afternoon when they drove together or if they went to look at things looking at things being almost as much a feature of their life as if they were bazaar opening royalties then there were such combinations later in the day as her attendance on them and the colonel s as well for such whimsical matters as visits to the opera no matter who was singing and sudden outbreaks of curiosity about the british drama the good couple from cadogan place could always unprotestingly dine with them and go on afterwards to such publicities as the princess cultivated the boldness of now perversely preferring it may be said of her that during these passages she plucked her sensations by the way detached nervously the small wild blossoms of her dim forest so that she could smile over them at least with the spacious appearance for her companions for her husband above all of bravely of altogether frivolously going a maying she had her intense her smothered excitements some of which were almost inspirations she had in particular the extravagant positively at moments the amused sense of using her friend to the topmost notch accompanied with the high luxury of not having to explain never no never should she have to explain to fanny assingham again who poor woman on her own side would be charged it might be forever with that privilege of the higher ingenuity she put it all off on fanny and the dear thing herself might henceforth appraise the quantity more and more magnificent now in her blameless egoism maggie asked no questions of her and thus only signified the greatness of the opportunity she gave her she didn t care for what devotions what dinners of their own the assinghams might have been booked that was a detail and she could think without wincing of the ruptures and rearrangements to which her service condemned them it all fell in beautifully moreover so that as hard at this time in spite of her fever as a little pointed diamond the princess showed something of the glitter of consciously possessing the constructive the creative hand she had but to have the fancy of presenting herself of presenting her husband in a certain high and convenient manner to make it natural they should go about with their gentleman and their lady to what else but this exactly had charlotte during so many weeks of the earlier season worked her up herself assuming and discharging so far as might be the character and office of one of those revolving subordinate presences that float in the wake of greatness the precedent was therefore established and the group normally constituted mrs assingham meanwhile at table on the stairs in the carriage or the opera box might with her constant overflow of expression for that matter and its singularly resident character where men in especial were concerned look across at amerigo in whatever sense she liked it was not of that maggie proposed to be afraid she might warn him she might rebuke him she might reassure him she might if it were impossible not to absolutely make love to him even this was open to her as a matter simply between them if it would help her to answer for the impeccability he had guaranteed and maggie desired in fact only to strike her as acknowledging the efficacy of her aid when she mentioned to her one evening a small project for the morrow privately entertained the idea irresistible intense of going to pay at the museum a visit to mr crichton mr crichton as mrs assingham could easily remember was the most accomplished and obliging of public functionaries whom every one knew and who knew every one who had from the first in particular lent himself freely and for the love of art and history to becoming one of the steadier lights of mr verver s adventurous path the custodian of one of the richest departments of the great national collection of precious things he could feel for the sincere private collector and urge him on his way even when condemned to be present at his capture of trophies sacrificed by the country to parliamentary thrift he carried his amiability to the point of saying that since london under pettifogging views had to miss from time to time its rarest opportunities he was almost consoled to see such lost causes invariably wander at last one by one with the tormenting tinkle of their silver bells into the wondrous the already famous fold beyond the mississippi there was a charm in his almosts that was not to be resisted especially after mr verver and maggie had grown sure or almost again of enjoying the monopoly of them and on this basis of envy changed to sympathy by the more familiar view of the father and the daughter mr crichton had at both houses though especially in eaton square learned to fill out the responsive and suggestive character it was at his invitation fanny well recalled that maggie one day long before and under her own attendance precisely had for the glory of the name she bore paid a visit to one of the ampler shrines of the supreme exhibitory temple an alcove of shelves charged with the gold and brown gold and ivory of old italian bindings and consecrated to the records of the prince s race it had been an impression that penetrated that remained yet maggie had sighed ever so prettily at its having to be so superficial she was to go back some day to dive deeper to linger and taste in spite of which however mrs assingham could not recollect perceiving that the visit had been repeated this second occasion had given way for a long time in her happy life to other occasions all testifying in their degree to the quality of her husband s blood its rich mixture and its many remarkable references after which no doubt the charming piety involved had grown on still further grounds bewildered and faint it now appeared none the less that some renewed conversation with mr crichton had breathed on the faintness revivingly and maggie mentioned her purpose as a conception of her very own to the success of which she designed to devote her morning visits of gracious ladies under his protection lighted up rosily for this perhaps most flower loving and honey sipping member of the great bloomsbury hive its packed passages and cells and though not sworn of the province toward which his friend had found herself according to her appeal to him yearning again nothing was easier for him than to put her in relation with the presiding urbanities so it had been settled maggie said to mrs assingham and she was to dispense with amerigo s company fanny was to remember later on that she had at first taken this last fact for one of the finer notes of her young woman s detachment imagined she must be going alone because of the shade of irony that in these ambiguous days her husband s personal presence might be felt to confer practically on any tribute to his transmitted significance then as the next moment she felt it clear that so much plotted freedom was virtually a refinement of reflection an impulse to commemorate afresh whatever might still survive of pride and hope her sense of ambiguity happily fell and she congratulated her companion on having anything so exquisite to do and on being so exquisitely in the humour to do it after the occasion had come and gone she was confirmed in her optimism she made out in the evening that the hour spent among the projected lights the annals and illustrations the parchments and portraits the emblazoned volumes and the murmured commentary had been for the princess enlarging and inspiring maggie had said to her some days before very sweetly but very firmly invite us to dine please for friday and have any one you like or you can it doesn t in the least matter whom and the pair in cadogan place had bent to this mandate with a docility not in the least ruffled by all that it took for granted it provided for an evening this had been maggie s view and she lived up to her view in her friend s eyes by treating the occasion more or less explicitly as new and strange the good assinghams had feasted in fact at the two other boards on a scale so disproportionate to the scant solicitations of their own that it was easy to make a joke of seeing how they fed at home how they met themselves the question of giving to eat maggie dined with them in short and arrived at making her husband appear to dine much in the manner of a pair of young sovereigns who have in the frolic humour of the golden years of reigns proposed themselves to a pair of faithfully serving subjects she showed an interest in their arrangements an inquiring tenderness almost for their economies so that her hostess not unnaturally as they might have said put it all down the tone and the freedom of which she set the example to the effect wrought in her afresh by one of the lessons learned in the morning at the altar of the past hadn t she picked it up from an anecdote or two offered again to her attention that there were for princesses of such a line more ways than one of being a heroine maggie s way to night was to surprise them all truly by the extravagance of her affability she was doubtless not positively boisterous yet though mrs assingham as a bland critic had never doubted her being graceful she had never seen her put so much of it into being what might have been called assertive it was all a tune to which fanny s heart could privately palpitate her guest was happy happy as a consequence of something that had occurred but she was making the prince not lose a ripple of her laugh though not perhaps always enabling him to find it absolutely not foolish foolish in public beyond a certain point he was scarce the man to brook his wife s being thought to be so that there hovered before their friend the possibility of some subsequent scene between them in the carriage or at home of slightly sarcastic inquiry of promptly invited explanation a scene that according as maggie should play her part in it might or might not precipitate developments what made these appearances practically thrilling meanwhile was this mystery a mystery it was clear to amerigo himself of the incident or the influence that had so peculiarly determined them the lady of cadogan place was to read deeper however within three days and the page was turned for her on the eve of her young confidant s leaving london the awaited migration to fawns was to take place on the morrow and it was known meanwhile to mrs assingham that their party of four were to dine that night at the american embassy with another and a larger party so that the elder woman had a sense of surprise on receiving from the younger under date of six o clock a telegram requesting her immediate attendance please come to me at once dress early if necessary so that we shall have time the carriage ordered for us will take you back first mrs assingham on quick deliberation dressed though not perhaps with full lucidity and by seven o clock was in portland place where her friend upstairs and described to her on her arrival as herself engaged in dressing instantly received her she knew on the spot poor fanny as she was afterwards to declare to the colonel that her feared crisis had popped up as at the touch of a spring that her impossible hour was before her her impossible hour was the hour of its coming out that she had known of old so much more than she had ever said and she had often put it to herself in apprehension she tried to think even in preparation that she should recognise the approach of her doom by a consciousness akin to that of the blowing open of a window on some night of the highest wind and the lowest thermometer it would be all in vain to have crouched so long by the fire the glass would have been smashed the icy air would fill the place if the air in maggie s room then on her going up was not as yet quite the polar blast she had expected it was distinctly none the less such an atmosphere as they had not hitherto breathed together the princess she perceived was completely dressed that business was over it added indeed to the effect of her importantly awaiting the assistance she had summoned of her showing a deck cleared so to speak for action her maid had already left her and she presented herself in the large clear room where everything was admirable but where nothing was out of place as for the first time in her life rather bedizened was it that she had put on too many things overcharged herself with jewels wore in particular more of them than usual and bigger ones in her hair a question her visitor presently answered by attributing this appearance largely to the bright red spot red as some monstrous ruby that burned in either of her cheeks these two items of her aspect had promptly enough their own light for mrs assingham who made out by it that nothing more pathetic could be imagined than the refuge and disguise her agitation had instinctively asked of the arts of dress multiplied to extravagance almost to incoherence she had had visibly her idea that of not betraying herself by inattentions into which she had never yet fallen and she stood there circled about and furnished forth as always in a manner that testified to her perfect little personal processes it had ever been her sign that she was for all occasions found ready without loose ends or exposed accessories or unremoved superfluities a suggestion of the swept and garnished in her whole splendid yet thereby more or less encumbered and embroidered setting that reflected her small still passion for order and symmetry for objects with their backs to the walls and spoke even of some probable reference in her american blood to dusting and polishing new england grandmothers if her apartment was princely in the clearness of the lingering day she looked as if she had been carried there prepared all attired and decorated like some holy image in a procession and left precisely to show what wonder she could work under pressure her friend felt how could she not as the truly pious priest might feel when confronted behind the altar before the festa with his miraculous madonna such an occasion would be grave in general with all the gravity of what he might look for but the gravity to night would be of the rarest what he might look for would depend so on what he could give xxxiii something very strange has happened and i think you ought to know it maggie spoke this indeed without extravagance yet with the effect of making her guest measure anew the force of her appeal it was their definite understanding whatever fanny knew fanny s faith would provide for and she knew accordingly at the end of five minutes what the extraordinary in the late occurrence had consisted of and how it had all come of maggie s achieved hour under mr crichton s protection at the museum he had desired mr crichton with characteristic kindness after the wonderful show after offered luncheon at his incorporated lodge hard by to see her safely home especially on his noting in attending her to the great steps that she had dismissed her carriage which she had done really just for the harmless amusement of taking her way alone she had known she should find herself as the consequence of such an hour in a sort of exalted state under the influence of which a walk through the london streets would be exactly what would suit her best an independent ramble impressed excited contented with nothing to mind and nobody to talk to and shop windows in plenty to look at if she liked a low taste of the essence it was to be supposed of her nature that she had of late for so many reasons been unable to gratify she had taken her leave with her thanks she knew her way quite enough it being also sufficiently the case that she had even a shy hope of not going too straight to wander a little wild was what would truly amuse her so that keeping clear of oxford street and cultivating an impression as of parts she didn t know she had ended with what she had more or less had been fancying an encounter with three or four shops an old bookseller s an old printmonger s a couple of places with dim antiquities in the window that were not as so many of the other shops those in sloane street say a hollow parade which had long since ceased to beguile there had remained with her moreover an allusion of charlotte s of some months before seed dropped into her imagination in the form of a casual speech about there being in bloomsbury such funny little fascinating places and even sometimes such unexpected finds there could perhaps have been no stronger mark than this sense of well nigh romantic opportunity no livelier sign of the impression made on her and always so long retained so watchfully nursed by any observation of charlotte s however lightly thrown off and then she had felt somehow more at her ease than for months and months before she didn t know why but her time at the museum oddly had done it it was as if she hadn t come into so many noble and beautiful associations nor secured them also for her boy secured them even for her father only to see them turn to vanity and doubt turn possibly to something still worse i believed in him again as much as ever and i felt how i believed in him she said with bright fixed eyes i felt it in the streets as i walked along and it was as if that helped me and lifted me up my being off by myself there not having for the moment to wonder and watch having on the contrary almost nothing on my mind it was so much as if everything would come out right that she had fallen to thinking of her father s birthday had given herself this as a reason for trying what she could pick up for it they would keep it at fawns where they had kept it before since it would be the twenty first of the month and she mightn t have another chance of making sure of something to offer him there was always the impossibility of course of finding him anything the least bit good that he wouldn t already long ago in his rummagings have seen himself and only not to think a quarter good enough this however was an old story and one could not have had any fun with him but for his sweet theory that the individual gift the friendship s offering was by a rigorous law of nature a foredoomed aberration and that the more it was so the more it showed and the more one cherished it for showing how friendly it had been the infirmity of art was the candour of affection the grossness of pedigree the refinement of sympathy the ugliest objects in fact as a general thing were the bravest the tenderest mementos and as such figured in glass cases apart worthy doubtless of the home but not worthy of the temple dedicated to the grimacing not to the clear faced gods she herself naturally through the past years had come to be much represented in those receptacles against the thick locked panes of which she still liked to flatten her nose finding in its place each time everything she had on successive anniversaries tried to believe he might pretend at her suggestion to be put off with or at least think curious she was now ready to try it again they had always with his pleasure in her pretence and her pleasure in his with the funny betrayal of the sacrifice to domestic manners on either side played the game so happily to this end on her way home she had loitered everywhere quite too deludedly among the old books and the old prints which had yielded nothing to her purpose but with a strange inconsequence in one of the other shops that of a small antiquarian a queer little foreign man who had shown her a number of things shown her finally something that struck with it as rather a rarity and thinking it would compared to some of her ventures quite superlatively do she had bought bought really when it came to that for a price it appears now it won t do at all said maggie something has happened since that puts it quite out of the question i had only my day of satisfaction in it but i feel at the same time as i keep it here before me that i wouldn t have missed it for the world she had talked from the first of her friend s entrances coherently enough even with a small quaver that overstated her calm but she held her breath every few seconds as if for deliberation and to prove she didn t pant all of which marked for fanny the depth of her commotion her reference to her thought about her father about her chance to pick up something that might divert him her mention in fine of his fortitude under presents having meanwhile naturally it should be said much less an amplitude of insistence on the speaker s lips than a power to produce on the part of the listener herself the prompt response and full comprehension of memory and sympathy of old amused observation the picture was filled out by the latter s fond fancy but maggie was at any rate under arms she knew what she was doing and had already her plan a plan for making for allowing as yet no difference in accordance with which she would still dine out and not with red eyes nor convulsed features nor neglected items of appearance nor anything that would raise a question yet there was some knowledge that exactly to this support of her not breaking down she desired she required possession of and with the sinister rise and fall of lightning unaccompanied by thunder it played before mrs assingham s eyes that she herself should have at whatever risk or whatever cost to supply her with the stuff of her need all our friend s instinct was to hold off from this till she should see what the ground would bear she would take no step nearer unless intelligibly to meet her and awkward though it might be to hover there only pale and distorted with mere imbecilities of vagueness there was a quality of bald help in the fact of not as yet guessing what such an ominous start could lead to she caught however after a second s thought at the princess s allusion to her lost reassurance you mean you were so at your ease on monday the night you dined with us i was very happy then said maggie yes we thought you so gay and so brilliant fanny felt it feeble but she went on we were so glad you were happy maggie stood a moment at first only looking at her you thought me all right eh surely dearest we thought you all right well i daresay it was natural but in point of fact i never was more wrong in my life for all the while if you please this was brewing mrs assingham indulged as nearly as possible to luxury her vagueness this that replied the princess whose eyes her companion now saw had turned to an object on the chimney piece of the room of which among so many precious objects the ververs wherever they might be always revelled peculiarly in matchless old mantel ornaments her visitor had not taken heed do you mean the gilt cup i mean the gilt cup the piece now recognised by fanny as new to her own vision was a capacious bowl of old looking rather strikingly yellow gold mounted by a short stem on an ample foot which held a central position above the fire place where to allow it the better to show a clearance had been made of other objects notably of the louis seize clock that accompanied the candelabra this latter trophy ticked at present on the marble slab of a commode that exactly matched it in splendour and style mrs assingham took it the bowl as a fine thing but the question was obviously not of its intrinsic value and she kept off from it admiring it at a distance but what has that to do it has everything you ll see with which again however for the moment maggie attached to her strange wide eyes he knew her before before i had ever seen him he knew but fanny while she cast about her for the links she missed could only echo it amerigo knew charlotte more than i ever dreamed fanny felt then it was stare for stare but surely you always knew they had met i didn t understand i knew too little don t you see what i mean the princess asked mrs assingham wondered during these instants how much she even now knew it had taken a minute to perceive how gently she was speaking with that perception of its being no challenge of wrath no heat of the deceived soul but only a free exposure of the completeness of past ignorance inviting derision even if it must the elder woman felt first a strange barely credible relief she drew in as if it had been the warm summer scent of a flower the sweet certainty of not meeting any way she should turn any consequence of judgment she shouldn t be judged save by herself which was her own wretched business the next moment however at all events she blushed within for her immediate cowardice she had thought of herself thought of getting off before so much as thinking that is of pitifully seeing that she was in presence of an appeal that was all an appeal that utterly accepted its necessity in a general way dear child yes but not a in connexion with what you ve been telling me they were intimate you see intimate said the princess fanny continued to face her taking from her excited eyes this history so dim and faint for all her anxious emphasis of the far away other time there s always the question of what one considers what one considers intimate well i know what i consider intimate now too intimate said maggie to let me know anything about it it was quiet yes but not too quiet for fanny assingham s capacity to wince only compatible with letting me you mean she had asked it after a pause but turning again to the new ornament of the chimney and wondering even while she took relief from it at this gap in her experience but here are things my dear of which my ignorance is perfect they went about together they re known to have done it and i don t mean only before i mean after after said fanny assingham before we were married yes but after we were engaged ah i ve known nothing about that and she said it with a braver assurance clutching with comfort at something that was apparently new to her that bowl maggie went on is so strangely too strangely almost to believe at this time of day the proof they were together all the while up to the very eve of our marriage don t you remember how just before that she came back so unexpectedly from america the question had for mrs assingham and whether all consciously or not the oddest pathos of simplicity oh yes dear of course i remember how she came back from america and how she stayed with us and what view one had of it maggie s eyes still all the time pressed and penetrated so that during a moment just here she might have given the little flare have made the little pounce of asking what then one s view had been to the small flash of this eruption fanny stood for her minute wittingly exposed but she saw it as quickly cease to threaten quite saw the princess even though in all her pain refuse in the interest of their strange and exalted bargain to take advantage of the opportunity for planting the stab of reproach the opportunity thus coming all of itself she saw her or she believed she saw her look at her chance for straight denunciation look at it and then pass it by and she felt herself with this fact hushed well nigh to awe at the lucid higher intention that no distress could confound and that no discovery since it was however obscurely a case of discovery could make less needful these seconds were brief they rapidly passed but they lasted long enough to renew our friend s sense of her own extraordinary undertaking the function again imposed on her the answerability again drilled into her by this intensity of intimation she was reminded of the terms on which she was let off her quantity of release having made its sufficient show in that recall of her relation to charlotte s old reappearance and deep within the whole impression glowed ah so inspiringly when it came to that her steady view clear from the first of the beauty of her companion s motive it was like a fresh sacrifice for a larger conquest only see me through now do it in the face of this and in spite of it and i leave you a hand of which the freedom isn t to be said the aggravation of fear or call it apparently of knowledge had jumped straight into its place as an aggravation above all for her father the effect of this being but to quicken to passion her reasons for making his protectedness or in other words the forms of his ignorance still the law of her attitude and the key to her solution she kept as tight hold of these reasons and these forms in her confirmed horror as the rider of a plunging horse grasps his seat with his knees and she might absolutely have been putting it to her guest that she believed she could stay on if they should only meet nothing more though ignorant still of what she had definitely met fanny yearned within over her spirit and so no word about it said passed through mere pitying eyes a vow to walk ahead and at crossroads with a lantern for the darkness and wavings away for unadvised traffic look out for alarms there was accordingly no wait in maggie s reply they spent together hours spent at least a morning the certainty of which has come back to me now but that i didn t dream of it at the time that cup there has turned witness by the most wonderful of chances that s why since it has been here i ve stood it out for my husband to see put it where it would meet him almost immediately if he should come into the room i ve wanted it to meet him she went on and i ve wanted him to meet it and to be myself present at the meeting but that hasn t taken place as yet often as he has lately been in the way of coming to see me here yes in particular lately he hasn t showed to day it was with her managed quietness more and more that she talked an achieved coherence that helped her evidently to hear and to watch herself there was support and thereby an awful harmony but which meant a further guidance in the facts she could add together it s quite as if he had an instinct something that has warned him off or made him uneasy he doesn t quite know naturally what has happened but guesses with his beautiful cleverness that something has and isn t in a hurry to be confronted with it so in his vague fear he keeps off but being meanwhile in the house i ve no idea not having seen him to day by exception since before luncheon he spoke to me then the princess freely explained of a ballot of great importance at a club for somebody some personal friend i think who s coming up and is supposed to be in danger to make an effort for him he thought he had better lunch there you see the efforts he can make for which maggie found a smile that went to her friend s heart he s in so many ways the kindest of men but it was hours ago mrs assingham thought the more danger then of his coming in and finding me here i don t know you see what you now consider that you ve ascertained nor anything of the connexion with it of that object that you declare so damning her eyes rested on this odd acquisition and then quitted it went back to it and again turned from it it was inscrutable in its rather stupid elegance and yet from the moment one had thus appraised it vivid and definite in its domination of the scene fanny could no more overlook it now than she could have overlooked a lighted christmas tree but nervously and all in vain she dipped into her mind for some floating reminiscence of it at the same time that this attempt left her blank she understood a good deal she even not a little shared the prince s mystic apprehension the golden bowl put on under consideration a sturdy a conscious perversity as a document somehow it was ugly though it might have a decorative grace his finding me here in presence of it might be more flagrantly disagreeable for all of us than you intend or than would necessarily help us and i must take time truly to understand what it means you re safe as far as that goes maggie returned you may take it from me that he won t come in and that i shall only find him below waiting for me when i go down to the carriage fanny assingham took it from her took it and more we re to sit together at the ambassador s then or at least you two are with this new complication thrust up before you all unexplained and to look at each other with faces that pretend for the ghastly hour not to be seeing it maggie looked at her with a face that might have been the one she was preparing unexplained my dear quite the contrary explained fully intensely admirably explained with nothing really to add my own love she kept it up i don t want anything more i ve plenty to go upon and to do with as it is fanny assingham stood there in her comparative darkness with her links verily still missing but the most acceptable effect of this was singularly as yet a cold fear of getting nearer the fact but when you come home i mean he ll come up with you again won t he see it then on which maggie gave her after an instant s visible thought the strangest of slow headshakes i don t know perhaps he ll never see it if it only stands there waiting for him he may never again said the princess come into this room fanny more deeply wondered never again oh yes it may be how do i know with this she quietly went on she had not looked again at the incriminating piece but there was a marvel to her friend in the way the little word representing it seemed to express and include for her the whole of her situation then you intend not to speak to him maggie waited to speak well about your having it and about what you consider that it represents oh i don t know that i shall speak if he doesn t but his keeping away from me because of that what will that be but to speak he can t say or do more it won t be for me to speak maggie added in a different tone one of the tones that had already so penetrated her guest it will be for me to listen mrs assingham turned it over then it all depends on that object that you regard for your reasons as evidence i think i may say that i depend on it i can t said maggie treat it as nothing now mrs assingham at this went closer to the cup on the chimney quite liking to feel that she did so moreover without going closer to her companion s vision she looked at the precious thing if precious it was found herself in fact eyeing it as if by her dim solicitation to draw its secret from it rather than suffer the imposition of maggie s knowledge it was brave and rich and firm with its bold deep hollow and without this queer torment about it would thanks to her love of plenty of yellow figure to her as an enviable ornament a possession really desirable she didn t touch it but if after a minute she turned away from it the reason was rather oddly and suddenly in her fear of doing so then it all depends on the bowl i mean your future does for that s what it comes to i judge what it comes to maggie presently returned is what that thing has put me so almost miraculously in the way of learning how far they had originally gone together if there was so much between them before there can t with all the other appearances not be a great deal more now and she went on and on she steadily made her points if such things were already then between them they make all the difference for possible doubt of what may have been between them since if there had been nothing before there might be explanations but it makes to day too much to explain i mean to explain away she said fanny assingham was there to explain away of this she was duly conscious for that at least had been true up to now in the light however of maggie s demonstration the quantity even without her taking as yet a more exact measure might well seem larger than ever besides which with or without exactness the effect of each successive minute in the place was to put her more in presence of what maggie herself saw maggie herself saw the truth and that was really while they remained there together enough for mrs assingham s relation to it there was a force in the princess s mere manner about it that made the detail of what she knew a matter of minor importance fanny had in fact something like a momentary shame over her own need of asking for this detail i don t pretend to repudiate she said after a little my own impressions of the different times i suppose you speak of any more she added than i can forget what difficulties and as it constantly seemed to me what dangers every course of action whatever i should decide upon made for me i tried i tried hard to act for the best and you know she next pursued while at the sound of her own statement a slow courage and even a faint warmth of conviction came back to her and you know i believe it s what i shall turn out to have done this produced a minute during which their interchange though quickened and deepened was that of silence only and the long charged look all of which found virtual consecration when maggie at last spoke i m sure you tried to act for the best it kept fanny assingham again a minute in silence i never thought dearest you weren t an angel not however that this alone was much help it was up to the very eve you see the princess went on up to within two or three days of our marriage that that you know and she broke down for strangely smiling yes as i say it was while she was with me but i didn t know it that is said fanny assingham i didn t know of anything in particular it sounded weak that she felt but she had really her point to make what i mean is that i don t know for knowledge now anything i didn t then that s how i am she still however floundered i mean it s how i was but don t they how you were and how you are maggie asked come practically to the same thing the elder woman s words had struck her own ear as in the tone now mistimed of their recent but all too factitious understanding arrived at in hours when as there was nothing susceptible of proof there was nothing definitely to disprove the situation had changed by well by whatever there was by the outbreak of the definite and this could keep maggie at least firm she was firm enough as she pursued it was on the whole thing that amerigo married me with which her eyes had their turn again at her damnatory piece and it was on that it was on that but they came back to her visitor and it was on it all that father married her her visitor took it as might be they both married ah that you must believe with the highest intentions father did certainly and then at the renewal of this consciousness it all rolled over her ah to thrust such things on us to do them here between us and with us day after day and in return in return to do it to him to him to him fanny hesitated you mean it s for him you most suffer and then as the princess after a look but turned away moving about the room which made the question somehow seem a blunder i ask she continued because i think everything everything we now speak of may be for him really may be made for him quite as if it hadn t been but maggie had the next moment faced about as if without hearing her father did it for me did it all and only for me mrs assingham with a certain promptness threw up her head but she faltered again before she spoke well it was only an intended word but maggie showed after an instant that it had reached her do you mean that that s the reason that that s a reason fanny at first however feeling the response in this didn t say all she meant she said for the moment something else instead he did it for you largely at least for you and it was for you that i did in my smaller interested way well what i could do for i could do something she continued i thought i saw your interest as he himself saw it and i thought i saw charlotte s i believed in her and i believed in her said maggie mrs assingham waited again but she presently pushed on she believed then in herself ah maggie murmured something exquisite faintly eager in the prompt simplicity of it supported her friend further and the prince believed his belief was real just as he believed in himself maggie spent a minute in taking it from her he believed in himself just as i too believed in him for i absolutely did maggie to which fanny then added and i believe in him yet i mean she subjoined well i mean i do maggie again took it from her after which she was again restlessly set afloat then when this had come to an end and do you believe in charlotte yet mrs assingham had a demur that she felt she could now afford we ll talk of charlotte some other day they both at any rate thought themselves safe at the time then why did they keep from me everything i might have known her friend bent upon her the mildest eyes why did i myself keep it from you oh you weren t for honour obliged dearest maggie the poor woman broke out on this you are divine they pretended to love me the princess went on and they pretended to love him and pray what was there that i didn t pretend not at any rate to care for me as you cared for amerigo and for charlotte they were much more interesting it was perfectly natural how couldn t you like amerigo maggie continued mrs assingham gave it up how couldn t i how couldn t i then with a fine freedom she went all her way how can t i how can t i it fixed afresh maggie s wide eyes on her i see i see well it s beautiful for you to be able to and of course she added you wanted to help charlotte yes fanny considered it i wanted to help charlotte but i wanted also you see to help you by not digging up a past that i believed with so much on top of it solidly buried i wanted as i still want she richly declared to help every one it set maggie once more in movement movement which however spent itself again with a quick emphasis then it s a good deal my fault if everything really began so well fanny assingham met it as she could you ve been only too perfect you ve thought only too much but the princess had already caught at the words yes i ve thought only too much yet she appeared to continue for the minute full of that fault she had it in fact by this prompted thought all before her of him dear man of him her friend able to take in thus directly her vision of her father watched her with a new suspense that way might safety lie it was like a wider chink of light he believed with a beauty in charlotte yes and it was i who had made him believe i didn t mean to at the time so much for i had no idea then of what was coming but i did it i did it the princess declared with a beauty ah with a beauty you too mrs assingham insisted maggie however was seeing for herself it was another matter the thing was that he made her think it would be so possible fanny again hesitated the prince made her think maggie stared she had meant her father but her vision seemed to spread they both made her think she wouldn t have thought without them yet amerigo s good faith mrs assingham insisted was perfect and there was nothing all the more she added against your father s the remark however kept maggie for a moment still nothing perhaps but his knowing that she knew knew that he was doing it so much for me to what extent she suddenly asked of her friend do you think he was aware that she knew ah who can say what passes between people in such a relation the only thing one can be sure of is that he was generous and mrs assingham conclusively smiled he doubtless knew as much as was right for himself as much that is as was right for her yes then as was right for her the point is fanny declared that whatever his knowledge it made all the way it went for his good faith maggie continued to gaze and her friend now fairly waited on her successive movements isn t the point very considerably that his good faith must have been his faith in her taking almost as much interest in me as he himself took fanny assingham thought he recognised he adopted your long friendship but he founded on it no selfishness no said maggie with still deeper consideration he counted her selfishness out almost as he counted his own so you may say very well maggie went on if he had none of his own he invited her may have expected her on her side to have as little and she may only since have found that out mrs assingham looked blank since and he may have become aware maggie pursued that she has found it out that she has taken the measure since their marriage she explained of how much he had asked of her more say than she had understood at the time he may have made out at last how such a demand was in the long run to affect her he may have done many things mrs assingham responded but there s one thing he certainly won t have done he ll never have shown that he expected of her a quarter as much as she must have understood he was to give i ve often wondered maggie mused what charlotte really understood but it s one of the things she has never told me then as it s one of the things she has never told me either we shall probably never know it and we may regard it as none of our business there are many things said mrs assingham that we shall never know maggie took it in with a long reflection never but there are others her friend went on that stare us in the face and that under whatever difficulty you may feel you labour may now be enough for us your father has been extraordinary it had been as if maggie were feeling her way but she rallied to this with a rush extraordinary magnificent said fanny assingham her companion held tight to it magnificent then he ll do for himself whatever there may be to do what he undertook for you he ll do to the end he didn t undertake it to break down in what quiet patient exquisite as he is did he ever break down he had never in his life proposed to himself to have failed and he won t have done it on this occasion ah this occasion and maggie s wail showed her of a sudden thrown back on it am i in the least sure that with everything he even knows what it is and yet am i in the least sure he doesn t if he doesn t then so much the better leave him alone do you mean give him up leave her fanny assingham went on leave her to him maggie looked at her darkly do you mean leave him to her after this after everything aren t they for that matter intimately together now intimately how do i know but fanny kept it up aren t you and your husband in spite of everything maggie s eyes still further if possible dilated it remains to be seen if you re not then where s your faith in my husband mrs assingham but for an instant hesitated in your father it all comes back to that rest on it on his ignorance fanny met it again on whatever he may offer you take that take it maggie stared mrs assingham held up her head and be grateful on which for a minute she let the princess face her do you see i see said maggie at last then there you are but maggie had turned away moving to the window as if still to keep something in her face from sight she stood there with her eyes on the street while mrs assingham s reverted to that complicating object on the chimney as to which her condition so oddly even to herself was that both of recurrent wonder and recurrent protest she went over it looked at it afresh and yielded now to her impulse to feel it in her hands she laid them on it lifting it up and was surprised thus with the weight of it she had seldom handled so much massive gold that effect itself somehow prompted her to further freedom and presently to saying i don t believe in this you know it brought maggie round to her don t believe in it you will when i tell you ah tell me nothing i won t have it said mrs assingham she kept the cup in her hand held it there in a manner that gave maggie s attention to her she saw the next moment a quality of excited suspense this suggested to her oddly that she had with the liberty she was taking an air of intention and the impression betrayed by her companion s eyes grew more distinct in a word of warning it s of value but its value s impaired i ve learned by a crack a crack in the gold it isn t gold with which somewhat strangely maggie smiled that s the point what is it then it s glass and cracked under the gilt as i say at that glass of this weight well said maggie it s crystal and was once i suppose precious but what she then asked do you mean to do with it she had come away from her window one of the three by which the wide room enjoying an advantageous back commanded the western sky and caught a glimpse of the evening flush while mrs assingham possessed of the bowl and possessed too of this indication of a flaw approached another for the benefit of the slowly fading light here thumbing the singular piece weighing it turning it over and growing suddenly more conscious above all of an irresistible impulse she presently spoke again a crack then your whole idea has a crack maggie by this time at some distance from her waited a moment if you mean by my idea the knowledge that has come to me that but fanny with decision had already taken her up there s only one knowledge that concerns us one fact with which we can have anything to do which one then the fact that your husband has never never never but the very gravity of this statement while she raised her eyes to her friend across the room made her for an instant hang fire well never what never been half so interested in you as now but don t you my dear really feel it maggie considered oh i think what i ve told you helps me to feel it his having to day given up even his forms his keeping away from me his not having come and she shook her head as against all easy glosses it is because of that you know well then if it s because of this and fanny assingham who had been casting about her and whose inspiration decidedly had come raised the cup in her two hands raised it positively above her head and from under it solemnly smiled at the princess as a signal of intention so for an instant full of her thought and of her act she held the precious vessel and then with due note taken of the margin of the polished floor bare fine and hard in the embrasure of her window she dashed it boldly to the ground where she had the thrill of seeing it with the violence of the crash lie shattered she had flushed with the force of her effort as maggie had flushed with wonder at the sight and this high reflection in their faces was all that passed between them for a minute more after which whatever you meant by it and i don t want to know now has ceased to exist mrs assingham said and what in the world my dear did you mean by it that sound as at the touch of a spring rang out as the first effect of fanny s speech it broke upon the two women s absorption with a sharpness almost equal to the smash of the crystal for the door of the room had been opened by the prince without their taking heed he had apparently had time moreover to catch the conclusion of fanny s act his eyes attached themselves through the large space allowing just there as happened a free view to the shining fragments at this lady s feet his question had been addressed to his wife but he moved his eyes immediately afterwards to those of her visitor whose own then held them in a manner of which neither party had been capable doubtless for mute penetration since the hour spent by him in cadogan place on the eve of his marriage and the afternoon of charlotte s reappearance something now again became possible for these communicants under the intensity of their pressure something that took up that tale and that might have been a redemption of pledges then exchanged this rapid play of suppressed appeal and disguised response lasted indeed long enough for more results than one long enough for mrs assingham to measure the feat of quick self recovery possibly therefore of recognition still more immediate accompanying amerigo s vision and estimate of the evidence with which she had been so admirably she felt as she looked at him inspired to deal she looked at him and looked at him there were so many things she wanted on the spot to say but maggie was looking too and was moreover looking at them both so that these things for the elder woman quickly enough reduced themselves to one she met his question not too late since in their silence it had remained in the air gathering herself to go leaving the golden bowl split into three pieces on the ground she simply referred him to his wife she should see them later they would all meet soon again and meanwhile as to what maggie had meant she said in her turn from the door why maggie herself was doubtless by this time ready to tell him xxxiv left with her husband maggie however for the time said nothing she only felt on the spot a strong sharp wish not to see his face again till he should have had a minute to arrange it she had seen it enough for her temporary clearness and her next movement seen it as it showed during the stare of surprise that followed his entrance then it was that she knew how hugely expert she had been made for judging it quickly by that vision of it indelibly registered for reference that had flashed a light into her troubled soul the night of his late return from matcham the expression worn by it at that juncture for however few instants had given her a sense of its possibilities one of the most relevant of which might have been playing up for her before the consummation of fanny assingham s retreat just long enough to be recognised what she had recognised in it was his recognition the result of his having been forced by the flush of their visitor s attitude and the unextinguished report of her words to take account of the flagrant signs of the accident of the incident on which he had unexpectedly dropped he had not unnaturally failed to see this occurrence represented by the three fragments of an object apparently valuable which lay there on the floor and which even across the width of the room his kept interval reminded him unmistakably though confusedly of something known some other unforgotten image that was a mere shock that was a pain as if fanny s violence had been a violence redoubled and acting beyond its intention a violence calling up the hot blood as a blow across the mouth might have called it maggie knew as she turned away from him that she didn t want his pain what she wanted was her own simple certainty not the red mark of conviction flaming there in his beauty if she could have gone on with bandaged eyes she would have liked that best if it were a question of saying what she now apparently should have to and of taking from him what he would say any blindness that might wrap it would be the nearest approach to a boon she went in silence to where her friend never in intention visibly so much her friend as at that moment had braced herself to so amazing an energy and there under amerigo s eyes she picked up the shining pieces bedizened and jewelled in her rustling finery she paid with humility of attitude this prompt tribute to order only to find however that she could carry but two of the fragments at once she brought them over to the chimney piece to the conspicuous place occupied by the cup before fanny s appropriation of it and after laying them carefully down went back for what remained the solid detached foot with this she returned to the mantel shelf placing it with deliberation in the centre and then for a minute occupying herself as with the attempt to fit the other morsels after she had squared again her little objects on the chimney she was within an ace in fact of turning on him with that appeal besides its being lucid for her all the while that the occasion was passing that they were dining out that he wasn t dressed and that though she herself was she was yet in all probability so horribly red in the face and so awry in many ways with agitation that in view of the ambassador s company of possible comments and constructions she should need before her glass some restoration of appearances amerigo meanwhile after all could clearly make the most of her having enjoined on him to wait suggested it by the positive pomp of her dealings with the smashed cup to wait that is till she should pronounce as mrs assingham had promised for her this delay again certainly tested her presence of mind though that strain was not what presently made her speak keep her eyes for the time from her husband s as she might she soon found herself much more drivingly conscious of the strain on his own wit there was even a minute when her back was turned to him during which she knew once more the strangeness of her desire to spare him a strangeness that had already fifty times brushed her in the depth of her trouble as with the wild wing of some bird of the air who might blindly have swooped for an instant into the shaft of a well darkening there by his momentary flutter the far off round of sky it was extraordinary this quality in the taste of her wrong which made her completed sense of it seem rather to soften than to harden and it was the more extraordinary the more she had to recognise it for what it came to was that seeing herself finally sure knowing everything having the fact in all its abomination so utterly before her that there was nothing else to add what it came to was that merely by being with him there in silence she felt within her the sudden split between conviction and action they had begun to cease on the spot surprisingly to be connected conviction that is budged no inch only planting its feet the more firmly in the soil but action began to hover like some lighter and larger but easier form excited by its very power to keep above ground it would be free it would be independent it would go in wouldn t it for some prodigious and superior adventure of its own what would condemn it so to speak to the responsibility of freedom this glimmered on maggie even now was the possibility richer with every lapsing moment that her husband would have on the whole question a new need of her a need which was in fact being born between them in these very seconds it struck her truly as so new that he would have felt hitherto none to compare with it at all would indeed absolutely by this circumstance be really needing her for the first one in their whole connection no he had used her had even exceedingly enjoyed her before this but there had been no precedent for that character of a proved necessity to him which she was rapidly taking on the immense advantage of this particular clue moreover was that she should have now to arrange alter to falsify nothing should have to be but consistently simple and straight she asked herself with concentration while her back was still presented what would be the very ideal of that method after which the next instant it had all come to her and she had turned round upon him for the application fanny assingham broke it knowing it had a crack and that it would go if she used sufficient force she thought when i had told her that that would be the best thing to do with it thought so from her own point of view that hadn t been at all my idea but she acted before i understood i had on the contrary she explained put it here in full view exactly that you might see he stood with his hands in his pockets he had carried his eyes to the fragments on the chimney piece and she could already distinguish the element of relief absolutely of succour in his acceptance from her of the opportunity to consider the fruits of their friend s violence every added inch of reflection and delay having the advantage from this point on of counting for him double it had operated within her now to the last intensity her glimpse of the precious truth that by her helping him helping him to help himself as it were she should help him to help her hadn t she fairly got into his labyrinth with him wasn t she indeed in the very act of placing herself there for him at its centre and core whence on that definite orientation and by an instinct all her own she might securely guide him out of it she offered him thus assuredly a kind of support that was not to have been imagined in advance and that moreover required ah most truly some close looking at before it could be believed in and pronounced void of treachery yes look look she seemed to see him hear her say even while her sounded words were other look look both at the truth that still survives in that smashed evidence and at the even more remarkable appearance that i m not such a fool as you supposed me look at the possibility that since i am different there may still be something in it for you if you re capable of working with me to get that out consider of course as you must the question of what you may have to surrender on your side what price you may have to pay whom you may have to pay with to set this advantage free but take in at any rate that there is something for you if you don t too blindly spoil your chance for it he went no nearer the damnatory pieces but he eyed them from where he stood with a degree of recognition just visibly less to be dissimulated all of which represented for her a certain traceable process and her uttered words meanwhile were different enough from those he might have inserted between the lines of her already spoken it s the golden bowl you know that you saw at the little antiquario s in bloomsbury so long ago when you went there with charlotte when you spent those hours with her unknown to me a day or two before our marriage it was shown you both but you didn t take it you left it for me and i came upon it extraordinarily through happening to go into the same shop on monday last in walking home in prowling about to pick up some small old thing for father s birthday after my visit to the museum my appointment there with mr crichton of which i told you it was shown me and i was struck with it and took it knowing nothing about it at the time what i now know i ve learned since i learned this afternoon a couple of hours ago receiving from it naturally a great impression so there it is in its three pieces you can handle them don t be afraid if you want to make sure the thing is the thing you and charlotte saw together its having come apart makes an unfortunate difference for its beauty its artistic value but none for anything else its other value is just the same i mean that of its having given me so much of the truth about you i don t therefore so much care what becomes of it now unless perhaps you may yourself when you come to think have some good use for it in that case maggie wound up we can easily take the pieces with us to fawns it was wonderful how she felt by the time she had seen herself through this narrow pass that she had really achieved something that she was emerging a little in fine with the prospect less contracted she had done for him that is what her instinct enjoined had laid a basis not merely momentary on which he could meet her when by the turn of his head he did finally meet her this was the last thing that glimmered out of his look but it came into sight none the less as a perception of his distress and almost as a question of his eyes so that for still another minute before he committed himself there occurred between them a kind of unprecedented moral exchange over which her superior lucidity presided it was not however that when he did commit himself the show was promptly portentous but what in the world has fanny assingham had to do with it she could verily out of all her smothered soreness almost have smiled his question so affected her as giving the whole thing up to her but it left her only to go the straighter she has had to do with it that i immediately sent for her and that she immediately came she was the first person i wanted to see because i knew she would know know more about what i had learned i mean than i could make out for myself i made out as much as i could for myself that i also wanted to have done but it didn t in spite of everything take me very far and she has really been a help not so much as she would like to be not so much as poor dear she just now tried to be yet she has done her very best for you never forget that and has kept me along immeasurably better than i should have been able to come without her she has gained me time and that these three months don t you see has been everything she had said don t you see on purpose and was to feel the next moment that it had acted these three months the prince asked counting from the night you came home so late from matcham counting from the hours you spent with charlotte at gloucester your visit to the cathedral which you won t have forgotten describing to me in so much detail for that was the beginning of my being sure before it i had been sufficiently in doubt sure maggie developed of your having and of your having for a long time had two relations with charlotte he stared a little at sea as he took it up two something in the tone of it gave it a sense or an ambiguity almost foolish leaving maggie to feel as in a flash how such a consequence a foredoomed infelicity partaking of the ridiculous even in one of the cleverest might be of the very essence of the penalty of wrong doing oh you may have had fifty had the same relation with her fifty times it s of the number of kinds of relation with her that i speak a number that doesn t matter really so long as there wasn t only one kind as father and i supposed one kind she went on was there before us we took that fully for granted as you saw and accepted it we never thought of there being another kept out of our sight but after the evening i speak of i knew there was something else as i say i had before that my idea which you never dreamed i had from the moment i speak of it had more to go upon and you became yourselves you and she vaguely yet uneasily conscious of the difference but it s within these last hours that i ve most seen where we are and as i ve been in communication with fanny assingham about my doubts so i wanted to let her know my certainty with the determination of which however you must understand she has had nothing to do she defends you maggie remarked he had given her all his attention and with this impression for her again that he was in essence fairly reaching out to her for time time only time she could sufficiently imagine and to whatever strangeness that he absolutely liked her to talk even at the cost of his losing almost everything else by it it was still for a minute as if he waited for something worse wanted everything that was in her to come out any definite fact anything more precisely nameable so that he too as was his right should know where he was what stirred in him above all while he followed in her face the clear train of her speech must have been the impulse to take up something she put before him that he was yet afraid directly to touch he wanted to make free with it but had to keep his hands off for reasons he had already made out and the discomfort of his privation yearned at her out of his eyes with an announcing gleam of the fever the none too tolerable chill of specific recognition she affected him as speaking more or less for her father as well and his eyes might have been trying to hypnotise her into giving him the answer without his asking the question had he his idea and has he now with you anything more those were the words he had to hold himself from not speaking and that she would as yet certainly do nothing to make easy she felt with her sharpest thrill how he was straitened and tied and with the miserable pity of it her present conscious purpose of keeping him so could none the less perfectly accord to name her father on any such basis of anxiety of compunction would be to do the impossible thing to do neither more nor less than give charlotte away visibly palpably traceably he stood off from this moved back from it as from an open chasm now suddenly perceived but which had been between the two with so much so strangely much else quite uncalculated verily it towered before her this history of their confidence they had built strong and piled high based as it was on such appearances their conviction that thanks to her native complacencies of so many sorts she would always quite to the end and through and through take them as nobly sparing her amerigo was at any rate having the sensation of a particular ugliness to avoid a particular difficulty to count with that practically found him as unprepared as if he had been like his wife an abjectly simple person and she meanwhile however abjectly simple was further discerning for herself that whatever he might have to take from her she being on her side beautifully free he would absolutely not be able for any qualifying purpose to name charlotte either as his father in law s wife mrs verver rose between them there for the time in august and prohibitive form to protect her defend her explain about her was at the least to bring her into the question which would be by the same stroke to bring her husband but this was exactly the door maggie wouldn t open to him on all of which she was the next moment asking herself if thus warned and embarrassed he were not fairly writhing in his pain he writhed on that hypothesis some seconds more for it was not till then that he had chosen between what he could do and what he couldn t you re apparently drawing immense conclusions from very small matters won t you perhaps feel in fairness that you re striking out triumphing or whatever i may call it rather too easily feel it when i perfectly admit that your smashed cup there does come back to me i frankly confess now to the occasion and to having wished not to speak of it to you at the time we took two or three hours together by arrangement it was on the eve of my marriage at the moment you say but that put it on the eve of yours too my dear which was directly the point it was desired to find for you at the eleventh hour some small wedding present a hunt for something worth giving you and yet possible from other points of view as well in which it seemed i could be of use you were naturally not to be told precisely because it was all for you we went forth together and we looked we rummaged about and as i remember we called it we prowled then it was that as i freely recognise we came across that crystal cup which i m bound to say upon my honour i think it rather a pity fanny assingham from whatever good motive should have treated so he had kept his hands in his pockets he turned his eyes again but more complacently now to the ruins of the precious vessel and maggie could feel him exhale into the achieved quietness of his explanation a long deep breath of comparative relief behind everything beneath everything it was somehow a comfort to him at last to be talking with her and he seemed to be proving to himself that he could talk it was at a little shop in bloomsbury i think i could go to the place now the man understood italian i remember he wanted awfully to work off his bowl but i didn t believe in it and we didn t take it maggie had listened with an interest that wore all the expression of candour oh you left it for me but what did you take he looked at her first as if he were trying to remember then as if he might have been trying to forget nothing i think at that place what did you take then at any other what did you get me since that was your aim and end for a wedding gift the prince continued very nobly to bethink himself didn t we get you anything maggie waited a little she had for some time now kept her eyes on him steadily but they wandered at this to the fragments on her chimney yes it comes round after all to your having got me the bowl i myself was to come upon it the other day by so wonderful a chance was to find it in the same place and to have it pressed upon me by the same little man who does as you say understand italian i did believe in it you see must have believed in it somehow instinctively for i took it as soon as i saw it though i didn t know at all then she added what i was taking with it the prince paid her for an instant visibly the deference of trying to imagine what this might have been i agree with you that the coincidence is extraordinary the sort of thing that happens mainly in novels and plays but i don t see you must let me say the importance or the connexion of my having made the purchase where you failed of it she had quickly taken him up but she had with her eyes on him once more another drop into the order of her thoughts to which through whatever he might say she was still adhering it s not my having gone into the place at the end of four years that makes the strangeness of the coincidence for don t such chances as that in london easily occur the strangeness she lucidly said is in what my purchase was to represent to me after i had got it home which value came she explained from the wonder of my having found such a friend such a friend as a wonder assuredly her husband could but take it as the little man in the shop he did for me more than he knew i owe it to him he took an interest in me maggie said and taking that interest he recalled your visit he remembered you and spoke of you to me on which the prince passed the comment of a sceptical smile ah but my dear if extraordinary things come from people s taking an interest in you my life in that case she asked must be very agitated well he liked me i mean very particularly it s only so i can account for my afterwards hearing from him and in fact he gave me that to day she pursued he gave me it frankly as his reason to day the prince inquiringly echoed but she was singularly able it had been marvellously given her she afterwards said to herself to abide for her light for her clue by her own order i inspired him with sympathy there you are but the miracle is that he should have a sympathy to offer that could be of use to me that was really the oddity of my chance the princess proceeded that i should have been moved in my ignorance to go precisely to him he saw her so keep her course that it was as if he could at the best but stand aside to watch her and let her pass he only made a vague demonstration that was like an ineffective gesture i m sorry to say any ill of your friends and the thing was a long time ago besides which there was nothing to make me recur to it but i remember the man s striking me as a decided little beast she gave a slow headshake as if no after consideration not that way were an issue i can only think of him as kind for he had nothing to gain he had in fact only to lose it was what he came to tell me that he had asked me too high a price more than the object was really worth there was a particular reason which he hadn t mentioned and which had made him consider and repent he wrote for leave to see me again wrote in such terms that i saw him here this afternoon here it made the prince look about him downstairs in the little red room while he was waiting he looked at the few photographs that stand about there and recognised two of them though it was so long ago he remembered the visit made him by the lady and the gentleman and that gave him his connexion it gave me mine for he remembered everything and told me everything you see you too had produced your effect only unlike you he had thought of it again he had recurred to it he told me of your having wished to make each other presents but of that s not having come off the lady was greatly taken with the piece i had bought of him but you had your reason against receiving it from her and you had been right he would think that of you more than ever now maggie went on he would see how wisely you had guessed the flaw and how easily the bowl could be broken i had bought it myself you see for a present he knew i was doing that this was what had worked in him especially after the price i had paid her story had dropped an instant she still brought it out in small waves of energy each of which spent its force so that he had an opportunity to speak before this force was renewed but the quaint thing was what he now said and what pray was the price she paused again a little it was high certainly for those fragments i think i feel as i look at them there rather ashamed to say the prince then again looked at them he might have been growing used to the sight but shall you at least get your money back oh i m far from wanting it back i feel so that i m getting its worth with which before he could reply she had a quick transition the great fact about the day we re talking of seems to me to have been quite remarkably that no present was then made me if your undertaking had been for that that was not at least what came of it you received then nothing at all the prince looked vague and grave almost retrospectively concerned nothing but an apology for empty hands and empty pockets which was made me as if it mattered a mite ever so frankly ever so beautifully and touchingly this amerigo heard with interest yet not with confusion ah of course you couldn t have minded distinctly as she went on he was getting the better of the mere awkwardness of his arrest quite as if making out that he need suffer arrest from her now before they should go forth to show themselves in the world together in no greater quantity than an occasion ill chosen at the best for a scene might decently make room for he looked at his watch their engagement all the while remained before him but i don t make out you see what case against me you rest on everything i m telling you why the whole case the case of your having for so long so successfully deceived me the idea of your finding something for me charming as that would have been was what had least to do with your taking a morning together at that moment what had really to do with it said maggie was that you had to you couldn t not from the moment you were again face to face and the reason of that was that there had been so much between you before before i came between you at all her husband had been for these last moments moving about under her eyes but at this as to check any show of impatience he again stood still you ve never been more sacred to me than you were at that hour unless perhaps you ve become so at this one the assurance of his speech she could note quite held up its head in him his eyes met her own so for the declaration that it was as if something cold and momentarily unimaginable breathed upon her from afar off out of his strange consistency she kept her direction still however under that oh the thing i ve known best of all is that you ve never wanted together to offend us you ve wanted quite intensely not to and the precautions you ve had to take for it have been for a long time one of the strongest of my impressions that i think she added is the way i ve best known known he repeated after a moment known known that you were older friends and so much more intimate ones than i had any reason to suppose when we married known there were things that hadn t been told me and that gave their meaning little by little to other things that were before me would they have made a difference in the matter of our marriage the prince presently asked if you had known them she took her time to think i grant you not in the matter of ours and then as he again fixed her with his hard yearning which he couldn t keep down the question is so much bigger than that you see how much what i know makes of it for me that was what acted on him this iteration of her knowledge into the question of the validity of the various bearings of which he couldn t on the spot trust himself to pretend in any high way to go what her claim as she made it represented for him that he couldn t help betraying if only as a consequence of the effect of the word itself her repeated distinct know know on his nerves she was capable of being sorry for his nerves at a time when he should need them for dining out pompously rather responsibly without his heart in it yet she was not to let that prevent her using with all economy so precious a chance for supreme clearness i didn t force this upon you you must recollect and it probably wouldn t have happened for you if you hadn t come in ah said the prince i was liable to come in you know i didn t think you were this evening and why not well she answered you have many liabilities of different sorts with which she recalled what she had said to fanny assingham and then you re so deep it produced in his features in spite of his control of them one of those quick plays of expression the shade of a grimace that testified as nothing else did to his race it s you cara who are deep which after an instant she had accepted from him she could so feel at last that it was true then i shall have need of it all but what would you have done he was by this time asking if i hadn t come in i don t know she had hesitated what would you oh io that isn t the question i depend upon you i go on you would have spoken to morrow i think i would have waited and for what he asked to see what difference it would make for myself my possession at last i mean of real knowledge oh said the prince my only point now at any rate she went on is the difference as i say that it may make for you your knowing was from the moment you did come in all i had in view and she sounded it again he should have it once more your knowing that i ve ceased that you ve ceased with her pause in fact she had fairly made him press her for it why to be as i was not to know it was once more then after a little that he had had to stand receptive yet the singular effect of this was that there was still something of the same sort he was made to want he had another hesitation but at last this odd quantity showed then does any one else know it was as near as he could come to naming her father and she kept him at that distance any one any one i mean but fanny assingham i should have supposed you had had by this time particular means of learning i don t see she said why you ask me then after an instant and only after an instant as she saw he made out what she meant and it gave her all strangely enough the still further light that charlotte for herself knew as little as he had known the vision loomed in this light it fairly glared for the few seconds the vision of the two others alone together at fawns and charlotte as one of them having gropingly to go on always not knowing and not knowing the picture flushed at the same time with all its essential colour that of the so possible identity of her father s motive and principle with her own he was deep as amerigo called it so that no vibration of the still air should reach his daughter just as she had earned that description by making and by for that matter intending still to make her care for his serenity or at any rate for the firm outer shell of his dignity all marvellous enamel her paramount law more strangely even than anything else her husband seemed to speak now but to help her in this i know nothing but what you tell me then i ve told you all i intended find out the rest find it out he waited she stood before him a moment it took that time to go on depth upon depth of her situation as she met his face surged and sank within her but with the effect somehow once more that they rather lifted her than let her drop she had her feet somewhere through it all it was her companion absolutely who was at sea and she kept her feet she pressed them to what was beneath her she went over to the bell beside the chimney and gave a ring that he could but take as a summons for her maid it stopped everything for the present it was an intimation to him to go and dress but she had to insist find out for yourself part fifth xxxv after the little party was again constituted at fawns which had taken for completeness some ten days maggie naturally felt herself still more possessed in spirit of everything that had last happened in london there was a phrase that came back to her from old american years she was having by that idiom the time of her life she knew it by the perpetual throb of this sense of possession which was almost too violent either to recognise or to hide it was as if she had come out that was her most general consciousness out of a dark tunnel a dense wood or even simply a smoky room and had thereby at least for going on the advantage of air in her lungs it was as if she were somehow at last gathering in the fruits of patience she had either been really more patient than she had known at the time or had been so for longer the change brought about by itself as great a difference of view as the shift of an inch in the position of a telescope it was her telescope in fact that had gained in range just as her danger lay in her exposing herself to the observation by the more charmed and therefore the more reckless use of this optical resource not under any provocation to produce it in public was her unremitted rule but the difficulties of duplicity had not shrunk while the need of it had doubled humbugging which she had so practised with her father had been a comparatively simple matter on the basis of mere doubt but the ground to be covered was now greatly larger and she felt not unlike some young woman of the theatre who engaged for a minor part in the play and having mastered her cues with anxious effort should find herself suddenly promoted to leading lady and expected to appear in every act of the five she had made much to her husband that last night of her knowing but it was exactly this quantity she now knew that from the moment she could only dissimulate it added to her responsibility and made of the latter all a mere question of having something precious and precarious in charge there was no one to help her with it not even fanny assingham now this good friend s presence having become inevitably with that climax of their last interview in portland place a severely simplified function she had her use oh yes a thousand times but it could only consist henceforth in her quite conspicuously touching at no point whatever assuredly at least with maggie the matter they had discussed she was there inordinately as a value but as a value only for the clear negation of everything she was their general sign precisely of unimpaired beatitude and she was to live up to that somewhat arduous character poor thing as she might she might privately lapse from it if she must with amerigo or with charlotte only not of course ever so much as for the wink of an eye with the master of the house such lapses would be her own affair which maggie at present could take no thought of she treated her young friend meanwhile it was to be said to no betrayal of such wavering so that from the moment of her alighting at the door with the colonel everything went on between them at concert pitch what had she done that last evening in maggie s room but bring the husband and wife more together than as would seem they had ever been therefore what indiscretion should she not show by attempting to go behind the grand appearance of her success which would be to court a doubt of her beneficent work she knew accordingly nothing but harmony and diffused restlessly nothing but peace an extravagant expressive aggressive peace not incongruous after all with the solid calm of the place a kind of helmetted trident shaking pax britannica the peace it must be added had become as the days elapsed a peace quite generally animated and peopled thanks to that fact of the presence of company in which maggie s ability to preserve an appearance had learned from so far back to find its best resource it was not inconspicuous it was in fact striking that this resource just now seemed to meet in the highest degree every one s need quite as if every one were by the multiplication of human objects in the scene by the creation by the confusion of fictive issues hopeful of escaping somebody else s notice it had reached the point in truth that the collective bosom might have been taken to heave with the knowledge of the descent upon adjacent shores for a short period of mrs rance and the lutches still united and still so divided for conquest the sense of the party showed at least oddly enough as favourable to the fancy of the quaint turn that some near week end might derive from their reappearance this measured for maggie the ground they had all travelled together since that unforgotten afternoon of the none so distant year that determinant september sunday when sitting with her father in the park as in commemoration of the climax both of their old order and of their old danger she had proposed to him that they should call in charlotte call her in as a specialist might be summoned to an invalid s chair wasn t it a sign of something rather portentous their being ready to be beholden as for a diversion to the once despised kitty and dotty that had already had its application in truth to her invocation of the castledeans and several other members again of the historic matcham week made before she left town and made always consistently with an idea since she was never henceforth to approach these people without an idea and since that lurid element of their intercourse grew and grew for her with each occasion the flame with which it burned afresh during these particular days the way it held up the torch to anything to everything that might have occurred as the climax of revels springing from traditions so vivified this by itself justified her private motive and reconsecrated her diplomacy she had already produced by the aid of these people something of the effect she sought that of being good for whatever her companions were good for and of not asking either of them to give up anyone or anything for her sake there was moreover frankly a sharpness of point in it that she enjoyed it gave an accent to the truth she wished to illustrate the truth that the surface of her recent life thick sown with the flower of earnest endeavour with every form of the unruffled and the undoubting suffered no symptom anywhere to peep out it was as if under her pressure neither party could get rid of the complicity as it might be figured of the other as if in a word she saw amerigo and charlotte committed for fear of betrayals on their own side to a kind of wan consistency on the subject of lady castledean s set and this latter group by the same stroke compelled to assist at attestations the extent and bearing of which they rather failed to grasp and which left them indeed in spite of hereditary high spirits a trifle bewildered and even a trifle scared they made none the less at fawns for number for movement for sound they played their parts during a crisis that must have hovered for them in the long passages of the old house after the fashion of the established ghost felt through the dark hours as a constant possibility rather than have menaced them in the form of a daylight bore one of the perceived outsiders who are liable to be met in the drawing room or to be sat next to at dinner if the princess moreover had failed of her occult use for so much of the machinery of diversion she would still have had a sense not other than sympathetic for the advantage now extracted from it by fanny assingham s bruised philosophy this good friend s relation to it was actually the revanche she sufficiently indicated of her obscured lustre at matcham where she had known her way about so much less than most of the others she knew it at fawns through the pathless wild of the right tone positively better than any one maggie could note for her and her revenge had the magnanimity of a brave pointing out of it to every one else a wonderful irresistible conscious almost compassionate patronage here was a house she triumphantly caused it to be noted in which she so bristled with values that some of them might serve by her amused willingness to share for such of the temporarily vague among her fellow guests such of the dimly disconcerted as had lost the key to their own it may have been partly through the effect of this especial strain of community with her old friend that maggie found herself one evening moved to take up again their dropped directness of reference they had remained downstairs together late the other women of the party had filed singly or in couples up the grand staircase on which from the equally grand hall these retreats and advances could always be pleasantly observed the men had apparently taken their way to the smoking room while the princess in possession thus of a rare reach of view had lingered as if to enjoy it then she saw that mrs assingham was remaining a little and as for the appreciation of her enjoyment upon which they stood looking at each other across the cleared prospect until the elder woman only vaguely expressive and tentative now came nearer it was like the act of asking if there were anything she could yet do and that question was answered by her immediately feeling on this closer view as she had felt when presenting herself in portland place after maggie s last sharp summons their understanding was taken up by these new snatched moments where that occasion had left it he has never told her that i know of that i m at last satisfied and then as mrs assingham opened wide eyes i ve been in the dark since we came down not understanding what he has been doing or intending not making out what can have passed between them but within a day or two i ve begun to suspect and this evening for reasons oh too many to tell you i ve been sure since it explains nothing has passed between them that s what has happened it explains the princess repeated with energy it explains it explains she spoke in a manner that her auditor was afterwards to describe to the colonel oddly enough as that of the quietest excitement she had turned back to the chimney place where in honour of a damp day and a chill night the piled logs had turned to flame and sunk to embers and the evident intensity of her vision for the fact she imparted made fanny assingham wait upon her words it explained this striking fact more indeed than her companion though conscious of fairly gaping with good will could swallow at once the princess however as for indulgence and confidence quickly filled up the measure he hasn t let her know that i know and clearly doesn t mean to he has made up his mind he ll say nothing about it therefore as she s quite unable to arrive at the knowledge by herself she has no idea how much i m really in possession she believes said maggie and so far as her own conviction goes she knows that i m not in possession of anything and that somehow for my own help seems to me immense immense my dear mrs assingham applausively murmured though not quite even as yet seeing all the way he s keeping quiet then on purpose on purpose maggie s lighted eyes at least looked further than they had ever looked he ll never tell her now fanny wondered she cast about her most of all she admired her little friend in whom this announcement was evidently animated by an heroic lucidity she stood there in her full uniform like some small erect commander of a siege an anxious captain who has suddenly got news replete with importance for him of agitation of division within the place this importance breathed upon her comrade so you re all right oh all right s a good deal to say but i seem at least to see as i haven t before where i am with it fanny bountifully brooded there was a point left vague and you have it from him your husband himself has told you told me why what you speak of it isn t of an assurance received from him then that you do speak at which maggie had continued to stare dear me no do you suppose i ve asked him for an assurance ah you haven t her companion smiled that s what i supposed you might mean then darling what have you asked him for i ve asked him for nothing but this in turn made fanny stare then nothing that evening of the embassy dinner passed between you on the contrary everything passed everything everything i told him what i knew and i told him how i knew it mrs assingham waited and that was all wasn t it quite enough oh love she bridled that s for you to have judged then i have judged said maggie i did judge i made sure he understood then i let him alone mrs assingham wondered but he didn t explain explain thank god no maggie threw back her head as with horror at the thought then the next moment added and i didn t either the decency of pride in it shed a cold little light yet as from heights at the base of which her companion rather panted but if he neither denies nor confesses he does what s a thousand times better he lets it alone he does maggie went on as he would do as i see now that i was sure he would he lets me alone fanny assingham turned it over then how do you know so where as you say you are why just by that i put him in possession of the difference the difference made about me by the fact that i hadn t been after all though with a wonderful chance i admitted helping me too stupid to have arrived at knowledge he had to see that i m changed for him quite changed from the idea of me that he had so long been going on with it became a question then of his really taking in the change and what i now see is that he is doing so fanny followed as she could which he shows by letting you as you say alone maggie looked at her a minute and by letting her mrs assingham did what she might to embrace it checked a little however by a thought that was the nearest approach she could have in this almost too large air to an inspiration ah but does charlotte let him oh that s another affair with which i ve practically nothing to do i dare say however she doesn t and the princess had a more distant gaze for the image evoked by the question i don t in fact well see how she can but the point for me is that he understands yes fanny assingham cooed understands well what i want i want a happiness without a hole in it big enough for you to poke in your finger a brilliant perfect surface to begin with at least i see the golden bowl as it was to have been and maggie dwelt musingly on this obscured figure the bowl with all our happiness in it the bowl without the crack for mrs assingham too the image had its force and the precious object shone before her again reconstituted plausible presentable but wasn t there still a piece missing yet if he lets you alone and you only let him mayn t our doing so you mean be noticed mayn t it give us away well we hope not we try not we take such care we alone know what s between us we and you and haven t you precisely been struck since you ve been here maggie asked with our making so good a show her friend hesitated to your father but it made her hesitate too she wouldn t speak of her father directly to everyone to her now that you understand it held poor fanny again in wonder to charlotte yes if there s so much beneath it for you and if it s all such a plan that makes it hang together it makes you hang together she fairly exhaled her admiration you re like nobody else you re extraordinary maggie met it with appreciation but with a reserve no i m not extraordinary but i am for every one quiet well that s just what is extraordinary quiet is more than i am and you leave me far behind with which again for an instant mrs assingham frankly brooded now that i understand you say but there s one thing i don t understand and the next minute while her companion waited she had mentioned it how can charlotte after all not have pressed him not have attacked him about it how can she not have asked him asked him on his honour i mean if you know how can she not why of course said the princess limpidly she must well then well then you think he must have told her why exactly what i mean said maggie is that he will have done nothing of the sort will as i say have maintained the contrary fanny assingham weighed it under her direct appeal for the truth under her direct appeal for the truth her appeal to his honour her appeal to his honour that s my point fanny assingham braved it for the truth as from him to her from him to any one mrs assingham s face lighted he ll simply he ll insistently have lied maggie brought it out roundly he ll simply he ll insistently have lied it held again her companion who next however with a single movement throwing herself on her neck overflowed oh if you knew how you help me maggie had liked her to understand so far as this was possible but had not been slow to see afterwards how the possibility was limited when one came to think by mysteries she was not to sound this inability in her was indeed not remarkable inasmuch as the princess herself as we have seen was only now in a position to boast of touching bottom maggie lived inwardly in a consciousness that she could but partly open even to so good a friend and her own visitation of the fuller expanse of which was for that matter still going on they had been duskier still however these recesses of her imagination that no doubt was what might at present be said for them she had looked into them on the eve of her leaving town almost without penetration she had made out in those hours and also of a truth during the days which immediately followed little more than the strangeness of a relation having for its chief mark whether to be prolonged or not the absence of any intimate result of the crisis she had invited her husband to recognise they had dealt with this crisis again face to face very briefly the morning after the scene in her room but with the odd consequence of her having appeared merely to leave it on his hands he had received it from her as he might have received a bunch of keys or a list of commissions attentive to her instructions about them but only putting them for the time very carefully and safely into his pocket the instructions had seemed from day to day to make so little difference for his behaviour that is for his speech or his silence to produce as yet so little of the fruit of action he had taken from her on the spot in a word before going to dress for dinner all she then had to give after which on the morrow he had asked her for more a good deal as if she might have renewed her supply during the night but he had had at his command for this latter purpose an air of extraordinary detachment and discretion an air amounting really to an appeal which if she could have brought herself to describe it vulgarly she would have described as cool just as he himself would have described it in any one else as cheeky a suggestion that she should trust him on the particular ground since she didn t on the general neither his speech nor his silence struck her as signifying more or less under this pressure than they had seemed to signify for weeks past yet if her sense hadn t been absolutely closed to the possibility in him of any thought of wounding her she might have taken his undisturbed manner the perfection of his appearance of having recovered himself for one of those intentions of high impertinence by the aid of which great people les grands seigneurs persons of her husband s class and type always know how to re establish a violated order it was her one purely good fortune that she could feel thus sure impertinence to her at any rate was not among the arts on which he proposed to throw himself for though he had in so almost mystifying a manner replied to nothing denied nothing explained nothing apologised for nothing he had somehow conveyed to her that this was not because of any determination to treat her case as not worth it there had been consideration on both occasions in the way he had listened to her even though at the same time there had been extreme reserve a reserve indeed it was also to be remembered qualified by the fact that on their second and shorter interview in portland place and quite at the end of this passage she had imagined him positively proposing to her a temporary accommodation it had been but the matter of something in the depths of the eyes he finally fixed upon her and she had found in it the more she kept it before her the tacitly offered sketch of a working arrangement leave me my reserve don t question it it s all i have just now don t you see so that if you ll make me the concession of letting me alone with it for as long a time as i require i promise you something or other grown under cover of it even though i don t yet quite make out what as a return for your patience she had turned away from him with some such unspoken words as that in her ear and indeed she had to represent to herself that she had spiritually heard them had to listen to them still again to explain her particular patience in face of his particular failure he hadn t so much as pretended to meet for an instant the question raised by her of her accepted ignorance of the point in time the period before their own marriage from which his intimacy with charlotte dated as an ignorance in which he and charlotte had been personally interested and to the pitch of consummately protecting for years each other s interest as a condition so imposed upon her the fact of its having ceased might have made it on the spot the first article of his defence he had vouchsafed it however nothing better than his longest stare of postponed consideration that tribute he had coldly paid it and maggie might herself have been stupefied truly had she not had something to hold on by at her own present ability even provisional to make terms with a chapter of history into which she could but a week before not have dipped without a mortal chill at the rate at which she was living she was getting used hour by hour to these extensions of view and when she asked herself at fawns to what single observation of her own in london the prince had had an affirmation to oppose she but just failed to focus the small strained wife of the moments in question as some panting dancer of a difficult step who had capered before the footlights of an empty theatre to a spectator lounging in a box her best comprehension of amerigo s success in not committing himself was in her recall meanwhile of the inquiries he had made of her on their only return to the subject and which he had in fact explicitly provoked their return in order to make he had had it over with her again the so distinctly remarkable incident of her interview at home with the little bloomsbury shopman this anecdote for him had not altogether surprisingly required some straighter telling and the prince s attitude in presence of it had represented once more his nearest approach to a cross examination the difficulty in respect to the little man had been for the question of his motive his motive in writing first in the spirit of retraction to a lady with whom he had made a most advantageous bargain and in then coming to see her so that his apology should be personal maggie had felt her explanation weak but there were the facts and she could give no other left alone after the transaction with the knowledge that his visitor designed the object bought of him as a birthday gift to her father for maggie confessed freely to having chattered to him almost as to a friend the vendor of the golden bowl had acted on a scruple rare enough in vendors of any class and almost unprecedented in the thrifty children of israel he hadn t liked what he had done and what he had above all made such a good thing of having done at the thought of his purchaser s good faith and charming presence opposed to that flaw in her acquestion which would make it verily as an offering to a loved parent a thing of sinister meaning and evil effect he had known conscientious he had known superstitious visitings had given way to a whim all the more remarkable to his own commercial mind no doubt from its never having troubled him in other connexions she had recognised the oddity of her adventure and left it to show for what it was she had not been unconscious on the other hand that if it hadn t touched amerigo so nearly he would have found in it matter for some amused reflection he had uttered an extraordinary sound something between a laugh and a howl on her saying as she had made a point of doing oh most certainly he told me his reason was because he liked me though she remained in doubt of whether that inarticulate comment had been provoked most by the familiarities she had offered or by those that so pictured she had had to endure that the partner of her bargain had yearned to see her again that he had plainly jumped at a pretext for it this also she had frankly expressed herself to the prince as having in no snubbing no scandalised but rather in a positively appreciative and indebted spirit not delayed to make out he had wished ever so seriously to return her a part of her money and she had wholly declined to receive it and then he had uttered his hope that she had not at all events already devoted the crystal cup to the beautiful purpose she had so kindly and so fortunately named to him it wasn t a thing for a present to a person she was fond of for she wouldn t wish to give a present that would bring ill luck that had come to him so that he couldn t rest and he should feel better now that he had told her his having led her to act in ignorance was what he should have been ashamed of and if she would pardon gracious lady as she was all the liberties he had taken she might make of the bowl any use in life but that one it was after this that the most extraordinary incident of all of course had occurred his pointing to the two photographs with the remark that those were persons he knew and that more wonderful still he had made acquaintance with them years before precisely over the same article the lady on that occasion had taken up the fancy of presenting it to the gentleman and the gentleman guessing and dodging ever so cleverly had declared that he wouldn t for the world receive an object under such suspicion he himself the little man had confessed wouldn t have minded about them but he had never forgotten either their talk or their faces the impression altogether made by them and if she really wished to know now what had perhaps most moved him it was the thought that she should ignorantly have gone in for a thing not good enough for other buyers he had been immensely struck that was another point with this accident of their turning out after so long friends of hers too they had disappeared and this was the only light he had ever had upon them he had flushed up quite red with his recognition with all his responsibility had declared that the connexion must have had mysteriously something to do with the impulse he had obeyed and maggie had made to her husband while he again stood before her no secret of the shock for herself so suddenly and violently received she had done her best even while taking it full in the face not to give herself away but she wouldn t answer no she wouldn t for what she might in her agitation have made her informant think he might think what he would there had been three or four minutes during which while she asked him question upon question she had doubtless too little cared and he had spoken for his remembrance as fully as she could have wished he had spoken oh delightedly for the terms on which his other visitors had appeared to be with each other and in fact for that conviction of the nature and degree of their intimacy under which in spite of precautions they hadn t been able to help leaving him he had observed and judged and not forgotten he had been sure they were great people but no ah no distinctly hadn t liked them as he liked the signora principessa certainly she had created no vagueness about that he had been in possession of her name and address for sending her both her cup and her account but the others he had only always wondered about he had been sure they would never come back and as to the time of their visit he could place it positively to a day by reason of a transaction of importance recorded in his books that had occurred but a few hours later he had left her in short definitely rejoicing that he had been able to make up to her for not having been quite square over their little business by rendering her so unexpectedly the service of this information his joy moreover was as much as amerigo would a matter of the personal interest with which her kindness gentleness grace her charming presence and easy humanity and familiarity had inspired him all of which while in thought maggie went over it again and again oh over any imputable rashness of her own immediate passion and pain as well as over the rest of the straight little story she had after all to tell might very conceivably make a long sum for the prince to puzzle out there were meanwhile after the castledeans and those invited to meet them had gone and before mrs rance and the lutches had come three or four days during which she was to learn the full extent of her need not to be penetrable and then it was indeed that she felt all the force and threw herself upon all the help of the truth she had confided several nights earlier to fanny assingham she had known it in advance had warned herself of it while the house was full charlotte had designs upon her of a nature best known to herself and was only waiting for the better opportunity of their finding themselves less companioned this consciousness had been exactly at the bottom of maggie s wish to multiply their spectators there were moments for her positively moments of planned postponement of evasion scarcely less disguised than studied during which she turned over with anxiety the different ways there being two or three possible ones in which her young stepmother might at need seek to work upon her amerigo s not having told her of his passage with his wife gave for maggie altogether a new aspect to charlotte s consciousness and condition an aspect with which for apprehension for wonder and even at moments inconsequently enough for something like compassion the princess had now to reckon she asked herself for she was capable of that what he had meant by keeping the sharer of his guilt in the dark about a matter touching her otherwise so nearly what he had meant that is for this unmistakably mystified personage herself maggie could imagine what he had meant for her all sorts of thinkable things whether things of mere form or things of sincerity things of pity or things of prudence he had meant for instance in all probability primarily to conjure away any such appearance of a changed relation between the two women as his father in law might notice and follow up it would have been open to him however given the pitch of their intimacy to avert this danger by some more conceivable course with charlotte since an earnest warning in fact the full freedom of alarm that of his insisting to her on the peril of suspicion incurred and on the importance accordingly of outward peace at any price would have been the course really most conceivable instead of warning and advising he had reassured and deceived her so that our young woman who had been from far back by the habit if her nature as much on her guard against sacrificing others as if she felt the great trap of life mainly to be set for one s doing so now found herself attaching her fancy to that side of the situation of the exposed pair which involved for themselves at least the sacrifice of the least fortunate she never at present thought of what amerigo might be intending without the reflection by the same stroke that whatever this quantity he was leaving still more to her own ingenuity he was helping her when the thing came to the test only by the polished possibly almost too polished surface his manner to his wife wore for an admiring world and that surely was entitled to scarcely more than the praise of negative diplomacy he was keeping his manner right as she had related to mrs assingham the case would have been beyond calculation truly if on top of everything he had allowed it to go wrong she had hours of exaltation indeed when the meaning of all this pressed in upon her as a tacit vow from him to abide without question by whatever she should be able to achieve or think fit to prescribe then it was that even while holding her breath for the awe of it she truly felt almost able enough for anything it was as if she had passed in a time incredibly short from being nothing for him to being all it was as if rightly noted every turn of his head every tone of his voice in these days might mean that there was but one way in which a proud man reduced to abjection could hold himself during those of maggie s vigils in which that view loomed largest the image of her husband that it thus presented to her gave out a beauty for the revelation of which she struck herself as paying if anything all too little to make sure of it to make sure of the beauty shining out of the humility and of the humility lurking in all the pride of his presence she would have gone the length of paying more yet of paying with difficulties and anxieties compared to which those actually before her might have been as superficial as headaches or rainy days the point at which these exaltations dropped however was the point at which it was apt to come over her that if her complications had been greater the question of paying would have been limited still less to the liabilities of her own pocket the complications were verily great enough whether for ingenuities or sublimities so long as she had to come back to it so often that charlotte all the while could only be struggling with secrets sharper than her own it was odd how that certainty again and again determined and coloured her wonderments of detail the question for instance of how amerigo in snatched opportunities of conference put the haunted creature off with false explanations met her particular challenges and evaded if that was what he did do her particular demands even the conviction that charlotte was but awaiting some chance really to test her trouble upon her lover s wife left maggie s sense meanwhile open as to the sight of gilt wires and bruised wings the spacious but suspended cage the home of eternal unrest of pacings beatings shakings all so vain into which the baffled consciousness helplessly resolved itself the cage was the deluded condition and maggie as having known delusion rather understood the nature of cages she walked round charlotte s cautiously and in a very wide circle and when inevitably they had to communicate she felt herself comparatively outside on the breast of nature and saw her companion s face as that of a prisoner looking through bars so it was that through bars bars richly gilt but firmly though discreetly planted charlotte finally struck her as making a grim attempt from which at first the princess drew back as instinctively as if the door of the cage had suddenly been opened from within xxxvi they had been alone that evening alone as a party of six and four of them after dinner under suggestion not to be resisted sat down to bridge in the smoking room they had passed together to that apartment on rising from table charlotte and mrs assingham alike indulgent always to tobacco and in fact practising an emulation which as fanny said would for herself had the colonel not issued an interdict based on the fear of her stealing his cigars have stopped only at the short pipe here cards had with inevitable promptness asserted their rule the game forming itself as had often happened before of mr verver with mrs assingham for partner and of the prince with mrs verver the colonel who had then asked of maggie license to relieve his mind of a couple of letters for the earliest post out on the morrow was addressing himself to this task at the other end of the room and the princess herself had welcomed the comparatively hushed hour for the bridge players were serious and silent much in the mood of a tired actress who has the good fortune to be off while her mates are on almost long enough for a nap on the property sofa in the wing maggie s nap had she been able to snatch forty winks would have been of the spirit rather than of the sense yet as she subsided near a lamp with the last salmon coloured french periodical she was to fail for refreshment even of that sip of independence there was no question for her as she found of closing her eyes and getting away they strayed back to life in the stillness over the top of her review she could lend herself to none of those refinements of the higher criticism with which its pages bristled she was there where her companions were there again and more than ever there it was as if of a sudden they had been made in their personal intensity and their rare complexity of relation freshly importunate to her it was the first evening there had been no one else mrs rance and the lutches were due the next day but meanwhile the facts of the situation were upright for her round the green cloth and the silver flambeaux the fact of her father s wife s lover facing his mistress the fact of her father sitting all unsounded and unblinking between them the fact of charlotte keeping it up keeping up everything across the table with her husband beside her the fact of fanny assingham wonderful creature placed opposite to the three and knowing more about each probably when one came to think than either of them knew of either erect above all for her was the sharp edged fact of the relation of the whole group individually and collectively to herself herself so speciously eliminated for the hour but presumably more present to the attention of each than the next card to be played yes under that imputation to her sense they sat the imputation of wondering beneath and behind all their apparently straight play if she weren t really watching them from her corner and consciously as might be said holding them in her hand she was asking herself at last how they could bear it for though cards were as nought to her and she could follow no move so that she was always on such occasions out of the party they struck her as conforming alike in the matter of gravity and propriety to the stiff standard of the house her father she knew was a high adept one of the greatest she had been ever in her stupidity his small his sole despair amerigo excelled easily as he understood and practised every art that could beguile large leisure mrs assingham and charlotte moreover were accounted as good as members of a sex incapable of the nobler consistency could be therefore evidently they were not all so up to their usual form merely passing it off whether for her or for themselves and the amount of enjoyed or at least achieved security represented by so complete a conquest of appearances was what acted on her nerves precisely with a kind of provocative force she found herself for five minutes thrilling with the idea of the prodigious effect that just as she sat there near them she had at her command with the sense that if she were but different oh ever so different all this high decorum would hang by a hair there reigned for her absolutely during these vertiginous moments that fascination of the monstrous that temptation of the horribly possible which we so often trace by its breaking out suddenly lest it should go further in unexplained retreats and reactions after it had been thus vividly before her for a little that springing up under her wrong and making them all start stare and turn pale she might sound out their doom in a single sentence a sentence easy to choose among several of the lurid after she had faced that blinding light and felt it turn to blackness she rose from her place laying aside her magazine and moved slowly round the room passing near the card players and pausing an instant behind the chairs in turn silent and discreet she bent a vague mild face upon them as if to signify that little as she followed their doings she wished them well and she took from each across the table in the common solemnity an upward recognition which she was to carry away with her on her moving out to the terrace a few minutes later her father and her husband mrs assingham and charlotte had done nothing but meet her eyes yet the difference in these demonstrations made each a separate passage which was all the more wonderful since with the secret behind every face they had alike tried to look at her through it and in denial of it it all left her as she wandered off with the strangest of impressions the sense forced upon her as never yet of an appeal a positive confidence from the four pairs of eyes that was deeper than any negation and that seemed to speak on the part of each of some relation to be contrived by her a relation with herself which would spare the individual the danger the actual present strain of the relation with the others they thus tacitly put it upon her to be disposed of the whole complexity of their peril and she promptly saw why because she was there and there just as she was to lift it off them and take it to charge herself with it as the scapegoat of old of whom she had once seen a terrible picture had been charged with the sins of the people and had gone forth into the desert to sink under his burden and die that indeed wasn t their design and their interest that she should sink under hers it wouldn t be their feeling that she should do anything but live live on somehow for their benefit and even as much as possible in their company to keep proving to them that they had truly escaped and that she was still there to simplify this idea of her simplifying and of their combined struggle dim as yet but steadily growing toward the perception of her adopting it from them clung to her while she hovered on the terrace where the summer night was so soft that she scarce needed the light shawl she had picked up several of the long windows of the occupied rooms stood open to it and the light came out in vague shafts and fell upon the old smooth stones the hour was moonless and starless and the air heavy and still which was why in her evening dress she need fear no chill and could get away in the outer darkness from that provocation of opportunity which had assaulted her within on her sofa as a beast might have leaped at her throat nothing in fact was stranger than the way in which when she had remained there a little her companions watched by her through one of the windows actually struck her as almost consciously and gratefully safer they might have been really charming as they showed in the beautiful room and charlotte certainly as always magnificently handsome and supremely distinguished they might have been figures rehearsing some play of which she herself was the author they might even for the happy appearance they continued to present have been such figures as would by the strong note of character in each fill any author with the certitude of success especially of their own histrionic they might in short have represented any mystery they would the point being predominantly that the key to the mystery the key that could wind and unwind it without a snap of the spring was there in her pocket or rather no doubt clasped at this crisis in her hand and pressed as she walked back and forth to her breast she walked to the end and far out of the light she returned and saw the others still where she had left them she passed round the house and looked into the drawing room lighted also but empty now and seeming to speak the more in its own voice of all the possibilities she controlled spacious and splendid like a stage again awaiting a drama it was a scene she might people by the press of her spring either with serenities and dignities and decencies or with terrors and shames and ruins things as ugly as those formless fragments of her golden bowl she was trying so hard to pick up she continued to walk and continued to pause she stopped afresh for the look into the smoking room and by this time it was as if the recognition had of itself arrested her she saw as in a picture with the temptation she had fled from quite extinct why it was she had been able to give herself so little from the first to the vulgar heat of her wrong she might fairly as she watched them have missed it as a lost thing have yearned for it for the straight vindictive view the rights of resentment the rages of jealousy the protests of passion as for something she had been cheated of not least a range of feelings which for many women would have meant so much but which for her husband s wife for her father s daughter figured nothing nearer to experience than a wild eastern caravan looming into view with crude colours in the sun fierce pipes in the air high spears against the sky all a thrill a natural joy to mingle with but turning off short before it reached her and plunging into other defiles she saw at all events why horror itself had almost failed her the horror that foreshadowed in advance would by her thought have made everything that was unaccustomed in her cry out with pain the horror of finding evil seated all at its ease where she had only dreamed of good the horror of the thing hideously behind behind so much trusted so much pretended nobleness cleverness tenderness it was the first sharp falsity she had known in her life to touch at all or be touched by it had met her like some bad faced stranger surprised in one of the thick carpeted corridors of a house of quiet on a sunday afternoon and yet yes amazingly she had been able to look at terror and disgust only to know that she must put away from her the bitter sweet of their freshness the sight from the window of the group so constituted told her why told her how named to her as with hard lips named straight at her so that she must take it full in the face that other possible relation to the whole fact which alone would bear upon her irresistibly it was extraordinary they positively brought home to her that to feel about them in any of the immediate inevitable assuaging ways the ways usually open to innocence outraged and generosity betrayed would have been to give them up and that giving them up was marvellously not to be thought of she had never from the first hour of her state of acquired conviction given them up so little as now though she was no doubt as the consequence of a step taken a few minutes later to invoke the conception of doing that if might be even less she had resumed her walk stopping here and there while she rested on the cool smooth stone balustrade to draw it out in the course of which after a little she passed again the lights of the empty drawing room and paused again for what she saw and felt there it was not at once however that this became quite concrete that was the effect of her presently making out that charlotte was in the room launched and erect there in the middle and looking about her that she had evidently just come round to it from her card table by one of the passages with the expectation to all appearance of joining her stepdaughter she had pulled up at seeing the great room empty maggie not having passed out on leaving the group in a manner to be observed so definite a quest of her with the bridge party interrupted or altered for it was an impression that fairly assailed the princess and to which something of attitude and aspect of the air of arrested pursuit and purpose in charlotte together with the suggestion of her next vague movements quickly added its meaning this meaning was that she had decided that she had been infinitely conscious of maggie s presence before that she knew that she would at last find her alone and that she wanted her for some reason enough to have presumably called on bob assingham for aid he had taken her chair and let her go and the arrangement was for maggie a signal proof of her earnestness of the energy in fact that though superficially commonplace in a situation in which people weren t supposed to be watching each other was what affected our young woman on the spot as a breaking of bars the splendid shining supple creature was out of the cage was at large and the question now almost grotesquely rose of whether she mightn t by some art just where she was and before she could go further be hemmed in and secured it would have been for a moment in this case a matter of quickly closing the windows and giving the alarm with poor maggie s sense that though she couldn t know what she wanted of her it was enough for trepidation that at these firm hands anything should be to say nothing of the sequel of a flight taken again along the terrace even under the shame of the confessed feebleness of such evasions on the part of an outraged wife it was to this feebleness none the less that the outraged wife had presently resorted the most that could be said for her being as she felt while she finally stopped short at a distance that she could at any rate resist her abjection sufficiently not to sneak into the house by another way and safely reach her room she had literally caught herself in the act of dodging and ducking and it told her there vividly in a single word what she had all along been most afraid of she had been afraid of the particular passage with charlotte that would determine her father s wife to take him into her confidence as she couldn t possibly as yet have done to prepare for him a statement of her wrong to lay before him the infamy of what she was apparently suspected of this should she have made up her mind to do it would rest on a calculation the thought of which evoked strangely other possibilities and visions it would show her as sufficiently believing in her grasp of her husband to be able to assure herself that with his daughter thrown on the defensive with maggie s cause and maggie s word in fine against her own it wasn t maggie s that would most certainly carry the day such a glimpse of her conceivable idea which would be founded on reasons all her own reasons of experience and assurance impenetrable to others but intimately familiar to herself such a glimpse opened out wide as soon as it had come into view for if so much as this was still firm ground between the elder pair if the beauty of appearances had been so consistently preserved it was only the golden bowl as maggie herself knew it that had been broken the breakage stood not for any wrought discomposure among the triumphant three it stood merely for the dire deformity of her attitude toward them she was unable at the minute of course fully to measure the difference thus involved for her and it remained inevitably an agitating image the way it might be held over her that if she didn t of her own prudence satisfy charlotte as to the reference in her mocking spirit of so much of the unuttered and unutterable of the constantly and unmistakably implied her father would be invited without further ceremony to recommend her to do so but any confidence any latent operating insolence that mrs verver should thanks to her large native resources continue to be possessed of and to hold in reserve glimmered suddenly as a possible working light and seemed to offer for meeting her a new basis and something like a new system maggie felt truly a rare contraction of the heart on making out the next instant what the new system would probably have to be and she had practically done that before perceiving that the thing she feared had already taken place charlotte extending her search appeared now to define herself vaguely in the distance of this after an instant the princess was sure though the darkness was thick for the projected clearness of the smoking room windows had presently contributed its help her friend came slowly into that circle having also for herself by this time not indistinguishably discovered that maggie was on the terrace maggie from the end saw her stop before one of the windows to look at the group within and then saw her come nearer and pause again still with a considerable length of the place between them yes charlotte had seen she was watching her from afar and had stopped now to put her further attention to the test her face was fixed on her through the night she was the creature who had escaped by force from her cage yet there was in her whole motion assuredly even as so dimly discerned a kind of portentous intelligent stillness she had escaped with an intention but with an intention the more definite that it could so accord with quiet measures the two women at all events only hovered there for these first minutes face to face over their interval and exchanging no sign the intensity of their mutual look might have pierced the night and maggie was at last to start with the scared sense of having thus yielded to doubt to dread to hesitation for a time that with no other proof needed would have completely given her away how long had she stood staring a single minute or five long enough in any case to have felt herself absolutely take from her visitor something that the latter threw upon her irresistibly by this effect of silence by this effect of waiting and watching by this effect unmistakably of timing her indecision and her fear if then scared and hanging back she had as was so evident sacrificed all past pretences it would have been with the instant knowledge of an immense advantage gained that charlotte finally saw her come on maggie came on with her heart in her hands she came on with the definite prevision throbbing like the tick of a watch of a doom impossibly sharp and hard but to which after looking at it with her eyes wide open she had none the less bowed her head by the time she was at her companion s side for that matter by the time charlotte had without a motion without a word simply let her approach and stand there her head was already on the block so that the consciousness that everything had now gone blurred all perception of whether or no the axe had fallen oh the advantage it was perfectly enough in truth with mrs verver for what was maggie s own sense but that of having been thrown over on her back with her neck from the first half broken and her helpless face staring up that position only could account for the positive grimace of weakness and pain produced there by charlotte s dignity i ve come to join you i thought you would be here oh yes i m here maggie heard herself return a little flatly it s too close in doors very but close even here charlotte was still and grave she had even uttered her remark about the temperature with an expressive weight that verged upon solemnity so that maggie reduced to looking vaguely about at the sky could only feel her not fail of her purpose the air s heavy as if with thunder i think there ll be a storm she made the suggestion to carry off an awkwardness which was a part always of her companion s gain but the awkwardness didn t diminish in the silence that followed charlotte had said nothing in reply her brow was dark as with a fixed expression and her high elegance her handsome head and long straight neck testified through the dusk to their inveterate completeness and noble erectness it was as if what she had come out to do had already begun and when as a consequence maggie had said helplessly don t you want something won t you have my shawl everything might have crumbled away in the comparative poverty of the tribute mrs verver s rejection of it had the brevity of a sign that they hadn t closed in for idle words just as her dim serious face uninterruptedly presented until they moved again might have represented the success with which she watched all her message penetrate they presently went back the way she had come but she stopped maggie again within range of the smoking room window and made her stand where the party at cards would be before her side by side for three minutes they fixed this picture of quiet harmonies the positive charm of it and as might have been said the full significance which as was now brought home to maggie could be no more after all than a matter of interpretation differing always for a different interpreter as she herself had hovered in sight of it a quarter of an hour before it would have been a thing for her to show charlotte to show in righteous irony in reproach too stern for anything but silence but now it was she who was being shown it and shown it by charlotte and she saw quickly enough that as charlotte showed it so she must at present submissively seem to take it the others were absorbed and unconscious either silent over their game or dropping remarks unheard on the terrace and it was to her father s quiet face discernibly expressive of nothing that was in his daughter s mind that our young woman s attention was most directly given his wife and his daughter were both closely watching him and to which of them could he have been notified of this would his raised eyes first all impulsively have responded in which of them would he have felt it most important to destroy for his clutch at the equilibrium any germ of uneasiness not yet since his marriage had maggie so sharply and so formidably known her old possession of him as a thing divided and contested she was looking at him by charlotte s leave and under charlotte s direction quite in fact as if the particular way she should look at him were prescribed to her quite even as if she had been defied to look at him in any other it came home to her too that the challenge wasn t as might be said in his interest and for his protection but pressingly insistently in charlotte s for that of her security at any price she might verily by this dumb demonstration have been naming to maggie the price naming it as a question for maggie herself a sum of money that she properly was to find she must remain safe and maggie must pay what she was to pay with being her own affair straighter than ever thus the princess again felt it all put upon her and there was a minute just a supreme instant during which there burned in her a wild wish that her father would only look up it throbbed for these seconds as a yearning appeal to him she would chance it that is if he would but just raise his eyes and catch them across the larger space standing in the outer dark together then he might be affected by the sight taking them as they were he might make some sign she scarce knew what that would save her save her from being the one this way to pay all he might somehow show a preference distinguishing between them might out of pity for her signal to her that this extremity of her effort for him was more than he asked that represented maggie s one little lapse from consistency the sole small deflection in the whole course of her scheme it had come to nothing the next minute for the dear man s eyes had never moved and charlotte s hand promptly passed into her arm had already had very firmly drawn her on quite for that matter as from some sudden some equal perception on her part too of the more ways than one in which their impression could appeal they retraced their steps along the rest of the terrace turning the corner of the house and presently came abreast of the other windows those of the pompous drawing room still lighted and still empty here charlotte again paused and it was again as if she were pointing out what maggie had observed for herself the very look the place had of being vivid in its stillness of having with all its great objects as ordered and balanced as for a formal reception been appointed for some high transaction some real affair of state in presence of this opportunity she faced her companion once more she traced in her the effect of everything she had already communicated she signified with the same success that the terrace and the sullen night would bear too meagre witness to the completion of her idea soon enough then within the room under the old lustres of venice and the eyes of the several great portraits more or less contemporary with these that awaited on the walls of fawns their final far migration soon enough maggie found herself staring and at first all too gaspingly at the grand total to which each separate demand mrs verver had hitherto made upon her however she had made it now amounted i ve been wanting and longer than you d perhaps believe to put a question to you for which no opportunity has seemed to me yet quite so good as this it would have been easier perhaps if you had struck me as in the least disposed ever to give me one i have to take it now you see as i find it they stood in the centre of the immense room and maggie could feel that the scene of life her imagination had made of it twenty minutes before was by this time sufficiently peopled these few straight words filled it to its uttermost reaches and nothing was now absent from her consciousness either of the part she was called upon to play in it charlotte had marched straight in dragging her rich train she rose there beautiful and free with her whole aspect and action attuned to the firmness of her speech maggie had kept the shawl she had taken out with her and clutching it tight in her nervousness drew it round her as if huddling in it for shelter covering herself with it for humility she looked out as from under an improvised hood the sole headgear of some poor woman at somebody s proud door she waited even like the poor woman she met her friend s eyes with recognitions she couldn t suppress she might sound it as she could what question then everything in her from head to foot crowded it upon charlotte that she knew she knew too well that she was showing so that successful vagueness to save some scrap of her dignity from the imminence of her defeat was already a lost cause and the one thing left was if possible at any cost even that of stupid inconsequence to try to look as if she weren t afraid if she could but appear at all not afraid she might appear a little not ashamed that is not ashamed to be afraid which was the kind of shame that could be fastened on her it being fear all the while that moved her her challenge at any rate her wonder her terror the blank blurred surface whatever it was that she presented became a mixture that ceased to signify for to the accumulated advantage by which charlotte was at present sustained her next words themselves had little to add have you any ground of complaint of me is there any wrong you consider i ve done you i feel at last that i ve a right to ask you their eyes had to meet on it and to meet long maggie s avoided at least the disgrace of looking away what makes you want to ask it my natural desire to know you ve done that for so long little justice maggie waited a moment for so long you mean you ve thought i mean my dear that i ve seen i ve seen week after week that you seemed to be thinking of something that perplexed or worried you is it anything for which i m in any degree responsible maggie summoned all her powers what in the world should it be ah that s not for me to imagine and i should be very sorry to have to try to say i m aware of no point whatever at which i may have failed you said charlotte nor of any at which i may have failed any one in whom i can suppose you sufficiently interested to care if i ve been guilty of some fault i ve committed it all unconsciously and am only anxious to hear from you honestly about it but if i ve been mistaken as to what i speak of the difference more and more marked as i ve thought in all your manner to me why obviously so much the better no form of correction received from you could give me greater satisfaction she spoke it struck her companion with rising with extraordinary ease as if hearing herself say it all besides seeing the way it was listened to helped her from point to point she saw she was right that this was the tone for her to take and the thing for her to do the thing as to which she was probably feeling that she had in advance in her delays and uncertainties much exaggerated the difficulty the difficulty was small and it grew smaller as her adversary continued to shrink she was not only doing as she wanted but had by this time effectively done it and hung it up all of which but deepened maggie s sense of the sharp and simple need now of seeing her through to the end if you ve been mistaken you say and the princess but barely faltered you have been mistaken charlotte looked at her splendidly hard you re perfectly sure it s all my mistake all i can say is that you ve received a false impression ah then so much the better from the moment i had received it i knew i must sooner or later speak of it for that you see is systematically my way and now charlotte added you make me glad i ve spoken i thank you very much it was strange how for maggie too with this the difficulty seemed to sink her companion s acceptance of her denial was like a general pledge not to keep things any worse for her than they essentially had to be it positively helped her to build up her falsehood to which accordingly she contributed another block i ve affected you evidently quite accidentally in some way of which i ve been all unaware i ve not felt at any time that you ve wronged me how could i come within a mile charlotte inquired of such a possibility maggie with her eyes on her more easily now made no attempt to say she said after a little something more to the present point i accuse you i accuse you of nothing ah that s lucky charlotte had brought this out with the richness almost of gaiety and maggie to go on had to think with her own intensity of amerigo to think how he on his side had had to go through with his lie to her how it was for his wife he had done so and how his doing so had given her the clue and set her the example he must have had his own difficulty about it and she was not after all falling below him it was in fact as if thanks to her hovering image of him confronted with this admirable creature even as she was confronted there glowed upon her from afar yet straight and strong a deep explanatory light which covered the last inch of the ground he had given her something to conform to and she hadn t unintelligently turned on him gone back on him as he would have said by not conforming they were together thus he and she close close together whereas charlotte though rising there radiantly before her was really off in some darkness of space that would steep her in solitude and harass her with care the heart of the princess swelled accordingly even in her abasement she had kept in tune with the right and something certainly something that might be like a rare flower snatched from an impossible ledge would and possibly soon come of it for her the right the right yes it took this extraordinary form of her humbugging as she had called it to the end it was only a question of not by a hair s breadth deflecting into the truth so supremely was she braced you must take it from me that your anxiety rests quite on a misconception you must take it from me that i ve never at any moment fancied i could suffer by you and marvellously she kept it up not only kept it up but improved on it you must take it from me that i ve never thought of you but as beautiful wonderful and good which is all i think that you can possibly ask charlotte held her a moment longer she needed not then to have appeared only tactless the last word it s much more my dear than i dreamed of asking i only wanted your denial well then you have it upon your honour upon my honour and she made a point even our young woman of not turning away her grip of her shawl had loosened she had let it fall behind her but she stood there for anything more and till the weight should be lifted with which she saw soon enough what more was to come she saw it in charlotte s face and felt it make between them in the air a chill that completed the coldness of their conscious perjury will you kiss me on it then she couldn t say yes but she didn t say no what availed her still however was to measure in her passivity how much too far charlotte had come to retreat but there was something different also something for which while her cheek received the prodigious kiss she had her opportunity the sight of the others who having risen from their cards to join the absent members of their party had reached the open door at the end of the room and stopped short evidently in presence of the demonstration that awaited them her husband and her father were in front and charlotte s embrace of her which wasn t to be distinguished for them either she felt from her embrace of charlotte took on with their arrival a high publicity xxxvii her father had asked her three days later in an interval of calm how she was affected in the light of their reappearance and of their now perhaps richer fruition by dotty and kitty and by the once formidable mrs rance and the consequence of this inquiry had been for the pair just such another stroll together away from the rest of the party and off into the park as had asserted its need to them on the occasion of the previous visit of these anciently more agitating friends that of their long talk on a sequestered bench beneath one of the great trees when the particular question had come up for them the then purblind discussion of which at their enjoyed leisure maggie had formed the habit of regarding as the first beginning of their present situation the whirligig of time had thus brought round for them again on their finding themselves face to face while the others were gathering for tea on the terrace the same odd impulse quietly to slope so adam verver himself as they went familiarly expressed it that had acted in its way of old acted for the distant autumn afternoon and for the sharpness of their since so outlived crisis it might have been funny to them now that the presence of mrs rance and the lutches and with symptoms too at that time less developed had once for their anxiety and their prudence constituted a crisis it might have been funny that these ladies could ever have figured to their imagination as a symbol of dangers vivid enough to precipitate the need of a remedy this amount of entertainment and assistance they were indeed disposed to extract from their actual impressions they had been finding it for months past by maggie s view a resource and a relief to talk with an approach to intensity when they met of all the people they weren t really thinking of and didn t really care about the people with whom their existence had begun almost to swarm and they closed in at present round the spectres of their past as they permitted themselves to describe the three ladies with a better imitation of enjoying their theme than they had been able to achieve certainly during the stay for instance of the castledeans the castledeans were a new joke comparatively and they had had always to maggie s view to teach themselves the way of it whereas the detroit the providence party rebounding so from providence from detroit was an old and ample one of which the most could be made and as to which a humorous insistence could be guarded sharp and sudden moreover this afternoon had been their well nigh confessed desire just to rest together a little as from some strain long felt but never named to rest as who should say shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand each pair of eyes so yearningly and indeed what could it be but so wearily closed as to render the collapse safe from detection by the other pair it was positively as if in short the inward felicity of their being once more perhaps only for half an hour simply daughter and father had glimmered out for them and they had picked up the pretext that would make it easiest they were husband and wife oh so immensely as regards other persons but after they had dropped again on their old bench conscious that the party on the terrace augmented as in the past by neighbours would do beautifully without them it was wonderfully like their having got together into some boat and paddled off from the shore where husbands and wives luxuriant complications made the air too tropical in the boat they were father and daughter and poor dotty and kitty supplied abundantly for their situation the oars or the sail why into the bargain for that matter this came to maggie couldn t they always live so far as they lived together in a boat she felt in her face with the question the breath of a possibility that soothed her they needed only know each other henceforth in the unmarried relation that other sweet evening in the same place he had been as unmarried as possible which had kept down so to speak the quantity of change in their state well then that other sweet evening was what the present sweet evening would resemble with the quite calculable effect of an exquisite inward refreshment they had after all whatever happened always and ever each other each other that was the hidden treasure and the saving truth to do exactly what they would with a provision full of possibilities who could tell as yet what thanks to it they wouldn t have done before the end they had meanwhile been tracing together in the golden air that toward six o clock of a july afternoon hung about the massed kentish woods several features of the social evolution of her old playmates still beckoned on it would seem by unattainable ideals still falling back beyond the sea to their native seats for renewals of the moral financial conversational one scarce knew what to call it outfit and again and for ever reappearing like a tribe of wandering jewesses our couple had finally exhausted however the study of these annals and maggie was to take up after a drop a different matter or one at least with which the immediate connection was not at first apparent were you amused at me just now when i wondered what other people could wish to struggle for did you think me she asked with some earnestness well fatuous fatuous he seemed at a loss i mean sublime in our happiness as if looking down from a height or rather sublime in our general position that s what i mean she spoke as from the habit of her anxious conscience something that disposed her frequently to assure herself for her human commerce of the state of the books of the spirit because i don t at all want she explained to be blinded or made sniffy by any sense of a social situation her father listened to this declaration as if the precautions of her general mercy could still as they betrayed themselves have surprises for him to say nothing of a charm of delicacy and beauty he might have been wishing to see how far she could go and where she would all touchingly to him arrive but she waited a little as if made nervous precisely by feeling him depend too much on what she said they were avoiding the serious standing off anxiously from the real and they fell again and again as if to disguise their precaution itself into the tone of the time that came back to them from their other talk when they had shared together this same refuge don t you remember she went on how when they were here before i broke it to you that i wasn t so very sure we ourselves had the thing itself he did his best to do so had you mean a social situation yes after fanny assingham had first broken it to me that at the rate we were going we should never have one which was what put us on charlotte oh yes they had had it over quite often enough for him easily to remember maggie had another pause taking it from him that he now could both affirm and admit without wincing that they had been at their critical moment put on charlotte it was as if this recognition had been threshed out between them as fundamental to the honest view of their success well she continued i recall how i felt about kitty and dotty that even if we had already then been more placed or whatever you may call what we are now it still wouldn t have been an excuse for wondering why others couldn t obligingly leave me more exalted by having themselves smaller ideas for those she said were the feelings we used to have oh yes he responded philosophically i remember the feelings we used to have maggie appeared to wish to plead for them a little in tender retrospect as if they had been also respectable it was bad enough i thought to have no sympathy in your heart when you had a position but it was worse to be sublime about it as i was so afraid as i m in fact still afraid of being when it wasn t even there to support one and she put forth again the earnestness she might have been taking herself as having outlived became for it which was doubtless too often even now her danger almost sententious one must always whether or no have some imagination of the states of others of what they may feel deprived of however she added kitty and dotty couldn t imagine we were deprived of anything and now and now but she stopped as for indulgence to their wonder and envy and now they see still more that we can have got everything and kept everything and yet not be proud no we re not proud she answered after a moment i m not sure that we re quite proud enough yet she changed the next instant that subject too she could only do so however by harking back as if it had been a fascination she might have been wishing under this renewed this still more suggestive visitation to keep him with her for remounting the stream of time and dipping again for the softness of the water into the contracted basin of the past we talked about it we talked about it you don t remember so well as i you too didn t know and it was beautiful of you like kitty and dotty you too thought we had a position and were surprised when i thought we ought to have told them we weren t doing for them what they supposed in fact maggie pursued we re not doing it now we re not you see really introducing them i mean not to the people they want then what do you call the people with whom they re now having tea it made her quite spring round that s just what you asked me the other time one of the days there was somebody and i told you i didn t call anybody anything i remember that such people the people we made so welcome didn t count that fanny assingham knew they didn t she had awakened his daughter the echo and on the bench there as before he nodded his head amusedly he kept nervously shaking his foot yes they were only good enough the people who came for us i remember he said again that was the way it all happened that was the way that was the way and you asked me maggie added if i didn t think we ought to tell them tell mrs rance in particular i mean that we had been entertaining her up to then under false pretences precisely but you said she wouldn t have understood to which you replied that in that case you were like her you didn t understand no no but i remember how about our having in our benighted innocence no position you quite crushed me with your explanation well then said maggie with every appearance of delight i ll crush you again i told you that you by yourself had one there was no doubt of that you were different from me you had the same one you always had and then i asked you her father concurred why in that case you hadn t the same then indeed you did he had brought her face round to him before and this held it covering him with its kindled brightness the result of the attested truth of their being able thus in talk to live again together what i replied was that i had lost my position by my marriage that one i know how i saw it would never come back i had done something to it i didn t quite know what given it away somehow and yet not as then appeared really got my return i had been assured always by dear fanny that i could get it only i must wake up so i was trying you see to wake up trying very hard yes and to a certain extent you succeeded as also in waking me but you made much he said of your difficulty to which he added it s the only case i remember mag of you ever making anything of a difficulty she kept her eyes on him a moment that i was so happy as i was that you were so happy as you were well you admitted maggie kept it up that that was a good difficulty you confessed that our life did seem to be beautiful he thought a moment yes i may very well have confessed it for so it did seem to me but he guarded himself with his dim his easier smile what do you want to put on me now only that we used to wonder that we were wondering then if our life wasn t perhaps a little selfish this also for a time much at his leisure adam verver retrospectively fixed because fanny assingham thought so oh no she never thought she couldn t think if she would anything of that sort she only thinks people are sometimes fools maggie developed she doesn t seem to think so much about their being wrong wrong that is in the sense of being wicked she doesn t the princess further adventured quite so much mind their being wicked i see i see and yet it might have been for his daughter that he didn t so very vividly see then she only thought us fools oh no i don t say that i m speaking of our being selfish and that comes under the head of the wickedness fanny condones oh i don t say she condones a scruple in maggie raised its crest besides i m speaking of what was her father showed however after a little that he had not been reached by this discrimination his thoughts were resting for the moment where they had settled look here mag he said reflectively i ain t selfish i ll be blowed if i m selfish well maggie if he would talk of that could also pronounce then father i am oh shucks said adam verver to whom the vernacular in moments of deepest sincerity could thus come back i ll believe it he presently added when amerigo complains of you ah it s just he who s my selfishness i m selfish so to speak for him i mean she continued that he s my motive in everything well her father could from experience fancy what she meant but hasn t a girl a right to be selfish about her husband what i don t mean she observed without answering is that i m jealous of him but that s his merit it s not mine her father again seemed amused at her you could be otherwise oh how can i talk she asked of otherwise it isn t luckily for me otherwise if everything were different she further presented her thought of course everything would be and then again as if that were but half my idea is this that when you only love a little you re naturally not jealous or are only jealous also a little so that it doesn t matter but when you love in a deeper and intenser way then you are in the same proportion jealous your jealousy has intensity and no doubt ferocity when however you love in the most abysmal and unutterable way of all why then you re beyond everything and nothing can pull you down mr verver listened as if he had nothing on these high lines to oppose and that s the way you love for a minute she failed to speak but at last she answered it wasn t to talk about that i do feel however beyond everything and as a consequence of that i dare say she added with a turn to gaiety seem often not to know quite where i am the mere fine pulse of passion in it the suggestion as of a creature consciously floating and shining in a warm summer sea some element of dazzling sapphire and silver a creature cradled upon depths buoyant among dangers in which fear or folly or sinking otherwise than in play was impossible something of all this might have been making once more present to him with his discreet his half shy assent to it her probable enjoyment of a rapture that he in his day had presumably convinced no great number of persons either of his giving or of his receiving he sat awhile as if he knew himself hushed almost admonished and not for the first time yet it was an effect that might have brought before him rather what she had gained than what he had missed besides who but himself really knew what he after all hadn t or even had gained the beauty of her condition was keeping him at any rate as he might feel in sight of the sea where though his personal dips were over the whole thing could shine at him and the air and the plash and the play become for him too a sensation that couldn t be fixed upon him as missing since if it wasn t personally floating if it wasn t even sitting in the sand it could yet pass very well for breathing the bliss in a communicated irresistible way for tasting the balm it could pass further for knowing for knowing that without him nothing might have been which would have been missing least of all i guess i ve never been jealous he finally remarked and it said more to her he had occasion next to perceive than he was intending for it made her as by the pressure of a spring give him a look that seemed to tell of things she couldn t speak but she at last tried for one of them oh it s you father who are what i call beyond everything nothing can pull you down he returned the look as with the sociability of their easy communion though inevitably throwing in this time a shade of solemnity he might have been seeing things to say and others whether of a type presumptuous or not doubtless better kept back so he settled on the merely obvious well then we make a pair we re all right oh we re all right a declaration launched not only with all her discriminating emphasis but confirmed by her rising with decision and standing there as if the object of their small excursion required accordingly no further pursuit at this juncture however with the act of their crossing the bar to get as might be into port there occurred the only approach to a betrayal of their having had to beat against the wind her father kept his place and it was as if she had got over first and were pausing for her consort to follow if they were all right they were all right yet he seemed to hesitate and wait for some word beyond his eyes met her own suggestively and it was only after she had contented herself with simply smiling at him smiling ever so fixedly that he spoke for the remaining importance of it from the bench where he leaned back raising his face to her his legs thrust out a trifle wearily and his hands grasping either side of the seat they had beaten against the wind and she was still fresh they had beaten against the wind and he as at the best the more battered vessel perhaps just vaguely drooped but the effect of their silence was that she appeared to beckon him on and he might have been fairly alongside of her when at the end of another minute he found their word the only thing is that as for ever putting up again with your pretending that you re selfish at this she helped him out with it you won t take it from me i won t take it from you well of course you won t for that s your way it doesn t matter and it only proves but it doesn t matter either what it proves i m at this very moment she declared frozen stiff with selfishness he faced her awhile longer in the same way it was strangely as if by this sudden arrest by their having in their acceptance of the unsaid or at least their reference to it practically given up pretending it was as if they were in for it for something they had been ineffably avoiding but the dread of which was itself in a manner a seduction just as any confession of the dread was by so much an allusion then she seemed to see him let himself go when a person s of the nature you speak of there are always other persons to suffer but you ve just been describing to me what you d take if you had once a good chance from your husband oh i m not talking about my husband then whom are you talking about both the retort and the rejoinder had come quicker than anything previously exchanged and they were followed on maggie s part by a momentary drop but she was not to fall away and while her companion kept his eyes on her while she wondered if he weren t expecting her to name his wife then with high hypocrisy as paying for his daughter s bliss she produced something that she felt to be much better i m talking about you do you mean i ve been your victim of course you ve been my victim what have you done ever done that hasn t been for me many things more than i can tell you things you ve only to think of for yourself what do you make of all that i ve done for myself yourself she brightened out with derision what do you make of what i ve done for american city it took her but a moment to say i m not talking of you as a public character i m talking of you on your personal side well american city if personalities can do it has given me a pretty personal side what do you make he went on of what i ve done for my reputation your reputation there you ve given it up to them the awful people for less than nothing you ve given it up to them to tear to pieces to make their horrible vulgar jokes against you with ah my dear i don t care for their horrible vulgar jokes adam verver almost artlessly urged then there exactly you are she triumphed everything that touches you everything that surrounds you goes on by your splendid indifference and your incredible permission at your expense just as he had been sitting he looked at her an instant longer then he slowly rose while his hands stole into his pockets and stood there before her of course my dear you go on at my expense it has never been my idea he smiled that you should work for your living i wouldn t have liked to see it with which for a little again they remained face to face say therefore i have had the feelings of a father how have they made me a victim because i sacrifice you but to what in the world at this it hung before her that she should have had as never yet her opportunity to say and it held her for a minute as in a vise her impression of his now with his strained smile which touched her to deepest depths sounding her in his secret unrest this was the moment in the whole process of their mutual vigilance in which it decidedly most hung by a hair that their thin wall might be pierced by the lightest wrong touch it shook between them this transparency with their very breath it was an exquisite tissue but stretched on a frame and would give way the next instant if either so much as breathed too hard she held her breath for she knew by his eyes the light at the heart of which he couldn t blind that he was by his intention making sure sure whether or no her certainty was like his the intensity of his dependence on it at that moment this itself was what absolutely convinced her so that as if perched up before him on her vertiginous point and in the very glare of his observation she balanced for thirty seconds she almost rocked she might have been for the time in all her conscious person the very form of the equilibrium they were in their different ways equally trying to save and they were saving it yes they were or at least she was that was still the workable issue she could say as she felt her dizziness drop she held herself hard the thing was to be done once for all by her acting now where she stood so much was crowded into so short a space that she knew already she was keeping her head she had kept it by the warning of his eyes she shouldn t lose it again she knew how and why and if she had turned cold this was precisely what helped her he had said to himself she ll break down and name amerigo she ll say it s to him she s sacrificing me and its by what that will give me with so many other things too that my suspicion will be clinched he was watching her lips spying for the symptoms of the sound whereby these symptoms had only to fail and he would have got nothing that she didn t measure out to him as she gave it she had presently in fact so recovered herself that she seemed to know she could more easily have made him name his wife than he have made her name her husband it was there before her that if she should so much as force him just not consciously to avoid saying charlotte charlotte he would have given himself away but to be sure of this was enough for her and she saw more clearly with each lapsing instant what they were both doing he was doing what he had steadily been coming to he was practically offering himself pressing himself upon her as a sacrifice he had read his way so into her best possibility and where had she already for weeks and days past planted her feet if not on her acceptance of the offer cold indeed colder and colder she turned as she felt herself suffer this close personal vision of his attitude still not to make her weaken that was her very certitude the intensity of his pressure for if something dreadful hadn t happened there wouldn t for either of them be these dreadful things to do she had meanwhile as well the immense advantage that she could have named charlotte without exposing herself as for that matter she was the next minute showing him why i sacrifice you simply to everything and to every one i take the consequences of your marriage as perfectly natural he threw back his head a little settling with one hand his eyeglass what do you call my dear the consequences your life as your marriage has made it well hasn t it made it exactly what we wanted she just hesitated then felt herself steady oh beyond what she had dreamed exactly what i wanted yes his eyes through his straightened glasses were still on hers and he might with his intenser fixed smile have been knowing she was for herself rightly inspired what do you make then of what i wanted i don t make anything any more than of what you ve got that s exactly the point i don t put myself out to do so i never have i take from you all i can get all you ve provided for me and i leave you to make of your own side of the matter what you can there you are the rest is your own affair i don t even pretend to concern myself to concern yourself he watched her as she faintly faltered looking about her now so as not to keep always meeting his face with what may have really become of you it s as if we had agreed from the first not to go into that such an arrangement being of course charming for me you can t say you know that i haven t stuck to it he didn t say so then even with the opportunity given him of her stopping once more to catch her breath he said instead oh my dear oh oh but it made no difference know as she might what a past still so recent and yet so distant it alluded to she repeated her denial warning him off on her side from spoiling the truth of her contention i never went into anything and you see i don t i ve continued to adore you but what s that from a decent daughter to such a father what but a question of convenient arrangement our having two houses three houses instead of one you would have arranged for fifty if i had wished and my making it easy for you to see the child you don t claim i suppose that my natural course once you had set up for yourself would have been to ship you back to american city these were direct inquiries they quite rang out in the soft wooded air so that adam verver for a minute appeared to meet them with reflection she saw reflection however quickly enough show him what to do with them do you know mag what you make me wish when you talk that way and he waited again while she further got from him the sense of something that had been behind deeply in the shade coming cautiously to the front and just feeling its way before presenting itself you regularly make me wish that i had shipped back to american city when you go on as you do but he really had to hold himself to say it well when i go on why you make me quite want to ship back myself you make me quite feel as if american city would be the best place for us it made her all too finely vibrate for us for me and charlotte do you know that if we should ship it would serve you quite right with which he smiled oh he smiled and if you say much more we will ship ah then it was that the cup of her conviction full to the brim overflowed at a touch there was his idea the clearness of which for an instant almost dazzled her it was a blur of light in the midst of which she saw charlotte like some object marked by contrast in blackness saw her waver in the field of vision saw her removed transported doomed and he had named charlotte named her again and she had made him which was all she had needed more it was as if she had held a blank letter to the fire and the writing had come out still larger than she hoped the recognition of it took her some seconds but she might when she spoke have been folding up these precious lines and restoring them to her pocket well i shall be as much as ever then the cause of what you do i haven t the least doubt of your being up to that if you should think i might get anything out of it even the little pleasure she laughed of having said as you call it more let my enjoyment of this therefore at any price continue to represent for you what i call sacrificing you she had drawn a long breath she had made him do it all for her and had lighted the way to it without his naming her husband that silence had been as distinct as the sharp the inevitable sound and something now in him followed it up a sudden air as of confessing at last fully to where she was and of begging the particular question don t you think then i can take care of myself ah it s exactly what i ve gone upon if it wasn t for that but she broke off and they remained only another moment face to face i ll let you know my dear the day i feel you ve begun to sacrifice me begun she extravagantly echoed well it will be for me the day you ve ceased to believe in me with which his glasses still fixed on her his hands in his pockets his hat pushed back his legs a little apart he seemed to plant or to square himself for a kind of assurance it had occurred to him he might as well treat her to in default of other things before they changed their subject it had the effect for her of a reminder a reminder of all he was of all he had done of all above and beyond his being her perfect little father she might take him as representing take him as having quite eminently in the eyes of two hemispheres been capable of and as therefore wishing not was it illegitimately to call her attention to the successful beneficent person the beautiful bountiful original dauntlessly wilful great citizen the consummate collector and infallible high authority he had been and still was these things struck her on the spot as making up for him in a wonderful way a character she must take into account in dealing with him either for pity or for envy he positively under the impression seemed to loom larger than life for her so that she saw him during these moments in a light of recognition which had had its brightness for her at many an hour of the past but which had never been so intense and so almost admonitory his very quietness was part of it now as always part of everything of his success his originality his modesty his exquisite public perversity his inscrutable incalculable energy and this quality perhaps it might be all the more too as the result for the present occasion of an admirable traceable effort that placed him in her eyes as no precious a work of art probably had ever been placed in his own there was a long moment absolutely during which her impression rose and rose even as that of the typical charmed gazer in the still museum before the named and dated object the pride of the catalogue that time has polished and consecrated extraordinary in particular was the number of the different ways in which he thus affected her as showing he was strong that was the great thing he was sure sure for himself always whatever his idea the expression of that in him had somehow never appeared more identical with his proved taste for the rare and the true but what stood out beyond everything was that he was always marvellously young which couldn t but crown at this juncture his whole appeal to her imagination before she knew it she was lifted aloft by the consciousness that he was simply a great and deep and high little man and that to love him with tenderness was not to be distinguished a whit from loving him with pride it came to her all strangely as a sudden an immense relief the sense that he wasn t a failure and could never be purged their predicament of every meanness made it as if they had really emerged in their transmuted union to smile almost without pain it was like a new confidence and after another instant she knew even still better why wasn t it because now also on his side he was thinking of her as his daughter was trying her during these mute seconds as the child of his blood oh then if she wasn t with her little conscious passion the child of any weakness what was she but strong enough too it swelled in her fairly it raised her higher higher she wasn t in that case a failure either hadn t been but the contrary his strength was her strength her pride was his and they were decent and competent together this was all in the answer she finally made him i believe in you more than any one than any one at all she hesitated for all it might mean but there was oh a thousand times no doubt of it than any one at all she kept nothing of it back now met his eyes over it let him have the whole of it after which she went on and that s the way i think you believe in me he looked at her a minute longer but his tone at last was right about the way yes well then she spoke as for the end and for other matters for anything everything else there might be they would never return to it well then his hands came out and while her own took them he drew her to his breast and held her he held her hard and kept her long and she let herself go but it was an embrace that august and almost stern produced for all its intimacy no revulsion and broke into no inconsequence of tears xxxviii maggie was to feel after this passage how they had both been helped through it by the influence of that accident of her having been caught a few nights before in the familiar embrace of her father s wife his return to the saloon had chanced to coincide exactly with this demonstration missed moreover neither by her husband nor by the assinghams who their card party suspended had quitted the billiard room with him she had been conscious enough at the time of what such an impression received by the others might in that extended state do for her case and none the less that as no one had appeared to wish to be the first to make a remark about it it had taken on perceptibly the special shade of consecration conferred by unanimities of silence the effect she might have considered had been almost awkward the promptitude of her separation from charlotte as if they had been discovered in some absurdity on her becoming aware of spectators the spectators on the other hand that was the appearance mightn t have supposed them in the existing relation addicted to mutual endearments and yet hesitating with a fine scruple between sympathy and hilarity must have felt that almost any spoken or laughed comment could be kept from sounding vulgar only by sounding beyond any permitted measure intelligent they had evidently looked the two young wives like a pair of women making up effusively as women were supposed to do especially when approved fools after a broil but taking note of the reconciliation would imply on her father s part on amerigo s and on fanny assingham s some proportionate vision of the grounds of their difference there had been something there had been but too much in the incident for each observer yet there was nothing any one could have said without seeming essentially to say see see the dear things their quarrel s blissfully over our quarrel what quarrel the dear things themselves would necessarily in that case have demanded and the wits of the others would thus have been called upon for some agility of exercise no one had been equal to the flight of producing off hand a fictive reason for any estrangement to take that is the place of the true which had so long for the finer sensibility pervaded the air and every one accordingly not to be inconveniently challenged was pretending immediately after to have remarked nothing that any one else hadn t maggie s own measure had remained all the same full of the reflection caught from the total inference which had acted virtually by enabling every one present and oh charlotte not least to draw a long breath the message of the little scene had been different for each but it had been this markedly all round that it reinforced reinforced even immensely the general effort carried on from week to week and of late distinctly more successful to look and talk and move as if nothing in life were the matter supremely however while this glass was held up to her had maggie s sense turned to the quality of the success constituted on the spot for charlotte most of all if she was guessing how her father must have secretly started how her husband must have secretly wondered how fanny assingham must have secretly in a flash seen daylight for herself most of all had she tasted by communication of the high profit involved for her companion she felt in all her pulses charlotte feel it and how publicity had been required absolutely to crown her own abasement it was the added touch and now nothing was wanting which to do her stepmother justice mrs verver had appeared but to desire from that evening to show with the last vividness that she recognised maggie lived over again the minutes in question had found herself repeatedly doing so to the degree that the whole evening hung together to her aftersense as a thing appointed by some occult power that had dealt with her that had for instance animated the four with just the right restlessness too had decreed and directed and exactly timed it in them making their game of bridge however abysmal a face it had worn for her give way precisely to their common unavowed impulse to find out to emulate charlotte s impatience a preoccupation this latter attached detectedly to the member of the party who was roaming in her queerness and was for all their simulated blindness not roaming unnoted if mrs verver meanwhile then had struck her as determined in a certain direction by the last felicity into which that night had flowered our young woman was yet not to fail of appreciating the truth that she had not been put at ease after all with absolute permanence maggie had seen her unmistakably desire to rise to the occasion and be magnificent seen her decide that the right way for this would be to prove that the reassurance she had extorted there under the high cool lustre of the saloon a twinkle of crystal and silver had not only poured oil upon the troubled waters of their question but had fairly drenched their whole intercourse with that lubricant she had exceeded the limit of discretion in this insistence on her capacity to repay in proportion a service she acknowledged as handsome why handsome maggie would have been free to ask since if she had been veracious the service assuredly would not have been huge it would in that case have come up vividly and for each of them alike that the truth on the princess s lips presented no difficulty if the latter s mood in fact could have turned itself at all to private gaiety it might have failed to resist the diversion of seeing so clever a creature so beguiled charlotte s theory of a generous manner was manifestly to express that her stepdaughter s word wiping out as she might have said everything had restored them to the serenity of a relation without a cloud it had been in short in this light ideally conclusive so that no ghost of anything it referred to could ever walk again what was the ecstasy of that however but in itself a trifle compromising as truly within the week maggie had occasion to suspect her friend of beginning and rather abruptly to remember convinced as she was of the example already given her by her husband and in relation to which her profession of trust in his mistress had been an act of conformity exquisitely calculated her imagination yet sought in the hidden play of his influence the explanation of any change of surface any difference of expression or intention there had been through life as we know few quarters in which the princess s fancy could let itself loose but it shook off restraint when it plunged into the figured void of the detail of that relation this was a realm it could people with images again and again with fresh ones they swarmed there like the strange combinations that lurked in the woods at twilight they loomed into the definite and faded into the vague their main present sign for her being however that they were always that they were duskily agitated her earlier vision of a state of bliss made insecure by the very intensity of the bliss this had dropped from her she had ceased to see as she lost herself the pair of operatic of high wagnerian lovers she found deep within her these comparisons interlocked in their wood of enchantment a green glade as romantic as one s dream of an old german forest the picture was veiled on the contrary with the dimness of trouble behind which she felt indistinguishable the procession of forms that had lost all so pitifully their precious confidence therefore though there was in these days for her with amerigo little enough even of the imitation from day to day of unembarrassed references as she had foreseen for that matter from the first that there would be her active conception of his accessibility to their companion s own private and unextinguished right to break ground was not much less active than before so it was that her inner sense in spite of everything represented him as still pulling wires and controlling currents or rather indeed as muffling the whole possibility keeping it down and down leading his accomplice continually on to some new turn of the road as regards herself maggie had become more conscious from week to week of his ingenuities of intention to make up to her for their forfeiture in so dire a degree of any reality of frankness a privation that had left on his lips perhaps a little of the same thirst with which she fairly felt her own distorted the torment of the lost pilgrim who listens in desert sands for the possible the impossible plash of water it was just this hampered state in him none the less that she kept before her when she wished most to find grounds of dignity for the hard little passion which nothing he had done could smother there were hours enough lonely hours in which she let dignity go then there were others when clinging with her winged concentration to some deep cell of her heart she stored away her hived tenderness as if she had gathered it all from flowers he was walking ostensibly beside her but in fact given over without a break to the grey medium in which he helplessly groped a perception on her part which was a perpetual pang and which might last what it would for ever if need be but which if relieved at all must be relieved by his act alone she herself could do nothing more for it she had done the utmost possible it was meantime not the easier to bear for this aspect under which charlotte was presented as depending on him for guidance taking it from him even in doses of bitterness and yet lost with him in devious depths nothing was thus more sharply to be inferred than that he had promptly enough warned her on hearing from her of the precious assurance received from his wife that she must take care her satisfaction didn t betray something of her danger maggie had a day of still waiting after allowing him time to learn how unreservedly she had lied for him of waiting as for the light of she scarce knew what slow shining reflection of this knowledge in his personal attitude what retarded evolution she asked herself in these hours mightn t poor charlotte all unwittingly have precipitated she was thus poor charlotte again for maggie even while maggie s own head was bowed and the reason for this kept coming back to our young woman in the conception of what would secretly have passed she saw her face to face with the prince take from him the chill of his stiffest admonition with the possibilities of deeper difficulty that it represented for each she heard her ask irritated and sombre what tone in god s name since her bravery didn t suit him she was then to adopt and by way of a fantastic flight of divination she heard amerigo reply in a voice of which every fine note familiar and admirable came home to her that one must really manage such prudences a little for one s self it was positive in the princess that for this she breathed charlotte s cold air turned away from him in it with her turned with her in growing compassion this way and that hovered behind her while she felt her ask herself where then she should rest marvellous the manner in which under such imaginations maggie thus circled and lingered quite as if she were materially following her unseen counting every step she helplessly wasted noting every hindrance that brought her to a pause a few days of this accordingly had wrought a change in that apprehension of the instant beatitude of triumph of triumph magnanimous and serene with which the upshot of the night scene on the terrace had condemned our young woman to make terms she had had as we know her vision of the gilt bars bent of the door of the cage forced open from within and the creature imprisoned roaming at large a movement on the creature s part that was to have even for the short interval its impressive beauty but of which the limit and in yet another direction had loomed straight into view during her last talk under the great trees with her father it was when she saw his wife s face ruefully attached to the quarter to which in the course of their session he had so significantly addressed his own it was then that maggie could watch for its turning pale it was then she seemed to know what she had meant by thinking of her in she shadow of his most ominous reference as doomed if as i say her attention now day after day so circled and hovered it found itself arrested for certain passages during which she absolutely looked with charlotte s grave eyes what she unfailingly made out through them was the figure of a little quiet gentleman who mostly wore as he moved alone across the field of vision a straw hat a white waistcoat and a blue necktie keeping a cigar in his teeth and his hands in his pockets and who oftener than not presented a somewhat meditative back while he slowly measured the perspectives of the park and broodingly counted it might have appeared his steps there were hours of intensity for a week or two when it was for all the world as if she had guardedly tracked her stepmother in the great house from room to room and from window to window only to see her here and there and everywhere try her uneasy outlook question her issue and her fate something unmistakably had come up for her that had never come up before it represented a new complication and had begotten a new anxiety things these that she carried about with her done up in the napkin of her lover s accepted rebuke while she vainly hunted for some corner where she might put them safely down the disguised solemnity the prolonged futility of her search might have been grotesque to a more ironic eye but maggie s provision of irony which we have taken for naturally small had never been so scant as now and there were moments while she watched with her thus unseen when the mere effect of being near her was to feel her own heart in her throat was to be almost moved to saying to her hold on tight my poor dear without too much terror and it will all come out somehow even to that indeed she could reflect charlotte might have replied that it was easy to say even to that no great meaning could attach so long as the little meditative man in the straw hat kept coming into view with his indescribable air of weaving his spell weaving it off there by himself in whatever quarter of the horizon the appearances were scanned he was to be noticed as absorbed in this occupation and maggie was to become aware of two or three extraordinary occasions of receiving from him the hint that he measured the impression he produced it was not really till after their recent long talk in the park that she knew how deeply how quite exhaustively they had then communicated so that they were to remain together for the time in consequence quite in the form of a couple of sociable drinkers who sit back from the table over which they have been resting their elbows over which they have emptied to the last drop their respective charged cups the cups were still there on the table but turned upside down and nothing was left for the companions but to confirm by placid silences the fact that the wine had been good they had parted positively as if on either side primed with it primed for whatever was to be and everything between them as the month waned added its touch of truth to this similitude nothing truly was at present between them save that they were looking at each other in infinite trust it fairly wanted no more words and when they met during the deep summer days met even without witnesses when they kissed at morning and evening or on any of the other occasions of contact that they had always so freely celebrated a pair of birds of the upper air could scarce have appeared less to invite each other to sit down and worry afresh so it was that in the house itself where more of his waiting treasures than ever were provisionally ranged she sometimes only looked at him from end to end of the great gallery the pride of the house for instance as if in one of the halls of a museum she had been an earnest young woman with a baedeker and he a vague gentleman to whom even baedekers were unknown he had ever of course had his way of walking about to review his possessions and verify their condition but this was a pastime to which he now struck her as almost extravagantly addicted and when she passed near him and he turned to give her a smile she caught or so she fancied the greater depth of his small perpetual hum of contemplation it was as if he were singing to himself sotto voce as he went and it was also on occasion quite ineffably as if charlotte hovering watching listening on her side too kept sufficiently within earshot to make it out as song and yet for some reason connected with the very manner of it stood off and didn t dare one of the attentions she had from immediately after her marriage most freely paid him was that of her interest in his rarities her appreciation of his taste her native passion for beautiful objects and her grateful desire not to miss anything he could teach her about them maggie had in due course seen her begin to work this fortunately natural source of sympathy for all it was worth she took possession of the mound throughout its extent she abounded to odd excess one might have remarked in the assumption of its being for her with her husband all the ground the finest clearest air and most breathable medium common to them it had been given to maggie to wonder if she didn t in these intensities of approbation too much shut him up to his province but this was a complaint he had never made his daughter and charlotte must at least have had for her that thanks to her admirable instinct her range of perception marching with his own and never falling behind she had probably not so much as once treated him to a rasping mistake or a revealing stupidity maggie wonderfully in the summer days felt it forced upon her that that was one way after all of being a genial wife and it was never so much forced upon her as at these odd moments of her encountering the sposi as amerigo called them under the coved ceilings of fawns while so together yet at the same time so separate they were making their daily round charlotte hung behind with emphasised attention she stopped when her husband stopped but at the distance of a case or two or of whatever other succession of objects and the likeness of their connection would not have been wrongly figured if he had been thought of as holding in one of his pocketed hands the end of a long silken halter looped round her beautiful neck he didn t twitch it yet it was there he didn t drag her but she came and those indications that i have described the princess as finding extraordinary in him were two or three mute facial intimations which his wife s presence didn t prevent his addressing his daughter nor prevent his daughter as she passed it was doubtless to be added from flushing a little at the receipt of they amounted perhaps only to a wordless wordless smile but the smile was the soft shake of the twisted silken rope and maggie s translation of it held in her breast till she got well away came out only as if it might have been overheard when some door was closed behind her yes you see i lead her now by the neck i lead her to her doom and she doesn t so much as know what it is though she has a fear in her heart which if you had the chances to apply your ear there that i as a husband have you would hear thump and thump and thump she thinks it may be her doom the awful place over there awful for her but she s afraid to ask don t you see just as she s afraid of not asking just as she s afraid of so many other things that she sees multiplied round her now as portents and betrayals she ll know however when she does know charlotte s one opportunity meanwhile for the air of confidence she had formerly worn so well and that agreed so with her firm and charming type was the presence of visitors never as the season advanced wholly intermitted rather in fact so constant with all the people who turned up for luncheon and for tea and to see the house now replete now famous that maggie grew to think again of this large element of company as of a kind of renewed water supply for the tank in which like a party of panting gold fish they kept afloat it helped them unmistakably with each other weakening the emphasis of so many of the silences of which their intimate intercourse would otherwise have consisted beautiful and wonderful for her even at times was the effect of these interventions their effect above all in bringing home to each the possible heroism of perfunctory things they learned fairly to live in the perfunctory they remained in it as many hours of the day as might be it took on finally the likeness of some spacious central chamber in a haunted house a great overarched and overglazed rotunda where gaiety might reign but the doors of which opened into sinister circular passages here they turned up for each other as they said with the blank faces that denied any uneasiness felt in the approach here they closed numerous doors carefully behind them all save the door that connected the place as by a straight tented corridor with the outer world and encouraging thus the irruption of society imitated the aperture through which the bedizened performers of the circus are poured into the ring the great part mrs verver had socially played came luckily maggie could make out to her assistance she had personal friends charlotte s personal friends had ever been in london at the two houses one of the most convenient pleasantries who actually tempered at this crisis her aspect of isolation and it wouldn t have been hard to guess that her best moments were those in which she suffered no fear of becoming a bore to restrain her appeal to their curiosity their curiosity might be vague but their clever hostess was distinct and she marched them about sparing them nothing as if she counted each day on a harvest of half crowns maggie met her again in the gallery at the oddest hours with the party she was entertaining heard her draw out the lesson insist upon the interest snub even the particular presumption and smile for the general bewilderment inevitable features these latter of almost any occasion in a manner that made our young woman herself incurably dazzled marvel afresh at the mystery by which a creature who could be in some connexions so earnestly right could be in others so perversely wrong when her father vaguely circulating was attended by his wife it was always charlotte who seemed to bring up the rear but he hung in the background when she did cicerone and it was then perhaps that moving mildly and modestly to and fro on the skirts of the exhibition his appearance of weaving his spell was for the initiated conscience least to be resisted brilliant women turned to him in vague emotion but his response scarce committed him more than if he had been the person employed to see that after the invading wave was spent the cabinets were all locked and the symmetries all restored there was a morning when during the hour before luncheon and shortly after the arrival of a neighbourly contingent neighbourly from ten miles off whom mrs verver had taken in charge maggie paused on the threshold of the gallery through which she had been about to pass faltered there for the very impression of his face as it met her from an opposite door charlotte half way down the vista held together as if by something almost austere in the grace of her authority the semi scared now that they were there knot of her visitors who since they had announced themselves by telegram as yearning to inquire and admire saw themselves restricted to this consistency her voice high and clear and a little hard reached her husband and her step daughter while she thus placed beyond doubt her cheerful submission to duty her words addressed to the largest publicity rang for some minutes through the place every one as quiet to listen as if it had been a church ablaze with tapers and she were taking her part in some hymn of praise fanny assingham looked rapt in devotion fanny assingham who forsook this other friend as little as she forsook either her host or the princess or the prince or the principino she supported her in slow revolutions in murmurous attestations of presence at all such times and maggie advancing after a first hesitation was not to fail of noting her solemn inscrutable attitude her eyes attentively lifted so that she might escape being provoked to betray an impression she betrayed one however as maggie approached dropping her gaze to the latter s level long enough to seem to adventure marvellously on a mute appeal you understand don t you that if she didn t do this there would be no knowing what she might do this light mrs assingham richly launched while her younger friend unresistingly moved became uncertain again and then not too much to show it or rather positively to conceal it and to conceal something more as well turned short round to one of the windows and awkwardly pointlessly waited the largest of the three pieces has the rare peculiarity that the garlands looped round it which as you see are the finest possible vieux saxe are not of the same origin or period or even wonderful as they are of a taste quite so perfect they have been put on at a later time by a process of which there are very few examples and none so important as this which is really quite unique so that though the whole thing is a little baroque its value as a specimen is i believe almost inestimable so the high voice quavered aiming truly at effects far over the heads of gaping neighbours so the speaker piling it up sticking at nothing as less interested judges might have said seemed to justify the faith with which she was honoured maggie meanwhile at the window knew the strangest thing to be happening she had turned suddenly to crying or was at least on the point of it the lighted square before her all blurred and dim the high voice went on its quaver was doubtless for conscious ears only but there were verily thirty seconds during which it sounded for our young woman like the shriek of a soul in pain kept up a minute longer it would break and collapse so that maggie felt herself the next thing turn with a start to her father can t she be stopped hasn t she done it enough some such question as that she let herself ask him to suppose in her then it was that across half the gallery for he had not moved from where she had first seen him he struck her as confessing with strange tears in his own eyes to sharp identity of emotion poor thing poor thing it reached straight isn t she for one s credit on the swagger after which as held thus together they had still another strained minute the shame the pity the better knowledge the smothered protest the divined anguish even so overcame him that blushing to his eyes he turned short away the affair but of a few muffled moments this snatched communion yet lifted maggie as on air so much for deep guesses on her own side too it gave her to think of there was honestly an awful mixture in things and it was not closed to her aftersense of such passages we have already indeed in other cases seen it open that the deepest depth of all in a perceived penalty was that you couldn t be sure some of your compunctions and contortions wouldn t show for ridiculous amerigo that morning for instance had been as absent as he at this juncture appeared to desire he should mainly be noted as being he had gone to london for the day and the night a necessity that now frequently rose for him and that he had more than once suffered to operate during the presence of guests successions of pretty women the theory of his fond interest in whom had been publicly cultivated it had never occurred to his wife to pronounce him ingenuous but there came at last a high dim august dawn when she couldn t sleep and when creeping restlessly about and breathing at her window the coolness of wooded acres she found the faint flush of the east march with the perception of that other almost equal prodigy it rosily coloured her vision that even such as he was yes her husband could on occasion sin by excess of candour he wouldn t otherwise have given as his reason for going up to portland place in the august days that he was arranging books there he had bought a great many of late and he had had others a large number sent from rome wonders of old print in which her father had been interested but when her imagination tracked him to the dusty town to the house where drawn blinds and pale shrouds where a caretaker and a kitchenmaid were alone in possession it wasn t to see him in his shirtsleeves unpacking battered boxes she saw him in truth less easily beguiled saw him wander in the closed dusky rooms from place to place or else for long periods recline on deep sofas and stare before him through the smoke of ceaseless cigarettes she made him out as liking better than anything in the world just now to be alone with his thoughts being herself connected with his thoughts she continued to believe more than she had ever been it was thereby a good deal as if he were alone with her she made him out as resting so from that constant strain of the perfunctory to which he was exposed at fawns and she was accessible to the impression of the almost beggared aspect of this alternative it was like his doing penance in sordid ways being sent to prison or being kept without money it wouldn t have taken much to make her think of him as really kept without food he might have broken away might easily have started to travel he had a right thought wonderful maggie now to so many more freedoms than he took his secret was of course that at fawns he all the while winced was all the while in presences in respect to which he had thrown himself back with a hard pressure on whatever mysteries of pride whatever inward springs familiar to the man of the world he could keep from snapping maggie for some reason had that morning while she watched the sunrise taken an extraordinary measure of the ground on which he would have had to snatch at pretexts for absence it all came to her there he got off to escape from a sound the sound was in her own ears still that of charlotte s high coerced quaver before the cabinets in the hushed gallery the voice by which she herself had been pierced the day before as by that of a creature in anguish and by which while she sought refuge at the blurred window the tears had been forced into her eyes her comprehension soared so high that the wonder for her became really his not feeling the need of wider intervals and thicker walls before that admiration she also meditated consider as she might now she kept reading not less into what he omitted than into what he performed a beauty of intention that touched her fairly the more by being obscure it was like hanging over a garden in the dark nothing was to be made of the confusion of growing things but one felt they were folded flowers and their vague sweetness made the whole air their medium he had to turn away but he wasn t at least a coward he would wait on the spot for the issue of what he had done on the spot she sank to her knees with her arm on the ledge of her window seat where she blinded her eyes from the full glare of seeing that his idea could only be to wait whatever might come at her side it was to her buried face that she thus for a long time felt him draw nearest though after a while when the strange wail of the gallery began to repeat its inevitable echo she was conscious of how that brought out his pale hard grimace xxxix the resemblance had not been present to her on first coming out into the hot still brightness of the sunday afternoon only the second sunday of all the summer when the party of six the party of seven including the principino had practically been without accessions or invasions but within sight of charlotte seated far away very much where she had expected to find her the princess fell to wondering if her friend wouldn t be affected quite as she herself had been that night on the terrace under mrs verver s perceptive pursuit the relation to day had turned itself round charlotte was seeing her come through patches of lingering noon quite as she had watched charlotte menace her through the starless dark and there was a moment that of her waiting a little as they thus met across the distance when the interval was bridged by a recognition not less soundless and to all appearance not less charged with strange meanings than that of the other occasion the point however was that they had changed places maggie had from her window seen her stepmother leave the house at so unlikely an hour three o clock of a canicular august for a ramble in garden or grove and had thereupon felt her impulse determined with the same sharpness that had made the spring of her companion s three weeks before it was the hottest day of the season and the shaded siesta for people all at their ease would certainly rather have been prescribed but our young woman had perhaps not yet felt it so fully brought home that such refinements of repose among them constituted the empty chair at the feast this was the more distinct as the feast literally in the great bedimmed dining room the cool ceremonious semblance of luncheon had just been taking place without mrs verver she had been represented but by the plea of a bad headache not reported to the rest of the company by her husband but offered directly to mr verver himself on their having assembled by her maid deputed for the effect and solemnly producing it maggie had sat down with the others to viands artfully iced to the slow circulation of precious tinkling jugs to marked reserves of reference in many directions poor fanny assingham herself scarce thrusting her nose out of the padded hollow into which she had withdrawn a consensus of languor which might almost have been taken for a community of dread ruled the scene relieved only by the fitful experiments of father mitchell good holy hungry man a trusted and overworked london friend and adviser who had taken for a week or two the light neighbouring service local rites flourishing under maggie s munificence and was enjoying as a convenience all the bounties of the house he conversed undiscouraged father mitchell conversed mainly with the indefinite wandering smile of the entertainers and the princess s power to feel him on the whole a blessing for these occasions was not impaired by what was awkward in her consciousness of having from the first of her trouble really found her way without his guidance she asked herself at times if he suspected how more than subtly how perversely she had dispensed with him and she balanced between visions of all he must privately have guessed and certitudes that he had guessed nothing whatever he might nevertheless have been so urbanely filling up gaps at present for the very reason that his instinct sharper than the expression of his face had sufficiently served him made him aware of the thin ice figuratively speaking and of prolongations of tension round about him mostly foreign to the circles in which luxury was akin to virtue some day in some happier season she would confess to him that she hadn t confessed though taking so much on her conscience but just now she was carrying in her weak stiffened hand a glass filled to the brim as to which she had recorded a vow that no drop should overflow she feared the very breath of a better wisdom the jostle of the higher light of heavenly help itself and in addition however that might be she drew breath this afternoon as never yet in an element heavy to oppression something grave had happened somehow and somewhere and she had god knew her choice of suppositions her heart stood still when she wondered above all if the cord mightn t at last have snapped between her husband and her father she shut her eyes for dismay at the possibility of such a passage there moved before them the procession of ugly forms it might have taken find out for yourself she had thrown to amerigo for her last word on the question of who else knew that night of the breaking of the bowl and she flattered herself that she hadn t since then helped him in her clear consistency by an inch it was what she had given him all these weeks to be busy with and she had again and again lain awake for the obsession of this sense of his uncertainty ruthlessly and endlessly playing with his dignity she had handed him over to an ignorance that couldn t even try to become indifferent and that yet wouldn t project itself either into the cleared air of conviction in proportion as he was generous it had bitten into his spirit and more than once she had said to herself that to break the spell she had cast upon him and that the polished old ivory of her father s inattackable surface made so absolute he would suddenly commit some mistake or some violence smash some windowpane for air fail even of one of his blest inveteracies of taste in that way fatally he would have put himself in the wrong blighting by a single false step the perfection of his outward show these shadows rose and fell for her while father mitchell prattled with other shadows as well those that hung over charlotte herself those that marked her as a prey to equal suspicions to the idea in particular of a change such a change as she didn t dare to face in the relations of the two men or there were yet other possibilities as it seemed to maggie there were always too many and all of them things of evil when one s nerves had at last done for one all that nerves could do had left one in a darkness of prowling dangers that was like the predicament of the night watcher in a beast haunted land who has no more means for a fire she might with such nerves have supposed almost anything of any one anything almost of poor bob assingham condemned to eternal observances and solemnly appreciating her father s wine anything verily yes of the good priest as he finally sat back with fat folded hands and twiddled his thumbs on his stomach the good priest looked hard at the decanters at the different dishes of dessert he eyed them half obliquely as if they might have met him to day for conversation better than any one present but the princess had her fancy at last about that too she was in the midst of a passage before she knew it between father mitchell and charlotte some approach he would have attempted with her that very morning perhaps to the circumstance of an apparent detachment recently noted in her from any practice of devotion he would have drawn from this say his artless inference taken it for a sign of some smothered inward trouble and pointed naturally the moral that the way out of such straits was not through neglect of the grand remedy he had possibly prescribed contrition he had at any rate quickened in her the beat of that false repose to which our young woman s own act had devoted her at her all so deluded instance the falsity of it had laid traps compared to which the imputation of treachery even accepted might have seemed a path of roses the acceptance strangely would have left her nothing to do she could have remained had she liked all insolently passive whereas the failure to proceed against her as it might have been called left her everything and all the more that it was wrapped so in confidence she had to confirm day after day the rightness of her cause and the justice and felicity of her exemption so that wouldn t there have been fairly in any explicit concern of father mitchell s depths of practical derision of her success the question was provisionally answered at all events by the time the party at luncheon had begun to disperse with maggie s version of mrs verver sharp to the point of representing her pretext for absence as a positive flight from derision she met the good priest s eyes before they separated and priests were really at the worst so to speak such wonderful people that she believed him for an instant on the verge of saying to her in abysmal softness go to mrs verver my child you go you ll find that you can help her this didn t come however nothing came but the renewed twiddle of thumbs over the satisfied stomach and the full flush the comical candour of reference to the hand employed at fawns for mayonnaise of salmon nothing came but the receding backs of each of the others her father s slightly bent shoulders in especial which seemed to weave his spell by the force of habit not less patiently than if his wife had been present her husband indeed was present to feel anything there might be to feel which was perhaps exactly why this personage was moved promptly to emulate so definite an example of sloping he had his occupations books to arrange perhaps even at fawns the idea of the siesta moreover in all the conditions had no need to be loudly invoked maggie was in the event left alone for a minute with mrs assingham who after waiting for safety appeared to have at heart to make a demonstration the stage of talking over had long passed for them when they communicated now it was on quite ultimate facts but fanny desired to testify to the existence on her part of an attention that nothing escaped she was like the kind lady who happening to linger at the circus while the rest of the spectators pour grossly through the exits falls in with the overworked little trapezist girl the acrobatic support presumably of embarrassed and exacting parents and gives her as an obscure and meritorious artist assurance of benevolent interest what was clearest always in our young woman s imaginings was the sense of being herself left for any occasion in the breach she was essentially there to bear the burden in the last resort of surrounding omissions and evasions and it was eminently to that office she had been to day abandoned with this one alleviation as appeared of mrs assingham s keeping up with her mrs assingham suggested that she too was still on the ramparts though her gallantry proved indeed after a moment to consist not a little of her curiosity she had looked about and seen their companions beyond earshot don t you really want us to go maggie found a faint smile do you really want to it made her friend colour well then no but we would you know at a look from you we d pack up and be off as a sacrifice ah make no sacrifice said maggie see me through that s it that s all i want i should be too base besides fanny went on you re too splendid splendid splendid also you know you are all but through you ve done it said mrs assingham but maggie only half took it from her what does it strike you that i ve done what you wanted they re going maggie continued to look at her is that what i wanted oh it wasn t for you to say that was his business my father s maggie asked after an hesitation your father s he has chosen and now she knows she sees it all before her and she can t speak or resist or move a little finger that s what s the matter with her said fanny assingham it made a picture somehow for the princess as they stood there the picture that the words of others whatever they might be always made for her even when her vision was already charged better than any words of her own she saw round about her through the chinks of the shutters the hard glare of nature saw charlotte somewhere in it virtually at bay and yet denied the last grace of any protecting truth she saw her off somewhere all unaided pale in her silence and taking in her fate has she told you she then asked her companion smiled superior i don t need to be told either i see something thank god every day and then as maggie might appear to be wondering what for instance i see the long miles of ocean and the dreadful great country state after state which have never seemed to me so big or so terrible i see them at last day by day and step by step at the far end and i see them never come back but never simply i see the extraordinary interesting place which i ve never been to you know and you have and the exact degree in which she will be expected to be interested she will be maggie presently replied expected interested for a little after this their eyes met on it at the end of which fanny said she ll be yes what she ll have to be and it will be won t it for ever and ever she spoke as abounding in her friend s sense but it made maggie still only look at her these were large words and large visions all the more that now really they spread and spread in the midst of them however mrs assingham had soon enough continued when i talk of knowing indeed i don t mean it as you would have a right to do you know because you see and i don t see him i don t make him out she almost crudely confessed maggie again hesitated you mean you don t make out amerigo but fanny shook her head and it was quite as if as an appeal to one s intelligence the making out of amerigo had in spite of everything long been superseded then maggie measured the reach of her allusion and how what she next said gave her meaning a richness no other name was to be spoken and mrs assingham had taken that without delay from her eyes with a discretion still that fell short but by an inch you know how he feels maggie at this then slowly matched her headshake i know nothing you know how you feel but again she denied it i know nothing if i did well if you did fanny asked as she faltered she had had enough however i should die she said as she turned away she went to her room through the quiet house she roamed there a moment picking up pointlessly a different fan and then took her way to the shaded apartments in which at this hour the principino would be enjoying his nap she passed through the first empty room the day nursery and paused at an open door the inner room large dim and cool was equally calm her boy s ample antique historical royal crib consecrated reputedly by the guarded rest of heirs apparent and a gift early in his career from his grandfather ruled the scene from the centre in the stillness of which she could almost hear the child s soft breathing the prime protector of his dreams was installed beside him her father sat there with as little motion with head thrown back and supported with eyes apparently closed with the fine foot that was so apt to betray nervousness at peace upon the other knee with the unfathomable heart folded in the constant flawless freshness of the white waistcoat that could always receive in its armholes the firm prehensile thumbs mrs noble had majestically melted and the whole place signed her temporary abdication yet the actual situation was regular and maggie lingered but to look she looked over her fan the top of which was pressed against her face long enough to wonder if her father really slept or if aware of her he only kept consciously quiet did his eyes truly fix her between lids partly open and was she to take this his forebearance from any question only as a sign again that everything was left to her she at all events for a minute watched his immobility then as if once more renewing her total submission returned without a sound to her own quarters a strange impulse was sharp in her but it was not for her part the desire to shift the weight she could as little have slept as she could have slept that morning days before when she had watched the first dawn from her window turned to the east this side of her room was now in shade with the two wings of the casement folded back and the charm she always found in her seemingly perched position as if her outlook from above the high terraces was that of some castle tower mounted on a rock when she stood there she hung over over the gardens and the woods all of which drowsed below her at this hour in the immensity of light the miles of shade looked hot the banks of flowers looked dim the peacocks on the balustrades let their tails hang limp and the smaller birds lurked among the leaves nothing therefore would have appeared to stir in the brilliant void if maggie at the moment she was about to turn away had not caught sight of a moving spot a clear green sunshade in the act of descending a flight of steps it passed down from the terrace receding at a distance from sight and carried naturally so as to conceal the head and back of its bearer but maggie had quickly recognised the white dress and the particular motion of this adventurer had taken in that charlotte of all people had chosen the glare of noon for an exploration of the gardens and that she could be betaking herself only to some unvisited quarter deep in them or beyond them that she had already marked as a superior refuge the princess kept her for a few minutes in sight watched her long enough to feel her by the mere betrayal of her pace and direction driven in a kind of flight and then understood for herself why the act of sitting still had become impossible to either of them there came to her confusedly some echo of an ancient fable some vision of io goaded by the gadfly or of ariadne roaming the lone sea strand it brought with it all the sense of her own intention and desire she too might have been for the hour some far off harassed heroine only with a part to play for which she knew exactly no inspiring precedent she knew but that all the while all the while of her sitting there among the others without her she had wanted to go straight to this detached member of the party and make somehow for her support the last demonstration a pretext was all that was needful and maggie after another instant had found one she had caught a glimpse before mrs verver disappeared of her carrying a book made out half lost in the folds of her white dress the dark cover of a volume that was to explain her purpose in case of her being met with surprise and the mate of which precisely now lay on maggie s table the book was an old novel that the princess had a couple of days before mentioned having brought down from portland place in the charming original form of its three volumes charlotte had hailed with a specious glitter of interest the opportunity to read it and our young woman had thereupon on the morrow directed her maid to carry it to mrs verver s apartments she was afterwards to observe that this messenger unintelligent or inadvertent had removed but one of the volumes which happened not to be the first still possessed accordingly of the first while charlotte going out fantastically at such an hour to cultivate romance in an arbour was helplessly armed with the second maggie prepared on the spot to sally forth with succour the right volume with a parasol was all she required in addition that is to the bravery of her general idea she passed again through the house unchallenged and emerged upon the terrace which she followed hugging the shade with that consciousness of turning the tables on her friend which we have already noted but so far as she went after descending into the open and beginning to explore the grounds mrs verver had gone still further with the increase of the oddity moreover of her having exchanged the protection of her room for these exposed and shining spaces it was not fortunately however at last that by persisting in pursuit one didn t arrive at regions of admirable shade this was the asylum presumably that the poor wandering woman had had in view several wide alleys in particular of great length densely overarched with the climbing rose and the honeysuckle and converging in separate green vistas at a sort of umbrageous temple an ancient rotunda pillared and statued niched and roofed yet with its uncorrected antiquity like that of everything else at fawns conscious hitherto of no violence from the present and no menace from the future charlotte had paused there in her frenzy or what ever it was to be called the place was a conceivable retreat and she was staring before her from the seat to which she appeared to have sunk all unwittingly as maggie stopped at the beginning of one of the perspectives it was a repetition more than ever then of the evening on the terrace the distance was too great to assure her she had been immediately seen but the princess waited with her intention as charlotte on the other occasion had waited allowing oh allowing for the difference of the intention maggie was full of the sense of that so full that it made her impatient whereupon she moved forward a little placing herself in range of the eyes that had been looking off elsewhere but that she had suddenly called to recognition charlotte had evidently not dreamed of being followed and instinctively with her pale stare she stiffened herself for protest maggie could make that out as well as further however that her second impression of her friend s approach had an instant effect on her attitude the princess came nearer gravely and in silence but fairly paused again to give her time for whatever she would whatever she would whatever she could was what maggie wanted wanting above all to make it as easy for her as the case permitted that was not what charlotte had wanted the other night but this never mattered the great thing was to allow her was fairly to produce in her the sense of highly choosing at first clearly she had been frightened she had not been pursued it had quickly struck her without some design on the part of her pursuer and what might she not be thinking of in addition but the way she had when herself the pursuer made her stepdaughter take in her spirit and her purpose it had sunk into maggie at the time that hard insistence and mrs verver had felt it and seen it and heard it sink which wonderful remembrance of pressure successfully applied had naturally till now remained with her but her stare was like a projected fear that the buried treasure so dishonestly come by for which her companion s still countenance at the hour and afterwards had consented to serve as the deep soil might have worked up again to the surface to be thrown back upon her hands yes it was positive that during one of these minutes the princess had the vision of her particular alarm it s her lie it s her lie that has mortally disagreed with her she can keep down no longer her rebellion at it and she has come to retract it to disown it and denounce it to give me full in my face the truth instead this for a concentrated instant maggie felt her helplessly gasp but only to let it bring home the indignity the pity of her state she herself could but tentatively hover place in view the book she carried look as little dangerous look as abjectly mild as possible remind herself really of people she had read about in stories of the wild west people who threw up their hands on certain occasions as a sign they weren t carrying revolvers she could almost have smiled at last troubled as she yet knew herself to show how richly she was harmless she held up her volume which was so weak a weapon and while she continued for consideration to keep her distance she explained with as quenched a quaver as possible i saw you come out saw you from my window and couldn t bear to think you should find yourself here without the beginning of your book this is the beginning you ve got the wrong volume and i ve brought you out the right she remained after she had spoken it was like holding a parley with a possible adversary and her intense her exalted little smile asked for formal leave may i come nearer now she seemed to say as to which however the next minute she saw charlotte s reply lose itself in a strange process a thing of several sharp stages which she could stand there and trace the dread after a minute had dropped from her face though discernibly enough she still couldn t believe in her having in so strange a fashion been deliberately made up to if she had been made up to at least it was with an idea the idea that had struck her at first as necessarily dangerous that it wasn t insistently wasn t this shone from maggie with a force finally not to be resisted and on that perception on the immense relief so constituted everything had by the end of three minutes extraordinarily changed maggie had come out to her really because she knew her doomed doomed to a separation that was like a knife in her heart and in the very sight of her uncontrollable her blinded physical quest of a peace not to be grasped something of mrs assingham s picture of her as thrown for a grim future beyond the great sea and the great continent had at first found fulfilment she had got away in this fashion burning behind her almost the ships of disguise to let her horror of what was before her play up without witnesses and even after maggie s approach had presented an innocent front it was still not to be mistaken that she bristled with the signs of her extremity it was not to be said for them either that they were draped at this hour in any of her usual graces unveiled and all but unashamed they were tragic to the princess in spite of the dissimulation that with the return of comparative confidence was so promptly to operate how tragic in essence the very change made vivid the instant stiffening of the spring of pride this for possible defence if not for possible aggression pride indeed the next moment had become the mantle caught up for protection and perversity she flung it round her as a denial of any loss of her freedom to be doomed was in her situation to have extravagantly incurred a doom so that to confess to wretchedness was by the same stroke to confess to falsity she wouldn t confess she didn t a thousand times no she only cast about her and quite frankly and fiercely for something else that would give colour to her having burst her bonds her eyes expanded her bosom heaved as she invoked it and the effect upon maggie was verily to wish she could only help her to it she presently got up which seemed to mean oh stay if you like and when she had moved about awhile at random looking away looking at anything at everything but her visitor when she had spoken of the temperature and declared that she revelled in it when she had uttered her thanks for the book which a little incoherently with her second volume she perhaps found less clever than she expected when she had let maggie approach sufficiently closer to lay untouched the tribute in question on a bench and take up obligingly its superfluous mate when she had done these things she sat down in another place more or less visibly in possession of her part our young woman was to have passed in all her adventure no stranger moments for she not only now saw her companion fairly agree to take her then for the poor little person she was finding it so easy to appear but fell in a secret responsive ecstasy to wondering if there were not some supreme abjection with which she might be inspired vague but increasingly brighter this possibility glimmered on her it at last hung there adequately plain to charlotte that she had presented herself once more to as they said grovel and that truly made the stage large it had absolutely within the time taken on the dazzling merit of being large for each of them alike i m glad to see you alone there s something i ve been wanting to say to you i m tired said mrs verver i m tired tired it had dropped the next thing it couldn t all come at once but maggie had already guessed what it was and the flush of recognition was in her face tired of this life the one we ve been leading you like it i know but i ve dreamed another dream she held up her head now her lighted eyes more triumphantly rested she was finding she was following her way maggie by the same influence sat in sight of it there was something she was saving some quantity of which she herself was judge and it was for a long moment even with the sacrifice the princess had come to make a good deal like watching her from the solid shore plunge into uncertain into possibly treacherous depths i see something else she went on i ve an idea that greatly appeals to me i ve had it for a long time it has come over me that we re wrong our real life isn t here maggie held her breath ours my husband s and mine i m not speaking for you oh said maggie only praying not to be not even to appear stupid i m speaking for ourselves i m speaking charlotte brought out for him i see for my father for your father for whom else they looked at each other hard now but maggie s face took refuge in the intensity of her interest she was not at all even so stupid as to treat her companion s question as requiring an answer a discretion that her controlled stillness had after an instant justified i must risk your thinking me selfish for of course you know what it involves let me admit it i am selfish i place my husband first well said maggie smiling and smiling since that s where i place mine you mean you ll have no quarrel with me so much the better then for charlotte went on with a higher and higher flight my plan is completely formed maggie waited her glimmer had deepened her chance somehow was at hand the only danger was her spoiling it she felt herself skirting an abyss what then may i ask is your plan it hung fire but ten seconds it came out sharp to take him home to his real position and not to wait do you mean a this season i mean immediately and i may as well tell you now i mean for my own time i want charlotte said to have him at last a little to myself i want strange as it may seem to you and she gave it all its weight to keep the man i ve married and to do so i see i must act maggie with the effort still to follow the right line felt herself colour to the eyes immediately she thoughtfully echoed as soon as we can get off the removal of everything is after all but a detail that can always be done with money as he spends it everything can what i ask for charlotte declared is the definite break and i wish it now with which her head like her voice rose higher oh she added i know my difficulty far down below the level of attention in she could scarce have said what sacred depths maggie s inspiration had come and it had trembled the next moment into sound do you mean i m your difficulty you and he together since it s always with you that i ve had to see him but it s a difficulty that i m facing if you wish to know that i ve already faced that i propose to myself to surmount the struggle with it none too pleasant hasn t been for me as you may imagine in itself charming i ve felt in it at times if i must tell you all too great and too strange an ugliness yet i believe it may succeed she had risen with this mrs verver and had moved for the emphasis of it a few steps away while maggie motionless at first but sat and looked at her you want to take my father from me the sharp successful almost primitive wail in it made charlotte turn and this movement attested for the princess the felicity of her deceit something in her throbbed as it had throbbed the night she stood in the drawing room and denied that she had suffered she was ready to lie again if her companion would but give her the opening then she should know she had done all charlotte looked at her hard as if to compare her face with her note of resentment and maggie feeling this met it with the signs of an impression that might pass for the impression of defeat i want really to possess him said mrs verver i happen also to feel that he s worth it maggie rose as if to receive her oh worth it she wonderfully threw off the tone she instantly saw again had its effect charlotte flamed aloft might truly have been believing in her passionate parade you ve thought you ve known what he s worth indeed then my dear i believe i have as i believe i still do she had given it maggie straight back and again it had not missed charlotte for another moment only looked at her then broke into the words maggie had known they would come of which she had pressed the spring how i see that you loathed our marriage do you ask me maggie after an instant demanded charlotte had looked about her picked up the parasol she had laid on a bench possessed herself mechanically of one of the volumes of the relegated novel and then more consciously flung it down again she was in presence visibly of her last word she opened her sunshade with a click she twirled it on her shoulder in her pride ask you do i need how i see she broke out that you ve worked against me oh oh oh the princess exclaimed her companion leaving her had reached one of the archways but on this turned round with a flare you haven t worked against me maggie took it and for a moment kept it held it with closed eyes as if it had been some captured fluttering bird pressed by both hands to her breast then she opened her eyes to speak what does it matter if i ve failed you recognise then that you ve failed asked charlotte from the threshold maggie waited she looked as her companion had done a moment before at the two books on the seat she put them together and laid them down then she made up her mind i ve failed she sounded out before charlotte having given her time walked away she watched her splendid and erect float down the long vista then she sank upon a seat yes she had done all part sixth xl i ll do anything you like she said to her husband on one of the last days of the month if our being here this way at this time seems to you too absurd or too uncomfortable or too impossible we ll either take leave of them now without waiting or we ll come back in time three days before they start i ll go abroad with you if you but say the word to switzerland the tyrol the italian alps to whichever of your old high places you would like most to see again those beautiful ones that used to do you good after rome and that you so often told me about where they were in the conditions that prompted this offer and where it might indeed appear ridiculous that with the stale london september close at hand they should content themselves with remaining was where the desert of portland place looked blank as it had never looked and where a drowsy cabman scanning the horizon for a fare could sink to oblivion of the risks of immobility but amerigo was of the odd opinion day after day that their situation couldn t be bettered and he even went at no moment through the form of replying that should their ordeal strike her as exceeding their patience any step they might take would be for her own relief this was no doubt partly because he stood out so wonderfully to the end against admitting by a weak word at least that any element of their existence was or ever had been an ordeal no trap of circumstance no lapse of form no accident of irritation had landed him in that inconsequence his wife might verily have suggested that he was consequent consequent with the admirable appearance he had from the first so undertaken and so continued to present rather too rigidly at her expense only as it happened she was not the little person to do anything of the sort and the strange tacit compact actually in operation between them might have been founded on an intelligent comparison a definite collation positively of the kinds of patience proper to each she was seeing him through he had engaged to come out at the right end if she would see him this understanding tacitly renewed from week to week had fairly received with the procession of the weeks the consecration of time but it scarce needed to be insisted on that she was seeing him on his terms not all on hers or that in other words she must allow him his unexplained and uncharted his one practicably workable way if that way by one of the intimate felicities the liability to which was so far from having even yet completely fallen from him happened handsomely to show him as more bored than boring with advantages of his own freely to surrender but none to be persuadedly indebted to others for what did such a false face of the matter represent but the fact itself that she was pledged if she had questioned or challenged or interfered if she had reserved herself that right she wouldn t have been pledged whereas there were still and evidently would be yet a while long tense stretches during which their case might have been hanging for every eye on her possible her impossible defection she must keep it up to the last mustn t absent herself for three minutes from her post only on those lines assuredly would she show herself as with him and not against him it was extraordinary how scant a series of signs she had invited him to make of being of truly having been at any time with his wife that reflection she was not exempt from as they now in their suspense supremely waited a reflection under the brush of which she recognised her having had in respect to him as well to do all to go the whole way over to move indefatigably while he stood as fixed in his place as some statue of one of his forefathers the meaning of it would seem to be she reasoned in sequestered hours that he had a place and that this was an attribute somehow indefeasible unquenchable which laid upon others from the moment they definitely wanted anything of him the necessity of taking more of the steps that he could of circling round him of remembering for his benefit the famous relation of the mountain to mahomet it was strange if one had gone into it but such a place as amerigo s was like something made for him beforehand by innumerable facts facts largely of the sort known as historical made by ancestors examples traditions habits while maggie s own had come to show simply as that improvised post a post of the kind spoken of as advanced with which she was to have found herself connected in the fashion of a settler or a trader in a new country in the likeness even of some indian squaw with a papoose on her back and barbarous bead work to sell maggie s own in short would have been sought in vain in the most rudimentary map of the social relations as such the only geography marking it would be doubtless that of the fundamental passions the end that the prince was at all events holding out for was represented to expectation by his father in law s announced departure for america with mrs verver just as that prospective event had originally figured as advising for discretion the flight of the younger couple to say nothing of the withdrawal of whatever other importunate company before the great upheaval of fawns this residence was to be peopled for a month by porters packers and hammerers at whose operations it had become peculiarly public public that is for portland place that charlotte was to preside in force operations the quite awful appointed scale and style of which had at no moment loomed so large to maggie s mind as one day when the dear assinghams swam back into her ken besprinkled with sawdust and looking as pale as if they had seen samson pull down the temple they had seen at least what she was not seeing rich dim things under the impression of which they had retired she having eyes at present but for the clock by which she timed her husband or for the glass the image perhaps would be truer in which he was reflected to her as he timed the pair in the country the accession of their friends from cadogan place contributed to all their intermissions at any rate a certain effect of resonance an effect especially marked by the upshot of a prompt exchange of inquiries between mrs assingham and the princess it was noted on the occasion of that anxious lady s last approach to her young friend at fawns that her sympathy had ventured after much accepted privation again to become inquisitive and it had perhaps never so yielded to that need as on this question of the present odd line of the distinguished eccentrics you mean to say really that you re going to stick here and then before maggie could answer what on earth will you do with your evenings maggie waited a moment maggie could still tentatively smile when people learn we re here and of course the papers will be full of it they ll flock back in their hundreds from wherever they are to catch us you see you and the colonel have yourselves done it as for our evenings they won t i dare say be particularly different from anything else that s ours they won t be different from our mornings or our afternoons except perhaps that you two dears will sometimes help us to get through them i ve offered to go anywhere she added to take a house if he will but this just this and nothing else is amerigo s idea he gave it yesterday she went on a name that as he said described and fitted it so you see and the princess indulged again in her smile that didn t play but that only as might have been said worked so you see there s a method in our madness it drew mrs assingham s wonder and what then is the name the reduction to its simplest expression of what we are doing that s what he called it therefore as we re doing nothing we re doing it in the most aggravated way which is the way he desires with which maggie further said of course i understand so do i her visitor after a moment breathed you ve had to vacate the house that was inevitable but at least here he doesn t funk our young woman accepted the expression he doesn t funk it only however half contented fanny who thoughtfully raised her eyebrows he s prodigious but what is there as you ve fixed it to dodge unless she pursued it s her getting near him it s if you ll pardon my vulgarity her getting at him that she suggested may count with him but it found the princess prepared she can get near him here she can get at him she can come up can she fanny assingham questioned can t she maggie returned their eyes for a minute intimately met on it after which the elder woman said i mean for seeing him alone so do i said the princess at which fanny for her reasons couldn t help smiling oh if it s for that he s staying he s staying i ve made it out to take anything that comes or calls upon him to take maggie went on even that then she put it as she had at last put it to herself he s staying for high decency decency mrs assingham gravely echoed decency if she should try well mrs assingham urged well i hope hope he ll see her maggie hesitated however she made no direct reply it s useless hoping she presently said she won t but he ought to her friend s expression of a moment before which had been apologised for as vulgar prolonged its sharpness to her ear that of an electric bell under continued pressure stated so simply what was it but dreadful truly that the feasibility of charlotte s getting at the man who for so long had loved her should now be in question strangest of all things doubtless this care of maggie s as to what might make for it or make against it stranger still her fairly lapsing at moments into a vague calculation of the conceivability on her own part with her husband of some direct sounding of the subject would it be too monstrous her suddenly breaking out to him as in alarm at the lapse of the weeks wouldn t it really seem that you re bound in honour to do something for her privately before they go maggie was capable of weighing the risk of this adventure for her own spirit capable of sinking to intense little absences even while conversing as now with the person who had most of her confidence during which she followed up the possibilities it was true that mrs assingham could at such times somewhat restore the balance by not wholly failing to guess her thought her thought however just at present had more than one face had a series that it successively presented these were indeed the possibilities involved in the adventure of her concerning herself for the quantity of compensation that mrs verver might still look to there was always the possibility that she was after all sufficiently to get at him there was in fact that of her having again and again done so against this stood nothing but fanny assingham s apparent belief in her privation more mercilessly imposed or more hopelessly felt in the actual relation of the parties over and beyond everything that from more than three months back of course had fostered in the princess a like conviction these assumptions might certainly be baseless inasmuch as there were hours and hours of amerigo s time that there was no habit no pretence of his accounting for inasmuch too as charlotte inevitably had had more than once to the undisguised knowledge of the pair in portland place been obliged to come up to eaton square whence so many of her personal possessions were in course of removal she didn t come to portland place didn t even come to ask for luncheon on two separate occasions when it reached the consciousness of the household there that she was spending the day in london maggie hated she scorned to compare hours and appearances to weigh the idea of whether there hadn t been moments during these days when an assignation in easy conditions a snatched interview in an air the season had so cleared of prying eyes mightn t perfectly work but the very reason of this was partly that haunted with the vision of the poor woman carrying off with such bravery as she found to her hand the secret of her not being appeased she was conscious of scant room for any alternative image the alternative image would have been that the secret covered up was the secret of appeasement somehow obtained somehow extorted and cherished and the difference between the two kinds of hiding was too great to permit of a mistake charlotte was hiding neither pride nor joy she was hiding humiliation and here it was that the princess s passion so powerless for vindictive flights most inveterately bruised its tenderness against the hard glass of her question behind the glass lurked the whole history of the relation she had so fairly flattened her nose against it to penetrate the glass mrs verver might at this stage have been frantically tapping from within by way of supreme irrepressible entreaty maggie had said to herself complacently after that last passage with her stepmother in the garden of fawns that there was nothing left for her to do and that she could thereupon fold her hands but why wasn t it still left to push further and from the point of view of personal pride grovel lower why wasn t it still left to offer herself as the bearer of a message reporting to him their friend s anguish and convincing him of her need she could thus have translated mrs verver s tap against the glass as i have called it into fifty forms could perhaps have translated it most into the form of a reminder that would pierce deep you don t know what it is to have been loved and broken with you haven t been broken with because in your relation what can there have been worth speaking of to break ours was everything a relation could be filled to the brim with the wine of consciousness and if it was to have no meaning no better meaning than that such a creature as you could breathe upon it at your hour for blight why was i myself dealt with all for deception why condemned after a couple of short years to find the golden flame oh the golden flame a mere handful of black ashes our young woman so yielded at moments to what was insidious in these foredoomed ingenuities of her pity that for minutes together sometimes the weight of a new duty seemed to rest upon her the duty of speaking before separation should constitute its chasm of pleading for some benefit that might be carried away into exile like the last saved object of price of the emigre the jewel wrapped in a piece of old silk and negotiable some day in the market of misery this imagined service to the woman who could no longer help herself was one of the traps set for maggie s spirit at every turn of the road the click of which catching and holding the divine faculty fast was followed inevitably by a flutter by a struggle of wings and even as we may say by a scattering of fine feathers for they promptly enough felt these yearnings of thought and excursions of sympathy the concussion that couldn t bring them down the arrest produced by the so remarkably distinct figure that at fawns for the previous weeks was constantly crossing in its regular revolution the further end of any watched perspective whoever knew or whoever didn t whether or to what extent charlotte with natural business in eaton square had shuffled other opportunities under that cloak it was all matter for the kind of quiet ponderation the little man who so kept his wandering way had made his own it was part of the very inveteracy of his straw hat and his white waistcoat of the trick of his hands in his pockets of the detachment of the attention he fixed on his slow steps from behind his secure pince nez the thing that never failed now as an item in the picture was that gleam of the silken noose his wife s immaterial tether so marked to maggie s sense during her last month in the country mrs verver s straight neck had certainly not slipped it nor had the other end of the long cord oh quite conveniently long disengaged its smaller loop from the hooked thumb that with his fingers closed upon it her husband kept out of sight to have recognised for all its tenuity the play of this gathered lasso might inevitably be to wonder with what magic it was twisted to what tension subjected but could never be to doubt either of its adequacy to its office or of its perfect durability these reminded states for the princess were in fact states of renewed gaping so many things her father knew that she even yet didn t all this at present with mrs assingham passed through her in quick vibrations she had expressed while the revolution of her thought was incomplete the idea of what amerigo ought on his side in the premises to be capable of and then had felt her companion s answering stare but she insisted on what she had meant he ought to wish to see her and i mean in some protected and independent way as he used to in case of her being herself able to manage it that said maggie with the courage of her conviction he ought to be ready he ought to be happy he ought to feel himself sworn little as it is for the end of such a history to take from her it s as if he wished to get off without taking anything mrs assingham deferentially mused but for what purpose is it your idea that they should again so intimately meet for any purpose they like that s their affair fanny assingham sharply laughed then irrepressibly fell back to her constant position you re splendid perfectly splendid to which as the princess shaking an impatient head wouldn t have it again at all she subjoined or if you re not it s because you re so sure i mean sure of him ah i m exactly not sure of him if i were sure of him i shouldn t doubt but maggie cast about her doubt what fanny pressed as she waited well that he must feel how much less than she he pays and how that ought to keep her present to him this in its turn after an instant mrs assingham could meet with a smile trust him my dear to keep her present but trust him also to keep himself absent leave him his own way i ll leave him everything said maggie only you know it s my nature i think it s your nature to think too much fanny assingham a trifle coarsely risked this but quickened however in the princess the act she reprobated that may be but if i hadn t thought you wouldn t you mean have been where you are yes because they on their side thought of everything but that they thought of everything but that i might think or even her friend too superficially concurred that your father might as to this at all events maggie discriminated no that wouldn t have prevented them for they knew that his first care would be not to make me do so as it is maggie added that has had to become his last fanny assingham took it in deeper for what it immediately made her give out louder he s splendid then she sounded it almost aggressively it was what she was reduced to she had positively to place it ah that as much as you please maggie said this and left it but the tone of it had the next moment determined in her friend a fresh reaction you think both of you so abysmally and yet so quietly but it s what will have saved you oh maggie returned it s what from the moment they discovered we could think at all will have saved them for they re the ones who are saved she went on we re the ones who are lost lost lost to each other father and i and then as her friend appeared to demur oh yes maggie quite lucidly declared lost to each other much more really than amerigo and charlotte are since for them it s just it s right it s deserved while for us it s only sad and strange and not caused by our fault but i don t know she went on why i talk about myself for it s on father it really comes i let him go said maggie you let him but you don t make him i take it from him she answered but what else can you do i take it from him the princess repeated i do what i knew from the first i should do i get off by giving him up but if he gives you mrs assingham presumed to object doesn t it moreover then she asked complete the very purpose with which he married that of making you and leaving you more free maggie looked at her long yes i help him to do that mrs assingham hesitated but at last her bravery flared why not call it then frankly his complete success well said maggie that s all that s left me to do it s a success her friend ingeniously developed with which you ve simply not interfered and as if to show that she spoke without levity mrs assingham went further he has made it a success for them ah there you are maggie responsively mused yes she said the next moment that s why amerigo stays let alone it s why charlotte goes that mrs assingham and emboldened smiled so he knows but maggie hung back amerigo after which however she blushed to her companion s recognition your father he knows what you know i mean fanny faltered well how much does he know maggie s silence and maggie s eyes had in fact arrested the push of the question which for a decent consistency she couldn t yet quite abandon what i should rather say is does he know how much she found it still awkward how much i mean they did how far she touched it up they went maggie had waited but only with a question do you think he does know at least something oh about him i can t think he s beyond me said fanny assingham then do you yourself know how much how much how far how far fanny had appeared to wish to make sure but there was something she remembered remembered in time and even with a smile i ve told you before that i know absolutely nothing well that s what i know said the princess her friend again hesitated then nobody knows i mean mrs assingham explained how much your father does oh maggie showed that she understood nobody not a little charlotte a little the princess echoed to know anything would be for her to know enough and she doesn t know anything if she did maggie answered amerigo would and that s just it that he doesn t that s just it said the princess profoundly on which mrs assingham reflected then how is charlotte so held just by that by her ignorance by her ignorance fanny wondered a torment a torment said maggie with tears in her eyes her companion a moment watched them but the prince then how is he held maggie asked how is he held oh i can t tell you that and the princess again broke off xli a telegram in charlotte s name arrived early we shall come and ask you for tea at five if convenient to you am wiring for the assinghams to lunch this document into which meanings were to be read maggie promptly placed before her husband adding the remark that her father and his wife who would have come up the previous night or that morning had evidently gone to an hotel the prince was in his own room where he often sat now alone half a dozen open newspapers the figaro notably as well as the times were scattered about him but with a cigar in his teeth and a visible cloud on his brow he appeared actually to be engaged in walking to and fro never yet on thus approaching him for she had done it of late under one necessity or another several times had a particular impression so greeted her supremely strong for some reason as he turned quickly round on her entrance the reason was partly the look in his face a suffusion like the flush of fever which brought back to her fanny assingham s charge recently uttered under that roof of her thinking too impenetrably the word had remained with her and made her think still more so that at first as she stood there she felt responsible for provoking on his part an irritation of suspense at which she had not aimed she had been going about him these three months she perfectly knew with a maintained idea of which she had never spoken to him but what had at last happened was that his way of looking at her on occasion seemed a perception of the presence not of one idea but of fifty variously prepared for uses with which he somehow must reckon she knew herself suddenly almost strangely glad to be coming to him at this hour with nothing more abstract than a telegram but even after she had stepped into his prison under her pretext while her eyes took in his face and then embraced the four walls that enclosed his restlessness she recognised the virtual identity of his condition with that aspect of charlotte s situation for which early in the summer and in all the amplitude of a great residence she had found with so little seeking the similitude of the locked cage he struck her as caged the man who couldn t now without an instant effect on her sensibility give an instinctive push to the door she had not completely closed behind her he had been turning twenty ways for impatiences all his own and when she was once shut in with him it was yet again as if she had come to him in his more than monastic cell to offer him light or food there was a difference none the less between his captivity and charlotte s the difference as it might be of his lurking there by his own act and his own choice the admission of which had indeed virtually been in his starting on her entrance as if even this were in its degree an interference that was what betrayed for her practically his fear of her fifty ideas and what had begun after a minute to make her wish to repudiate or explain it was more wonderful than she could have told it was for all the world as if she was succeeding with him beyond her intention she had for these instants the sense that he exaggerated that the imputation of purpose had fairly risen too high in him she had begun a year ago by asking herself how she could make him think more of her but what was it after all he was thinking now he kept his eyes on her telegram he read it more than once easy as it was in spite of its conveyed deprecation to understand during which she found herself almost awestruck with yearning almost on the point of marking somehow what she had marked in the garden at fawns with charlotte that she had truly come unarmed she didn t bristle with intentions she scarce knew as he at this juncture affected her what had become of the only intention she had come with she had nothing but her old idea the old one he knew she hadn t the ghost of another presently in fact when four or five minutes had elapsed it was as if she positively hadn t so much even as that one he gave her back her paper asking with it if there were anything in particular she wished him to do she stood there with her eyes on him doubling the telegram together as if it had been a precious thing and yet all the while holding her breath of a sudden somehow and quite as by the action of their merely having between them these few written words an extraordinary fact came up he was with her as if he were hers hers in a degree and on a scale with an intensity and an intimacy that were a new and a strange quantity that were like the irruption of a tide loosening them where they had stuck and making them feel they floated what was it that with the rush of this just kept her from putting out her hands to him from catching at him as in the other time with the superficial impetus he and charlotte had privately conspired to impart she had so often her breath failing her known the impulse to catch at her father she did however just yet nothing inconsequent though she couldn t immediately have said what saved her and by the time she had neatly folded her telegram she was doing something merely needful i wanted you simply to know so that you mayn t by accident miss them for it s the last said maggie the last i take it as their good bye and she smiled as she could always smile they come in state to take formal leave they do everything that s proper tomorrow she said they go to southampton if they do everything that s proper the prince presently asked why don t they at least come to dine she hesitated yet she lightly enough provided her answer that we must certainly ask them it will be easy for you but of course they re immensely taken he wondered so immensely taken that they can t that your father can t give you his last evening in england this for maggie was more difficult to meet yet she was still not without her stop gap that may be what they ll propose that we shall go somewhere together the four of us for a celebration except that to round it thoroughly off we ought also to have fanny and the colonel they don t want them at tea she quite sufficiently expresses they polish them off poor dears they get rid of them beforehand they want only us together and if they cut us down to tea she continued as they cut fanny and the colonel down to luncheon perhaps it s for the fancy after all of their keeping their last night in london for each other she said these things as they came to her she was unable to keep them back even though as she heard herself she might have been throwing everything to the winds but wasn t that the right way for sharing his last day of captivity with the man one adored it was every moment more and more for her as if she were waiting with him in his prison waiting with some gleam of remembrance of how noble captives in the french revolution the darkness of the terror used to make a feast or a high discourse of their last poor resources if she had broken with everything now every observance of all the past months she must simply then take it so take it that what she had worked for was too near at last to let her keep her head she might have been losing her head verily in her husband s eyes since he didn t know all the while that the sudden freedom of her words was but the diverted intensity of her disposition personally to seize him he didn t know either that this was her manner now she was with him of beguiling audaciously the supremacy of suspense for the people of the french revolution assuredly there wasn t suspense the scaffold for those she was thinking of was certain whereas what charlotte s telegram announced was short of some incalculable error clear liberation just the point however was in its being clearer to herself than to him her clearnesses clearances those she had so all but abjectly laboured for threatened to crowd upon her in the form of one of the clusters of angelic heads the peopled shafts of light beating down through iron bars that regale on occasion precisely the fevered vision of those who are in chains she was going to know she felt later on was going to know with compunction doubtless on the very morrow how thumpingly her heart had beaten at this foretaste of their being left together she should judge at leisure the surrender she was making to the consciousness of complications about to be bodily lifted she should judge at leisure even that avidity for an issue which was making so little of any complication but the unextinguished presence of the others and indeed that she was already simplifying so much more than her husband came out for her next in the face with which he listened he might certainly well be puzzled in respect to his father in law and mrs verver by her glance at their possible preference for a concentrated evening but it isn t is it he asked as if they were leaving each other oh no it isn t as if they were leaving each other they re only bringing to a close without knowing when it may open again a time that has been naturally awfully interesting to them yes she could talk so of their time she was somehow sustained she was sustained even to affirm more intensely her present possession of her ground they have their reasons many things to think of how can one tell but there s always also the chance of his proposing to me that we shall have our last hours together i mean that he and i shall he may wish to take me off to dine with him somewhere alone and to do it in memory of old days i mean the princess went on the real old days before my grand husband was invented and much more before his grand wife was the wonderful times of his first great interest in what he has since done his first great plans and opportunities discoveries and bargains the way we ve sat together late ever so late in foreign restaurants which he used to like the way that in every city in europe we ve stayed on and on with our elbows on the table and most of the lights put out to talk over things he had that day seen or heard of or made his offer for the things he had secured or refused or lost there were places he took me to you wouldn t believe for often he could only have left me with servants if he should carry me off with him to night for old sake s sake to the earl s court exhibition it will be a little just a very very little like our young adventures after which while amerigo watched her and in fact quite because of it she had an inspiration to which she presently yielded if he was wondering what she would say next she had found exactly the thing in that case he will leave you charlotte to take care of in our absence you ll have to carry her off somewhere for your last evening unless you may prefer to spend it with her here i shall then see that you dine that you have everything quite beautifully you ll be able to do as you like she couldn t have been sure beforehand and had really not been but the most immediate result of this speech was his letting her see that he took it for no cheap extravagance either of irony or of oblivion nothing in the world of a truth had ever been so sweet to her as his look of trying to be serious enough to make no mistake about it she troubled him which hadn t been at all her purpose she mystified him which she couldn t help and comparatively didn t mind then it came over her that he had after all a simplicity very considerable on which she had never dared to presume it was a discovery not like the other discovery she had once made but giving out a freshness and she recognised again in the light of it the number of the ideas of which he thought her capable they were all apparently queer for him but she had at least with the lapse of the months created the perception that there might be something in them whereby he stared there beautiful and sombre at what she was at present providing him with there was something of his own in his mind to which she was sure he referred everything for a measure and a meaning he had never let go of it from the evening weeks before when in her room after his encounter with the bloomsbury cup she had planted it there by flinging it at him on the question of her father s view of him her determined find out for yourself she had been aware during the months that he had been trying to find out and had been seeking above all to avoid the appearance of any evasions of such a form of knowledge as might reach him with violence or with a penetration more insidious from any other source nothing however had reached him nothing he could at all conveniently reckon with had disengaged itself for him even from the announcement sufficiently sudden of the final secession of their companions charlotte was in pain charlotte was in torment but he himself had given her reason enough for that and in respect to the rest of the whole matter of her obligation to follow her husband that personage and she maggie had so shuffled away every link between consequence and cause that the intention remained like some famous poetic line in a dead language subject to varieties of interpretation what renewed the obscurity was her strange image of their common offer to him her father s and her own of an opportunity to separate from mrs verver with the due amount of form and all the more that he was in so pathetic a way unable to treat himself to a quarrel with it on the score of taste taste in him as a touchstone was now all at sea for who could say but that one of her fifty ideas or perhaps forty nine of them wouldn t be exactly that taste by itself the taste he had always conformed to had no importance whatever if meanwhile at all events he felt her as serious this made the greater reason for her profiting by it as she perhaps might never be able to profit again she was invoking that reflection at the very moment he brought out in reply to her last words a remark which though perfectly relevant and perfectly just affected her at first as a high oddity they re doing the wisest thing you know for if they were ever to go and he looked down at her over his cigar if they were ever to go in short it was high time with her father s age charlotte s need of initiation and the general magnitude of the job of their getting settled and seasoned their learning to live into their queer future it was high time that they should take up their courage this was eminent sense but it didn t arrest the princess who the next moment had found a form for her challenge but shan t you then so much as miss her a little she s wonderful and beautiful and i feel somehow as if she were dying not really not physically maggie went on she s so far naturally splendid as she is from having done with life but dying for us for you and me and making us feel it by the very fact of there being so much of her left the prince smoked hard a minute as you say she s splendid but there is there always will be much of her left only as you also say for others and yet i think the princess returned that it isn t as if we had wholly done with her how can we not always think of her it s as if her unhappiness had been necessary to us as if we had needed her at her own cost to build us up and start us he took it in with consideration but he met it with a lucid inquiry why do you speak of the unhappiness of your father s wife they exchanged a long look the time that it took her to find her reply because not to well not to would make me have to speak of him and i can t said maggie speak of him you can t i can t she said it as for definite notice not to be repeated there are too many things she nevertheless added he s too great the prince looked at his cigar tip and then as he put back the weed too great for whom upon which as she hesitated not my dear too great for you he declared for me oh as much as you like too great for me is what i mean i know why i think it maggie said that s enough he looked at her yet again as if she but fanned his wonder he was on the very point she judged of asking her why she thought it but her own eyes maintained their warning and at the end of a minute he had uttered other words what s of importance is that you re his daughter that at least we ve got and i suppose that if i may say nothing else i may say at least that i value it oh yes you may say that you value it i myself make the most of it this again he took in letting it presently put forth for him a striking connection she ought to have known you that s what s present to me she ought to have understood you better better than you did yes he gravely maintained better than i did and she didn t really know you at all she doesn t know you now ah yes she does said maggie but he shook his head he knew what he meant she not only doesn t understand you more than i she understands you ever so much less though even i well even you maggie pressed as he paused even i even i even yet again he paused and the silence held them but maggie at last broke it if charlotte doesn t understand me it is that i ve prevented her i ve chosen to deceive her and to lie to her the prince kept his eyes on her i know what you ve chosen to do but i ve chosen to do the same yes said maggie after an instant my choice was made when i had guessed yours but you mean she asked that she understands you it presents small difficulty are you so sure maggie went on sure enough but it doesn t matter he waited an instant then looking up through the fumes of his smoke she s stupid he abruptly opined o oh maggie protested in a long wail it had made him in fact quickly change colour what i mean is that she s not as you pronounce her unhappy and he recovered with this all his logic why is she unhappy if she doesn t know doesn t know she tried to make his logic difficult doesn t know that you know it came from him in such a way that she was conscious instantly of three or four things to answer but what she said first was do you think that s all it need take and before he could reply she knows she knows maggie proclaimed well then what but she threw back her head she turned impatiently away from him oh i needn t tell you she knows enough besides she went on she doesn t believe us it made the prince stare a little ah she asks too much that drew however from his wife another moan of objection which determined in him a judgment she won t let you take her for unhappy oh i know better than any one else what she won t let me take her for very well said amerigo you ll see i shall see wonders i know i ve already seen them and i m prepared for them maggie recalled she had memories enough it s terrible her memories prompted her to speak i see it s always terrible for women the prince looked down in his gravity everything s terrible cara in the heart of man she s making her life he said she ll make it his wife turned back upon him she had wandered to a table vaguely setting objects straight a little by the way then too while she s about it she s making ours at this he raised his eyes which met her own and she held him while she delivered herself of some thing that had been with her these last minutes you spoke just now of charlotte s not having learned from you that i know am i to take from you then that you accept and recognise my knowledge he did the inquiry all the honours visibly weighed its importance and weighed his response you think i might have been showing you that a little more handsomely it isn t a question of any beauty said maggie it s only a question of the quantity of truth oh the quantity of truth the prince richly though ambiguously murmured that s a thing by itself yes but there are also such things all the same as questions of good faith of course there are the prince hastened to reply after which he brought up more slowly if ever a man since the beginning of time acted in good faith but he dropped it offering it simply for that for that then when it had had time somewhat to settle like some handful of gold dust thrown into the air for that then maggie showed herself as deeply and strangely taking it i see and she even wished this form to be as complete as she could make it i see the completeness clearly after an instant had struck him as divine ah my dear my dear my dear it was all he could say she wasn t talking however at large you ve kept up for so long a silence yes yes i know what i ve kept up but will you do he asked still one thing more for me it was as if for an instant with her new exposure it had made her turn pale is there even one thing left ah my dear my dear my dear it had pressed again in him the fine spring of the unspeakable there was nothing however that the princess herself couldn t say i ll do anything if you ll tell me what then wait and his raised italian hand with its play of admonitory fingers had never made gesture more expressive his voice itself dropped to a tone wait he repeated wait she understood but it was as if she wished to have it from him till they ve been here you mean yes till they ve gone till they re away she kept it up till they ve left the country she had her eyes on him for clearness these were the conditions of a promise so that he put the promise practically into his response till we ve ceased to see them for as long as god may grant till we re really alone oh if it s only that when she had drawn from him thus then as she could feel the thick breath of the definite which was the intimate the immediate the familiar as she hadn t had them for so long she turned away again she put her hand on the knob of the door but her hand rested at first without a grasp she had another effort to make the effort of leaving him of which everything that had just passed between them his presence irresistible overcharged with it doubled the difficulty there was something she couldn t have told what it was as if shut in together they had come too far too far for where they were so that the mere act of her quitting him was like the attempt to recover the lost and gone she had taken in with her something that within the ten minutes and especially within the last three or four had slipped away from her which it was vain now wasn t it to try to appear to clutch or to pick up that consciousness in fact had a pang and she balanced intensely for the lingering moment almost with a terror of her endless power of surrender he had only to press really for her to yield inch by inch and she fairly knew at present while she looked at him through her cloud that the confession of this precious secret sat there for him to pluck the sensation for the few seconds was extraordinary her weakness her desire so long as she was yet not saving herself flowered in her face like a light or a darkness she sought for some word that would cover this up she reverted to the question of tea speaking as if they shouldn t meet sooner then about five i count on you on him too however something had descended as to which this exactly gave him his chance ah but i shall see you no he said coming nearer she had with her hand still on the knob her back against the door so that her retreat under his approach must be less than a step and yet she couldn t for her life with the other hand have pushed him away he was so near now that she could touch him taste him smell him kiss him hold him he almost pressed upon her and the warmth of his face frowning smiling she mightn t know which only beautiful and strange was bent upon her with the largeness with which objects loom in dreams she closed her eyes to it and so the next instant against her purpose she had put out her hand which had met his own and which he held then it was that from behind her closed eyes the right word came wait it was the word of his own distress and entreaty the word for both of them all they had left their plank now on the great sea their hands were locked and thus she said it again wait wait she kept her eyes shut but her hand she knew helped her meaning which after a minute she was aware his own had absorbed he let her go he turned away with this message and when she saw him again his back was presented as he had left her and his face staring out of the window she had saved herself and she got off xlii later on in the afternoon before the others arrived the form of their reunion was at least remarkable they might in their great eastward drawing room have been comparing notes or nerves in apprehension of some stiff official visit maggie s mind in its restlessness even played a little with the prospect the high cool room with its afternoon shade with its old tapestries uncovered with the perfect polish of its wide floor reflecting the bowls of gathered flowers and the silver and linen of the prepared tea table drew from her a remark in which this whole effect was mirrored as well as something else in the prince s movement while he slowly paced and turned we re distinctly bourgeois she a trifle grimly threw off as an echo of their old community though to a spectator sufficiently detached they might have been quite the privileged pair they were reputed granted only they were taken as awaiting the visit of royalty they might have been ready on the word passed up in advance to repair together to the foot of the staircase the prince somewhat in front advancing indeed to the open doors and even going down for all his princedom to meet on the stopping of the chariot the august emergence the time was stale it was to be admitted for incidents of magnitude the september hush was in full possession at the end of the dull day and a couple of the long windows stood open to the balcony that overhung the desolation the balcony from which maggie in the springtime had seen amerigo and charlotte look down together at the hour of her return from the regent s park near by with her father the principino and miss bogle amerigo now again in his punctual impatience went out a couple of times and stood there after which as to report that nothing was in sight he returned to the room with frankly nothing else to do the princess pretended to read he looked at her as he passed there hovered in her own sense the thought of other occasions when she had cheated appearances of agitation with a book at last she felt him standing before her and then she raised her eyes do you remember how this morning when you told me of this event i asked you if there were anything particular you wished me to do you spoke of my being at home but that was a matter of course you spoke of something else he went on while she sat with her book on her knee and her raised eyes something that makes me almost wish it may happen you spoke he said of the possibility of my seeing her alone do you know if that comes he asked the use i shall make of it and then as she waited the use is all before me ah it s your own business now said his wife but it had made her rise i shall make it my own he answered i shall tell her i lied to her ah no she returned and i shall tell her you did she shook her head again oh still less with which therefore they stood at difference he with his head erect and his happy idea perched in its eagerness on his crest and how then is she to know she isn t to know she s only still to think you don t and therefore that i m always a fool she may think said maggie what she likes think it without my protest the princess made a movement what business is it of yours isn t it my right to correct her maggie let his question ring ring long enough for him to hear it himself only then she took it up correct her and it was her own now that really rang aren t you rather forgetting who she is after which while he quite stared for it as it was the very first clear majesty he had known her to use she flung down her book and raised a warning hand the carriage come the come had matched for lucid firmness the rest of her speech and when they were below in the hall there was a go for him through the open doors and between the ranged servants that matched even that he received royalty bareheaded therefore in the persons of mr and mrs verver as it alighted on the pavement and maggie was at the threshold to welcome it to her house later on upstairs again she even herself felt still more the force of the limit of which she had just reminded him at tea in charlotte s affirmed presence as charlotte affirmed it she drew a long breath of richer relief it was the strangest once more of all impressions but what she most felt for the half hour was that mr and mrs verver were making the occasion easy they were somehow conjoined in it conjoined for a present effect as maggie had absolutely never yet seen them and there occurred before long a moment in which amerigo s look met her own in recognitions that he couldn t suppress the question of the amount of correction to which charlotte had laid herself open rose and hovered for the instant only to sink conspicuously by its own weight so high a pitch she seemed to give to the unconsciousness of questions so resplendent a show of serenity she succeeded in making the shade of the official in her beauty and security never for a moment dropped it was a cool high refuge like the deep arched recess of some coloured and gilded image in which she sat and smiled and waited drank her tea referred to her husband and remembered her mission her mission had quite taken form it was but another name for the interest of her great opportunity that of representing the arts and the graces to a people languishing afar off in ignorance maggie had sufficiently intimated to the prince ten minutes before that she needed no showing as to what their friend wouldn t consent to be taken for but the difficulty now indeed was to choose for explicit tribute of admiration between the varieties of her nobler aspects she carried it off to put the matter coarsely with a taste and a discretion that held our young woman s attention for the first quarter of an hour to the very point of diverting it from the attitude of her overshadowed her almost superseded companion but adam verver profited indeed at this time even with his daughter by his so marked peculiarity of seeming on no occasion to have an attitude and so long as they were in the room together she felt him still simply weave his web and play out his long fine cord knew herself in presence of this tacit process very much as she had known herself at fawns he had a way the dear man wherever he was of moving about the room noiselessly to see what it might contain and his manner of now resorting to this habit acquainted as he already was with the objects in view expressed with a certain sharpness the intention of leaving his wife to her devices it did even more than this it signified to the apprehension of the princess from the moment she more directly took thought of him almost a special view of these devices as actually exhibited in their rarity together with an independent a settled appreciation of their general handsome adequacy which scarcely required the accompaniment of his faint contemplative hum charlotte throned as who should say between her hostess and her host the whole scene having crystallised as soon as she took her place to the right quiet lustre the harmony was not less sustained for being superficial and the only approach to a break in it was while amerigo remained standing long enough for his father in law vaguely wondering to appeal to him invite or address him and then in default of any such word selected for presentation to the other visitor a plate of petits fours maggie watched her husband if it now could be called watching offer this refreshment she noted the consummate way for consummate was the term she privately applied in which charlotte cleared her acceptance cleared her impersonal smile of any betrayal any slightest value of consciousness and then felt the slow surge of a vision that at the end of another minute or two had floated her across the room to where her father stood looking at a picture an early florentine sacred subject that he had given her on her marriage he might have been in silence taking his last leave of it it was a work for which he entertained she knew an unqualified esteem the tenderness represented for her by his sacrifice of such a treasure had become to her sense a part of the whole infusion of the immortal expression the beauty of his sentiment looked out at her always from the beauty of the rest as if the frame made positively a window for his spiritual face she might have said to herself at this moment that in leaving the thing behind him held as in her clasping arms he was doing the most possible toward leaving her a part of his palpable self she put her hand over his shoulder and their eyes were held again together by the abiding felicity they smiled in emulation vaguely as if speech failed them through their having passed too far she would have begun to wonder the next minute if it were reserved to them for the last stage to find their contact like that of old friends reunited too much on the theory of the unchanged subject to shy lapses it s all right eh oh my dear rather he had applied the question to the great fact of the picture as she had spoken for the picture in reply but it was as if their words for an instant afterwards symbolised another truth so that they looked about at everything else to give them this extension she had passed her arm into his and the other objects in the room the other pictures the sofas the chairs the tables the cabinets the important pieces supreme in their way stood out round them consciously for recognition and applause their eyes moved together from piece to piece taking in the whole nobleness quite as if for him to measure the wisdom of old ideas the two noble persons seated in conversation at tea fell thus into the splendid effect and the general harmony mrs verver and the prince fairly placed themselves however unwittingly as high expressions of the kind of human furniture required esthetically by such a scene the fusion of their presence with the decorative elements their contribution to the triumph of selection was complete and admirable though to a lingering view a view more penetrating than the occasion really demanded they also might have figured as concrete attestations of a rare power of purchase there was much indeed in the tone in which adam verver spoke again and who shall say where his thought stopped le compte y est you ve got some good things maggie met it afresh ah don t they look well their companions at the sound of this gave them in a spacious intermission of slow talk an attention all of gravity that was like an ampler submission to the general duty of magnificence sitting as still to be thus appraised as a pair of effigies of the contemporary great on one of the platforms of madame tussaud i m so glad for your last look with which after maggie quite in the air had said it the note was struck indeed the note of that strange accepted finality of relation as from couple to couple which almost escaped an awkwardness only by not attempting a gloss yes this was the wonder that the occasion defied insistence precisely because of the vast quantities with which it dealt so that separation was on a scale beyond any compass of parting to do such an hour justice would have been in some degree to question its grounds which was why they remained in fine the four of them in the upper air united in the firmest abstention from pressure there was no point visibly at which face to face either amerigo or charlotte had pressed and how little she herself was in danger of doing so maggie scarce needed to remember that her father wouldn t by the tip of a toe of that she was equally conscious the only thing was that since he didn t she could but hold her breath for what he would do instead when at the end of three minutes more he had said with an effect of suddenness well mag and the principino it was quite as if that were by contrast the hard the truer voice she glanced at the clock i ordered him for half past five which hasn t yet struck trust him my dear not to fail you oh i don t want him to fail me was mr verver s reply yet uttered in so explicitly jocose a relation to the possibilities of failure that even when just afterwards he wandered in his impatience to one of the long windows and passed out to the balcony she asked herself but for a few seconds if reality should she follow him would overtake or meet her there she followed him of necessity it came absolutely so near to his inviting her by stepping off into temporary detachment to give the others something of the chance that she and her husband had so fantastically discussed beside him then while they hung over the great dull place clear and almost coloured now coloured with the odd sad pictured old fashioned look that empty london streets take on in waning afternoons of the summer s end she felt once more how impossible such a passage would have been to them how it would have torn them to pieces if they had so much as suffered its suppressed relations to peep out of their eyes this danger would doubtless indeed have been more to be reckoned with if the instinct of each she could certainly at least answer for her own had not so successfully acted to trump up other apparent connexions for it connexions as to which they could pretend to be frank you mustn t stay on here you know adam verver said as a result of his unobstructed outlook fawns is all there for you of course to the end of my tenure but fawns so dismantled he added with mild ruefulness fawns with half its contents and half its best things removed won t seem to you i m afraid particularly lively no maggie answered we should miss its best things its best things my dear have certainly been removed to be back there she went on to be back there and she paused for the force of her idea oh to be back there without anything good but she didn t hesitate now she brought her idea forth to be back there without charlotte is more than i think would do and as she smiled at him with it so she saw him the next instant take it take it in a way that helped her smile to pass all for an allusion to what she didn t and couldn t say this quantity was too clear that she couldn t at such an hour be pretending to name to him what it was as he would have said going to be at fawns or anywhere else to want for him that was now and in a manner exaltedly sublimely out of their compass and their question so that what was she doing while they waited for the principino while they left the others together and their tension just sensibly threatened what was she doing but just offer a bold but substantial substitute nothing was stranger moreover under the action of charlotte s presence than the fact of a felt sincerity in her words she felt her sincerity absolutely sound she gave it for all it might mean because charlotte dear you know she said is incomparable it took thirty seconds but she was to know when these were over that she had pronounced one of the happiest words of her life they had turned from the view of the street they leaned together against the balcony rail with the room largely in sight from where they stood but with the prince and mrs verver out of range nothing he could try she immediately saw was to keep his eyes from lighting not even his taking out his cigarette case and saying before he said anything else may i smoke she met it for encouragement with her my dear again and then while he struck his match she had just another minute to be nervous a minute that she made use of however not in the least to falter but to reiterate with a high ring a ring that might for all she cared reach the pair inside father father charlotte s great it was not till after he had begun to smoke that he looked at her charlotte s great they could close upon it such a basis as they might immediately feel it make and so they stood together over it quite gratefully each recording to the other s eyes that it was firm under their feet they had even thus a renewed wait as for proof of it much as if he were letting her see while the minutes lapsed for their concealed companions that this was finally just why but just why you see he presently added how right i was right i mean to do it for you ah rather she murmured with her smile and then as to be herself ideally right i don t see what you would have done without her the point was he returned quietly that i didn t see what you were to do yet it was a risk it was a risk said maggie but i believed in it at least for myself she smiled well now he smoked we see we see i know her better you know her best oh but naturally on which as the warranted truth of it hung in the air the truth warranted as who should say exactly by the present opportunity to pronounce this opportunity created and accepted she found herself lost though with a finer thrill than she had perhaps yet known in the vision of all he might mean the sense of it in her rose higher rose with each moment that he invited her thus to see him linger and when after a little more he had said smoking again and looking up with head thrown back and hands spread on the balcony rail at the grey gaunt front of the house she s beautiful beautiful her sensibility reported to her the shade of a new note it was all she might have wished for it was with a kind of speaking competence the note of possession and control and yet it conveyed to her as nothing till now had done the reality of their parting they were parting in the light of it absolutely on charlotte s value the value that was filling the room out of which they had stepped as if to give it play and with which the prince on his side was perhaps making larger acquaintance if maggie had desired at so late an hour some last conclusive comfortable category to place him in for dismissal she might have found it here in its all coming back to his ability to rest upon high values somehow when all was said and with the memory of her gifts her variety her power so much remained of charlotte s what else had she herself meant three minutes before by speaking of her as great great for the world that was before her that he proposed she should be she was not to be wasted in the application of his plan maggie held to this then that she wasn t to be wasted to let his daughter know it he had sought this brief privacy what a blessing accordingly that she could speak her joy in it his face meanwhile at all events was turned to her and as she met his eyes again her joy went straight it s success father it s success and even this he added as the principino appearing alone deep within piped across an instant greeting even this isn t altogether failure they went in to receive the boy upon whose introduction to the room by miss bogle charlotte and the prince got up seemingly with an impressiveness that had caused miss bogle not to give further effect to her own entrance she had retired but the principino s presence by itself sufficiently broke the tension the subsidence of which in the great room ten minutes later gave to the air something of the quality produced by the cessation of a sustained rattle stillness when the prince and princess returned from attending the visitors to their carriage might have been said to be not so much restored as created so that whatever next took place in it was foredoomed to remarkable salience that would have been the case even with so natural though so futile a movement as maggie s going out to the balcony again to follow with her eyes her father s departure the carriage was out of sight it had taken her too long solemnly to reascend and she looked awhile only at the great grey space on which as on the room still more the shadow of dusk had fallen here at first her husband had not rejoined her he had come up with the boy who clutching his hand abounded as usual in remarks worthy of the family archives but the two appeared then to have proceeded to report to miss bogle it meant something for the princess that her husband had thus got their son out of the way not bringing him back to his mother but everything now as she vaguely moved about struck her as meaning so much that the unheard chorus swelled yet this above all her just being there as she was and waiting for him to come in their freedom to be together there always was the meaning most disengaged she stood in the cool twilight and took in all about her where it lurked her reason for what she had done she knew at last really why and how she had been inspired and guided how she had been persistently able how to her soul all the while it had been for the sake of this end here it was then the moment the golden fruit that had shone from afar only what were these things in the fact for the hand and for the lips when tested when tasted what were they as a reward closer than she had ever been to the measure of her course and the full face of her act she had an instant of the terror that when there has been suspense always precedes on the part of the creature to be paid the certification of the amount amerigo knew it the amount he still held it and the delay in his return making her heart beat too fast to go on was like a sudden blinding light on a wild speculation she had thrown the dice but his hand was over her cast he opened the door however at last he hadn t been away ten minutes and then with her sight of him renewed to intensity she seemed to have a view of the number his presence alone as he paused to look at her somehow made it the highest and even before he had spoken she had begun to be paid in full with that consciousness in fact an extraordinary thing occurred the assurance of her safety so making her terror drop that already within the minute it had been changed to concern for his own anxiety for everything that was deep in his being and everything that was fair in his face so far as seeing that she was paid went he might have been holding out the money bag for her to come and take it but what instantly rose for her between the act and her acceptance was the sense that she must strike him as waiting for a confession this in turn charged her with a new horror if that was her proper payment she would go without money his acknowledgment hung there too monstrously at the expense of charlotte before whose mastery of the greater style she had just been standing dazzled all she now knew accordingly was that she should be ashamed to listen to the uttered word all that is but that she might dispose of it on the spot forever isn t she too splendid she simply said offering it to explain and to finish oh splendid with which he came over to her that s our help you see she added to point further her moral it kept him before her therefore taking in or trying to what she so wonderfully gave he tried too clearly to please her to meet her in her own way but with the result only that close to her her face kept before him his hands holding her shoulders his whole act enclosing her he presently echoed see i see nothing but you and the truth of it had with this force after a moment so strangely lighted his eyes that as for pity and dread of them she buried her own in his breast glasses by henry james chapter i yes indeed i say to myself pen in hand i can keep hold of the thread and let it lead me back to the first impression the little story is all there i can touch it from point to point for the thread as i call it is a row of coloured beads on a string none of the beads are missing at least i think they re not that s exactly what i shall amuse myself with finding out i had been all summer working hard in town and then had gone down to folkestone for a blow art was long i felt and my holiday short my mother was settled at folkestone and i paid her a visit when i could i remember how on this occasion after weeks in my stuffy studio with my nose on my palette i sniffed up the clean salt air and cooled my eyes with the purple sea the place was full of lodgings and the lodgings were at that season full of people people who had nothing to do but to stare at one another on the great flat down there were thousands of little chairs and almost as many little jews and there was music in an open rotunda over which the little jews wagged their big noses we all strolled to and fro and took pennyworths of rest the long level cliff top edged in places with its iron rail might have been the deck of a huge crowded ship there were old folks in bath chairs and there was one dear chair creeping to its last full stop by the side of which i always walked there was in fine weather the coast of france to look at and there were the usual things to say about it there was also in every state of the atmosphere our friend mrs meldrum a subject of remark not less inveterate the widow of an officer in the engineers she had settled like many members of the martial miscellany well within sight of the hereditary enemy who however had left her leisure to form in spite of the difference of their years a close alliance with my mother she was the heartiest the keenest the ugliest of women the least apologetic the least morbid in her misfortune she carried it high aloft with loud sounds and free gestures made it flutter in the breeze as if it had been the flag of her country it consisted mainly of a big red face indescribably out of drawing from which she glared at you through gold rimmed aids to vision optic circles of such diameter and so frequently displaced that some one had vividly spoken of her as flattering her nose against the glass of her spectacles she was extraordinarily near sighted and whatever they did to other objects they magnified immensely the kind eyes behind them blest conveniences they were in their hideous honest strength they showed the good lady everything in the world but her own queerness this element was enhanced by wild braveries of dress reckless charges of colour and stubborn resistances of cut wondrous encounters in which the art of the toilet seemed to lay down its life she had the tread of a grenadier and the voice of an angel in the course of a walk with her the day after my arrival i found myself grabbing her arm with sudden and undue familiarity i had been struck by the beauty of a face that approached us and i was still more affected when i saw the face at the sight of my companion open like a window thrown wide a smile fluttered out of it an brightly as a drapery dropped from a sill a drapery shaken there in the sun by a young lady flanked by two young men a wonderful young lady who as we drew nearer rushed up to mrs meldrum with arms flourished for an embrace my immediate impression of her had been that she was dressed in mourning but during the few moments she stood talking with our friend i made more discoveries the figure from the neck down was meagre the stature insignificant but the desire to please towered high as well as the air of infallibly knowing how and of never never missing it this was a little person whom i would have made a high bid for a good chance to paint the head the features the colour the whole facial oval and radiance had a wonderful purity the deep grey eyes the most agreeable i thought that i had ever seen brushed with a kind of winglike grace every object they encountered their possessor was just back from boulogne where she had spent a week with dear mrs floyd taylor this accounted for the effusiveness of her reunion with dear mrs meldrum her black garments were of the freshest and daintiest she suggested a pink and white wreath at a showy funeral she confounded us for three minutes with her presence she was a beauty of the great conscious public responsible order the young men her companions gazed at her and grinned i could see there were very few moments of the day at which young men these or others would not be so occupied the people who approached took leave of their manners every one seemed to linger and gape when she brought her face close to mrs meldrum s and she appeared to be always bringing it close to somebody s it was a marvel that objects so dissimilar should express the same general identity the unmistakable character of the english gentlewoman mrs meldrum sustained the comparison with her usual courage but i wondered why she didn t introduce me i should have had no objection to the bringing of such a face close to mine however by the time the young lady moved on with her escort she herself bequeathed me a sense that some such rapprochement might still occur was this by reason of the general frequency of encounters at folkestone or by reason of a subtle acknowledgment that she contrived to make of the rights on the part of others that such beauty as hers created i was in a position to answer that question after mrs meldrum had answered a few of mine chapter ii flora saunt the only daughter of an old soldier had lost both her parents her mother within a few months mrs meldrum had known them disapproved of them considerably avoided them she had watched the girl off and on from her early childhood flora just twenty was extraordinarily alone in the world so alone that she had no natural chaperon no one to stay with but a mercenary stranger mrs hammond synge the sister in law of one of the young men i had just seen she had lots of friends but none of them nice she kept picking up impossible people the floyd taylors with whom she had been at boulogne were simply horrid the hammond synges were perhaps not so vulgar but they had no conscience in their dealings with her she knows what i think of them said mrs meldrum and indeed she knows what i think of most things she shares that privilege with most of your friends i replied laughing no doubt but possibly to some of my friends it makes a little difference that girl doesn t care a button she knows best of all what i think of flora saunt and what may your opinion be why that she s not worth troubling about an idiot too abysmal doesn t she care for that just enough as you saw to hug me till i cry out she s too pleased with herself for anything else to matter surely my dear friend i rejoined she has a good deal to be pleased with so every one tells her and so you would have told her if i had given you the chance however that doesn t signify either for her vanity is beyond all making or mending she believes in herself and she s welcome after all poor dear having only herself to look to i ve seldom met a young woman more completely free to be silly she has a clear course she ll make a showy finish well i replied as she probably will reduce many persons to the same degraded state her partaking of it won t stand out so much if you mean that the world s full of twaddlers i quite agree with you cried mrs meldrum trumpeting her laugh half across the channel i had after this to consider a little what she would call my mother s son but i didn t let it prevent me from insisting on her making me acquainted with flora saunt indeed i took the bull by the horns urging that she had drawn the portrait of a nature which common charity now demanded of her to put into relation with a character really fine such a frail creature was just an object of pity this contention on my part had at first of course been jocular but strange to say it was quite the ground i found myself taking with regard to our young lady after i had begun to know her i couldn t have said what i felt about her except that she was undefended from the first of my sitting with her there after dinner under the stars that was a week at folkestone of balmy nights and muffled tides and crowded chairs i became aware both that protection was wholly absent from her life and that she was wholly indifferent to its absence the odd thing was that she was not appealing she was abjectly divinely conceited absurdly fantastically pleased her beauty was as yet all the world to her a world she had plenty to do to live in mrs meldrum told me more about her and there was nothing that as the centre of a group of giggling nudging spectators flora wasn t ready to tell about herself she held her little court in the crowd upon the grass playing her light over jews and gentiles completely at ease in all promiscuities it was an effect of these things that from the very first with every one listening i could mention that my main business with her would be just to have a go at her head and to arrange in that view for an early sitting it would have been as impossible i think to be impertinent to her as it would have been to throw a stone at a plate glass window so any talk that went forward on the basis of her loveliness was the most natural thing in the world and immediately became the most general and sociable it was when i saw all this that i judged how though it was the last thing she asked for what one would ever most have at her service was a curious compassion that sentiment was coloured by the vision of the dire exposure of a being whom vanity had put so off her guard hers was the only vanity i have ever known that made its possessor superlatively soft mrs meldrum s further information contributed moreover to these indulgences her account of the girl s neglected childhood and queer continental relegations with straying squabbling monte carlo haunting parents the more invidious picture above all of her pecuniary arrangement still in force with the hammond synges who really though they never took her out practically she went out alone had their hands half the time in her pocket she had to pay for everything down to her share of the wine bills and the horses fodder down to bertie hammond synge s fare in the underground when he went to the city for her she had been left with just money enough to turn her head and it hadn t even been put in trust nothing prudent or proper had been done with it she could spend her capital and at the rate she was going expensive extravagant and with a swarm of parasites to help it certainly wouldn t last very long couldn t you perhaps take her independent unencumbered as you are i asked of mrs meldrum you re probably with one exception the sanest person she knows and you at least wouldn t scandalously fleece her how do you know what i wouldn t do my humorous friend demanded of course i ve thought how i can help her it has kept me awake at night but doing it s impossible she ll take nothing from me you know what she does she hugs me and runs away she has an instinct about me and feels that i ve one about her and then she dislikes me for another reason that i m not quite clear about but that i m well aware of and that i shall find out some day so far as her settling with me goes it would be impossible moreover here she wants naturally enough a much wider field she must live in london her game is there so she takes the line of adoring me of saying she can never forget that i was devoted to her mother which i wouldn t for the world have been and of giving me a wide berth i think she positively dislikes to look at me it s all right there s no obligation though people in general can t take their eyes off me i see that at this moment i replied but what does it matter where or how for the present she lives she ll marry infallibly marry early and everything then will change whom will she marry my companion gloomily asked any one she likes she s so abnormally pretty that she can do anything she ll fascinate some nabob or some prince she ll fascinate him first and bore him afterwards moreover she s not so pretty as you make her out she hasn t a scrap of a figure no doubt but one doesn t in the least miss it not now said mrs meldrum but one will when she s older and when everything will have to count when she s older she ll count as a princess so it won t matter she has other drawbacks my companion went on those wonderful eyes are good for nothing but to roll about like sugar balls which they greatly resemble in a child s mouth she can t use them use them why she does nothing else to make fools of young men but not to read or write not to do any sort of work she never opens a book and her maid writes her notes you ll say that those who live in glass houses shouldn t throw stones of course i know that if i didn t wear my goggles i shouldn t be good for much do you mean that miss saunt ought to sport such things i exclaimed with more horror than i meant to show i don t prescribe for her i don t know that they re what she requires what s the matter with her eyes i asked after a moment i don t exactly know but i heard from her mother years ago that even as a child they had had for a while to put her into spectacles and that though she hated them and had been in a fury of disgust she would always have to be extremely careful i m sure i hope she is i echoed the hope but i remember well the impression this made upon me my immediate pang of resentment a disgust almost equal to flora s own i felt as if a great rare sapphire had split in my hand chapter iii this conversation occurred the night before i went back to town i settled on the morrow to take a late train so that i had still my morning to spend at folkestone where during the greater part of it i was out with my mother every one in the place was as usual out with some one else and even had i been free to go and take leave of her i should have been sure that flora saunt would not be at home just where she was i presently discovered she was at the far end of the cliff the point at which it overhangs the pretty view of sandgate and hythe her back however was turned to this attraction it rested with the aid of her elbows thrust slightly behind her so that her scanty little shoulders were raised toward her ears on the high rail that inclosed the down two gentlemen stood before her whose faces we couldn t see but who even as observed from the rear were visibly absorbed in the charming figure piece submitted to them i was freshly struck with the fact that this meagre and defective little person with the cock of her hat and the flutter of her crape with her eternal idleness her eternal happiness her absence of moods and mysteries and the pretty presentation of her feet which especially now in the supported slope of her posture occupied with their imperceptibility so much of the foreground i was reminded anew i say how our young lady dazzled by some art that the enumeration of her merits didn t explain and that the mention of her lapses didn t affect where she was amiss nothing counted and where she was right everything did i say she was wanting in mystery but that after all was her secret this happened to be my first chance of introducing her to my mother who had not much left in life but the quiet look from under the hood of her chair at the things which when she should have quitted those she loved she could still trust to make the world good for them i wondered an instant how much she might be moved to trust flora saunt and then while the chair stood still and she waited i went over and asked the girl to come and speak to her in this way i saw that if one of flora s attendants was the inevitable young hammond synge master of ceremonies of her regular court always offering the use of a telescope and accepting that of a cigar the other was a personage i had not yet encountered a small pale youth in showy knickerbockers whose eyebrows and nose and the glued points of whose little moustache were extraordinarily uplifted and sustained i remember taking him at first for a foreigner and for something of a pretender i scarce know why unless because of the motive i felt in the stare he fixed on me when i asked miss saunt to come away he struck me a little as a young man practising the social art of impertinence but it didn t matter for flora came away with alacrity bringing all her prettiness and pleasure and gliding over the grass in that rustle of delicate mourning which made the endless variety of her garments as a painter could take heed strike one always as the same obscure elegance she seated herself on the floor of my mother s chair a little too much on her right instep as i afterwards gathered caressing her still hand smiling up into her cold face commending and approving her without a reserve and without a doubt she told her immediately as if it were something for her to hold on by that she was soon to sit to me for a likeness and these words gave me a chance to enquire if it would be the fate of the picture should i finish it to be presented to the young man in the knickerbockers her lips at this parted in a stare her eyes darkened to the purple of one of the shadow patches on the sea she showed for the passing instant the face of some splendid tragic mask and i remembered for the inconsequence of it what mrs meldrum had said about her sight i had derived from this lady a worrying impulse to catechise her but that didn t seem exactly kind so i substituted another question inquiring who the pretty young man in knickerbockers might happen to be oh a gentleman i met at boulogne he has come over to see me after a moment she added lord iffield i had never heard of lord iffield but her mention of his having been at boulogne helped me to give him a niche mrs meldrum had incidentally thrown a certain light on the manners of mrs floyd taylor flora s recent hostess in that charming town a lady who it appeared had a special vocation for helping rich young men to find a use for their leisure she had always one or other in hand and had apparently on this occasion pointed her lesson at the rare creature on the opposite coast i had a vague idea that boulogne was not a resort of the world s envied at the same time there might very well have been a strong attraction there even for one of the darlings of fortune i could perfectly understand in any case that such a darling should be drawn to folkestone by flora saunt but it was not in truth of these things i was thinking what was uppermost in my mind was a matter which though it had no sort of keeping insisted just then on coming out is it true miss saunt i suddenly demanded that you re so unfortunate as to have had some warning about your beautiful eyes i was startled by the effect of my words the girl threw back her head changing colour from brow to chin true who in the world says so i repented of my question in a flash the way she met it made it seem cruel and i felt my mother look at me in some surprise i took care in answer to flora s challenge not to incriminate mrs meldrum i answered that the rumour had reached me only in the vaguest form and that if i had been moved to put it to the test my very real interest in her must be held responsible her blush died away but a pair of still prettier tears glistened in its track if you ever hear such a thing said again you can say it s a horrid lie i had brought on a commotion deeper than any i was prepared for but it was explained in some degree by the next words she uttered i m happy to say there s nothing the matter with any part of me whatever not the least little thing she spoke with her habitual complacency with triumphant assurance she smiled again and i could see how she wished that she hadn t so taken me up she turned it off with a laugh i ve good eyes good teeth a good digestion and a good temper i m sound of wind and limb nothing could have been more characteristic than her blush and her tears nothing less acceptable to her than to be thought not perfect in every particular she couldn t submit to the imputation of a flaw i expressed my delight in what she told me assuring her i should always do battle for her and as if to rejoin her companions she got up from her place on my mother s toes the young men presented their backs to us they were leaning on the rail of the cliff our incident had produced a certain awkwardness and while i was thinking of what next to say she exclaimed irrelevantly don t you know he ll be lord considine at that moment the youth marked for this high destiny turned round and she spoke to my mother i ll introduce him to you he s awfully nice she beckoned and invited him with her parasol the movement struck me as taking everything for granted i had heard of lord considine and if i had not been able to place lord iffield it was because i didn t know the name of his eldest son the young man took no notice of miss saunt s appeal he only stared a moment and then on her repeating it quietly turned his back she was an odd creature she didn t blush at this she only said to my mother apologetically but with the frankest sweetest amusement you don t mind do you he s a monster of shyness it was as if she were sorry for every one for lord iffield the victim of a complaint so painful and for my mother the subject of a certain slight i m sure i don t want him said my mother but flora added some promise of how she would handle him for his rudeness she would clearly never explain anything by any failure of her own appeal there rolled over me while she took leave of us and floated back to her friends a wave of superstitious dread i seemed somehow to see her go forth to her fate and yet what should fill out this orb of a high destiny if not such beauty and such joy i had a dim idea that lord considine was a great proprietor and though there mingled with it a faint impression that i shouldn t like his son the result of the two images was a whimsical prayer that the girl mightn t miss her possible fortune chapter iv one day in the course of the following june there was ushered into my studio a gentleman whom i had not yet seen but with whom i had been very briefly in correspondence a letter from him had expressed to me some days before his regret on learning that my splendid portrait of miss flora louisa saunt whose full name figured by her own wish in the catalogue of the exhibition of the academy had found a purchaser before the close of the private view he took the liberty of inquiring whether i might have at his service some other memorial of the same lovely head some preliminary sketch some study for the picture i had replied that i had indeed painted miss saunt more than once and that if he were interested in my work i should be happy to show him what i had done mr geoffrey dawling the person thus introduced to me stumbled into my room with awkward movements and equivocal sounds a long lean confused confusing young man with a bad complexion and large protrusive teeth he bore in its most indelible pressure the postmark as it were of oxford and as soon as he opened his mouth i perceived in addition to a remarkable revelation of gums that the text of the queer communication matched the registered envelope he was full of refinements and angles of dreary and distinguished knowledge of his unconscious drollery his dress freely partook it seemed from the gold ring into which his red necktie was passed to the square toe caps of his boots to conform with a high sense of modernness to the fashion before the last there were moments when his overdone urbanity all suggestive stammers and interrogative quavers made him scarcely intelligible but i felt him to be a gentleman and i liked the honesty of his errand and the expression of his good green eyes as a worshipper at the shrine of beauty however he needed explaining especially when i found he had no acquaintance with my brilliant model had on the mere evidence of my picture taken as he said a tremendous fancy to her looks i ought doubtless to have been humiliated by the simplicity of his judgment of them a judgment for which the rendering was lost in the subject quite leaving out the element of art he was like the innocent reader for whom the story is really true and the author a negligible quantity he had come to me only because he wanted to purchase and i remember being so amused at his attitude which i had never seen equally marked in a person of education that i asked him why for the sort of enjoyment he desired it wouldn t be more to the point to deal directly with the lady he stared and blushed at this the idea clearly alarmed him he was an extraordinary case personally so modest that i could see it had never occurred to him he had fallen in love with a painted sign and seemed content just to dream of what it stood for he was the young prince in the legend or the comedy who loses his heart to the miniature of the princess beyond seas until i knew him better this puzzled me much the link was so missing between his sensibility and his type he was of course bewildered by my sketches which implied in the beholder some sense of intention and quality but for one of them a comparative failure he ended by conceiving a preference so arbitrary and so lively that taking no second look at the others he expressed his wish to possess it and fell into the extremity of confusion over the question of price i helped him over that stile and he went off without having asked me a direct question about miss saunt yet with his acquisition under his arm his delicacy was such that he evidently considered his rights to be limited he had acquired none at all in regard to the original of the picture there were others for i was curious about him that i wanted him to feel i conceded i should have been glad of his carrying away a sense of ground acquired for coming back to ensure this i had probably only to invite him and i perfectly recall the impulse that made me forbear it operated suddenly from within while he hung about the door and in spite of the diffident appeal that blinked in his gentle grin if he was smitten with flora s ghost what mightn t be the direct force of the luminary that could cast such a shadow this source of radiance flooding my poor place might very well happen to be present the next time he should turn up the idea was sharp within me that there were relations and complications it was no mission of mine to bring about if they were to develop they should develop in their very own sense let me say at once that they did develop and that i perhaps after all had something to do with it if mr dawling had departed without a fresh appointment he was to reappear six months later under protection no less powerful than that of our young lady herself i had seen her repeatedly for months she had grown to regard my studio as the temple of her beauty this miracle was recorded and celebrated there as nowhere else in other places there was occasional reference to other subjects of remark the degree of her presumption continued to be stupefying there was nothing so extraordinary save the degree in which she never paid for it she was kept innocent that is she was kept safe by her egotism but she was helped also though she had now put off her mourning by the attitude of the lone orphan who had to be a law unto herself it was as a lone orphan that she came and went as a lone orphan that she was the centre of a crush the neglect of the hammond synges gave relief to this character and she made it worth their while to be as every one said too shocking lord iffield had gone to india to shoot tigers but he returned in time for the punctual private view it was he who had snapped up as flora called it the gem of the exhibition my hope for the girl s future had slipped ignominiously off his back but after his purchase of the portrait i tried to cultivate a new faith the girl s own faith was wonderful it couldn t however be contagious too great was the limit of her sense of what painters call values her colours were laid on like blankets on a cold night how indeed could a person speak the truth who was always posturing and bragging she was after all vulgar enough and by the time i had mastered her profile and could almost with my eyes shut do it in a single line i was decidedly tired of its purity which affected me at last as inane one moved with her moreover among phenomena mismated and unrelated nothing in her talk ever matched anything out of it lord iffield was dying of love for her but his family was leading him a life his mother horrid woman had told some one that she would rather he should be swallowed by a tiger than marry a girl not absolutely one of themselves he had given his young friend unmistakable signs but was lying low gaining time it was in his father s power to be both in personal and in pecuniary ways excessively nasty to him his father wouldn t last for ever quite the contrary and he knew how thoroughly in spite of her youth her beauty and the swarm of her admirers some of them positively threatening in their passion he could trust her to hold out there were richer cleverer men there were greater personages too but she liked her little viscount just as he was and liked to think that bullied and persecuted he had her there so gratefully to rest upon she came back to me with tale upon tale and it all might be or mightn t i never met my pretty model in the world she moved it appeared in exalted circles and could only admire in her wealth of illustration the grandeur of her life and the freedom of her hand i had on the first opportunity spoken to her of geoffrey dawling and she had listened to my story so far as she had the art of such patience asking me indeed more questions about him than i could answer then she had capped my anecdote with others much more striking the disclosure of effects produced in the most extraordinary quarters on people who had followed her into railway carriages guards and porters even who had literally stuck there others who had spoken to her in shops and hung about her house door cabmen upon her honour in london who to gaze their fill at her had found excuses to thrust their petrifaction through the very glasses of four wheelers she lost herself in these reminiscences the moral of which was that poor mr dawling was only one of a million when therefore the next autumn she flourished into my studio with her odd companion at her heels her first care was to make clear to me that if he was now in servitude it wasn t because she had run after him dawling explained with a hundred grins that when one wished very much to get anything one usually ended by doing so a proposition which led me wholly to dissent and our young lady to asseverate that she hadn t in the least wished to get mr dawling she mightn t have wished to get him but she wished to show him and i seemed to read that if she could treat him as a trophy her affairs were rather at the ebb true there always hung from her belt a promiscuous fringe of scalps much at any rate would have come and gone since our separation in july she had spent four months abroad where on swiss and italian lakes in german cities in the french capital many accidents might have happened chapter v i had been again with my mother but except mrs meldrum and the gleam of france had not found at folkestone my old resources and pastimes mrs meldrum much edified by my report of the performances as she called them in my studio had told me that to her knowledge flora would soon be on the straw she had cut from her capital such fine fat slices that there was almost nothing more left to swallow perched on her breezy cliff the good lady dazzled me as usual by her universal light she knew so much more about everything and everybody than i could ever squeeze out of my colour tubes she knew that flora was acting on system and absolutely declined to be interfered with her precious reasoning was that her money would last as long as she should need it that a magnificent marriage would crown her charms before she should be really pinched she had a sum put by for a liberal outfit meanwhile the proper use of the rest was to decorate her for the approaches to the altar keep her afloat in the society in which she would most naturally meet her match lord iffield had been seen with her at lucerne at cadenabbia but it was mrs meldrum s conviction that nothing was to be expected of him but the most futile flirtation the girl had a certain hold of him but with a great deal of swagger he hadn t the spirit of a sheep he was in fear of his father and would never commit himself in lord considine s lifetime the most flora might achieve was that he wouldn t marry some one else geoffrey dawling to mrs meldrum s knowledge i had told her of the young man s visit had attached himself on the way back from italy to the hammond synge group my informant was in a position to be definite about this dangler she knew about his people she had heard of him before hadn t he been a friend of one of her nephews at oxford hadn t he spent the christmas holidays precisely three years before at her brother in law s in yorkshire taking that occasion to get himself refused with derision by wilful betty the second daughter of the house her sister who liked the floundering youth had written to her to complain of betty and that the young man should now turn up as an appendage of flora s was one of those oft cited proofs that the world is small and that there are not enough people to go round his father had been something or other in the treasury his grandfather on the mother s side had been something or other in the church he had come into the paternal estate two or three thousand a year in hampshire but he had let the place advantageously and was generous to four plain sisters who lived at bournemouth and adored him the family was hideous all round but the very salt of the earth he was supposed to be unspeakably clever he was fond of london fond of books of intellectual society and of the idea of a political career that such a man should be at the same time fond of flora saunt attested as the phrase in the first volume of gibbon has it the variety of his inclinations i was soon to learn that he was fonder of her than of all the other things together betty one of five and with views above her station was at any rate felt at home to have dished herself by her perversity of course no one had looked at her since and no one would ever look at her again it would be eminently desirable that flora should learn the lesson of betty s fate i was not struck i confess with all this in my mind by any symptom on our young lady s part of that sort of meditation the one moral she saw in anything was that of her incomparable aspect which mr dawling smitten even like the railway porters and the cabmen by the doom dealing gods had followed from london to venice and from venice back to london again i afterwards learned that her version of this episode was profusely inexact his personal acquaintance with her had been determined by an accident remarkable enough i admit in connexion with what had gone before a coincidence at all events superficially striking at munich returning from a tour in the tyrol with two of his sisters he had found himself at the table d hote of his inn opposite to the full presentment of that face of which the mere clumsy copy had made him dream and desire he had been tossed by it to a height so vertiginous as to involve a retreat from the board but the next day he had dropped with a resounding thud at the very feet of his apparition on the following with an equal incoherence a sacrifice even of his bewildered sisters whom he left behind he made an heroic effort to escape by flight from a fate of which he had already felt the cold breath that fate in london very little later drove him straight before it drove him one sunday afternoon in the rain to the door of the hammond synges he marched in other words close up to the cannon that was to blow him to pieces but three weeks when he reappeared to me had elapsed since then yet to vary my metaphor the burden he was to carry for the rest of his days was firmly lashed to his back i don t mean by this that flora had been persuaded to contract her scope i mean that he had been treated to the unconditional snub which as the event was to show couldn t have been bettered as a means of securing him she hadn t calculated but she had said never and that word had made a bed big enough for his long legged patience he became from this moment to my mind the interesting figure in the piece now that he had acted without my aid i was free to show him this and having on his own side something to show me he repeatedly knocked at my door what he brought with him on these occasions was a simplicity so huge that as i turn my ear to the past i seem even now to hear it bumping up and down my stairs that was really what i saw of him in the light of his behaviour he had fallen in love as he might have broken his leg and the fracture was of a sort that would make him permanently lame it was the whole man who limped and lurched with nothing of him left in the same position as before the tremendous cleverness the literary society the political ambition the bournemouth sisters all seemed to flop with his every movement a little nearer to the floor i hadn t had an oxford training and i had never encountered the great man at whose feet poor dawling had most submissively sat and who had addressed him his most destructive sniffs but i remember asking myself how effectively this privilege had supposed itself to prepare him for the career on which my friend appeared now to have embarked i remember too making up my mind about the cleverness which had its uses and i suppose in impenetrable shades even its critics but from which the friction of mere personal intercourse was not the sort of process to extract a revealing spark he accepted without a question both his fever and his chill and the only thing he touched with judgment was this convenience of my friendship he doubtless told me his simple story but the matter comes back in a kind of sense of my being rather the mouthpiece of my having had to put it together for him he took it from me in this form without a groan and i gave it him quite as it came he took it again and again spending his odd half hours with me as if for the very purpose of learning how idiotically he was in love he told me i made him see things to begin with hadn t i first made him see flora saunt i wanted him to give her up and lucidly informed him why on which he never protested nor contradicted never was even so alembicated as to declare just for the sake of the point that he wouldn t he simply and pointlessly didn t and when at the end of three months i asked him what was the use of talking with such a fellow his nearest approach to a justification was to say that what made him want to help her was just the deficiencies i dwelt on i could only reply without gross developments oh if you re as sorry for her as that i too was nearly as sorry for her as that but it only led me to be sorrier still for other victims of this compassion with dawling as with me the compassion was at first in excess of any visible motive so that when eventually the motive was supplied each could to a certain extent compliment the other on the fineness of his foresight after he had begun to haunt my studio miss saunt quite gave it up and i finally learned that she accused me of conspiring with him to put pressure on her to marry him she didn t know i would take it that way else she would never have brought him to see me it was in her view a part of the conspiracy that to show him a kindness i asked him at last to sit to me i dare say moreover she was disgusted to hear that i had ended by attempting almost as many sketches of his beauty as i had attempted of hers what was the value of tributes to beauty by a hand that could so abase itself my relation to poor dawling s want of modelling was simple enough i was really digging in that sandy desert for the buried treasure of his soul chapter vi it befell at this period just before christmas that on my having gone under pressure of the season into a great shop to buy a toy or two my eyes fleeing from superfluity lighted at a distance on the bright concretion of flora saunt an exhibitability that held its own even against the most plausible pinkness of the most developed dolls a huge quarter of the place the biggest bazaar on earth was peopled with these and other effigies and fantasies as well as with purchasers and vendors haggard alike in the blaze of the gas with hesitations i was just about to appeal to flora to avert that stage of my errand when i saw that she was accompanied by a gentleman whose identity though more than a year had elapsed came back to me from the folkestone cliff it had been associated on that scene with showy knickerbockers at present it overflowed more splendidly into a fur trimmed overcoat lord iffield s presence made me waver an instant before crossing over and during that instant flora blank and undistinguishing as if she too were after all weary of alternatives looked straight across at me i was on the point of raising my hat to her when i observed that her face gave no sign i was exactly in the line of her vision but she either didn t see me or didn t recognise me or else had a reason to pretend she didn t was her reason that i had displeased her and that she wished to punish me i had always thought it one of her merits that she wasn t vindictive she at any rate simply looked away and at this moment one of the shop girls who had apparently gone off in search of it bustled up to her with a small mechanical toy it so happened that i followed closely what then took place afterwards recognising that i had been led to do so led even through the crowd to press nearer for the purpose by an impression of which in the act i was not fully conscious flora with the toy in her hand looked round at her companion then seeing his attention had been solicited in another quarter she moved away with the shop girl who had evidently offered to conduct her into the presence of more objects of the same sort when she reached the indicated spot i was in a position still to observe her she had asked some question about the working of the toy and the girl taking it herself began to explain the little secret flora bent her head over it but she clearly didn t understand i saw her in a manner that quickened my curiosity give a glance back at the place from which she had come lord iffield was talking with another young person she satisfied herself of this by the aid of a question addressed to her own attendant she then drew closer to the table near which she stood and turning her back to me bent her head lower over the collection of toys and more particularly over the small object the girl had attempted to explain she took it again and after a moment with her face well averted made an odd motion of her arms and a significant little duck of her head these slight signs singular as it may appear produced in my bosom an agitation so great that i failed to notice lord iffield s whereabouts he had rejoined her he was close upon her before i knew it or before she knew it herself i felt at that instant the strangest of all promptings if it could have operated more rapidly it would have caused me to dash between them in some such manner as to give flora a caution in fact as it was i think i could have done this in time had i not been checked by a curiosity stronger still than my impulse there were three seconds during which i saw the young man and yet let him come on didn t i make the quick calculation that if he didn t catch what flora was doing i too might perhaps not catch it she at any rate herself took the alarm on perceiving her companion s nearness she made still averted another duck of her head and a shuffle of her hands so precipitate that a little tin steamboat she had been holding escaped from them and rattled down to the floor with a sharpness that i hear at this hour lord iffield had already seized her arm with a violent jerk he brought her round toward him then it was that there met my eyes a quite distressing sight this exquisite creature blushing glaring exposed with a pair of big black rimmed eye glasses defacing her by their position crookedly astride of her beautiful nose she made a grab at them with her free hand while i turned confusedly away chapter vii i don t remember how soon it was i spoke to geoffrey dawling his sittings were irregular but it was certainly the very next time he gave me one has any rumour ever reached you of miss saunt s having anything the matter with her eyes he stared with a candour that was a sufficient answer to my question backing it up with a shocked and mystified never then i asked him if he had observed in her any symptom however disguised of embarrassed sight on which after a moment s thought he exclaimed disguised as if my use of that word had vaguely awakened a train she s not a bit myopic he said she doesn t blink or contract her lids i fully recognised this and i mentioned that she altogether denied the impeachment owing it to him moreover to explain the ground of my inquiry i gave him a sketch of the incident that had taken place before me at the shop he knew all about lord iffield that nobleman had figured freely in our conversation as his preferred his injurious rival poor dawling s contention was that if there had been a definite engagement between his lordship and the young lady the sort of thing that was announced in the morning post renunciation and retirement would be comparatively easy to him but that having waited in vain for any such assurance he was entitled to act as if the door were not really closed or were at any rate not cruelly locked he was naturally much struck with my anecdote and still more with my interpretation of it there is something there is something possibly something very grave certainly something that requires she should make use of artificial aids she won t admit it publicly because with her idolatry of her beauty the feeling she is all made up of she sees in such aids nothing but the humiliation and the disfigurement she has used them in secret but that is evidently not enough for the affection she suffers from apparently some definite menace has lately grown much worse she looked straight at me in the shop which was violently lighted without seeing it was i at the same distance at folkestone where as you know i first met her where i heard this mystery hinted at and where she indignantly denied the thing she appeared easily enough to recognise people at present she couldn t really make out anything the shop girl showed her she has successfully concealed from the man i saw her with that she resorts in private to a pince nez and that she does so not only under the strictest orders from her oculist but because literally the poor thing can t accomplish without such help half the business of life iffield however has suspected something and his suspicions whether expressed or kept to himself have put him on the watch i happened to have a glimpse of the movement at which he pounced on her and caught her in the act i had thought it all out my idea explained many things and dawling turned pale as he listened to me was he rough with her he anxiously asked how can i tell what passed between them i fled from the place my companion stared do you mean to say her eyesight s going heaven forbid in that case how could she take life as she does how does she take life that s the question he sat there bewilderedly brooding the tears rose to his lids they reminded me of those i had seen in flora s the day i risked my enquiry the question he had asked was one that to my own satisfaction i was ready to answer but i hesitated to let him hear as yet all that my reflections had suggested i was indeed privately astonished at their ingenuity for the present i only rejoined that it struck me she was playing a particular game at which he went on as if he hadn t heard me suddenly haunted with a fear lost in the dark possibility do you mean there s a danger of anything very bad my dear fellow you must ask her special adviser who in the world is her special adviser i haven t a conception but we mustn t get too excited my impression would be that she has only to observe a few ordinary rules to exercise a little common sense dawling jumped at this i see to stick to the pince nez to follow to the letter her oculist s prescription whatever it is and at whatever cost to her prettiness it s not a thing to be trifled with upon my honour it shan t be he roundly declared and he adjusted himself to his position again as if we had quite settled the business after a considerable interval while i botched away he suddenly said did they make a great difference a great difference those things she had put on oh the glasses in her beauty she looked queer of course but it was partly because one was unaccustomed there are women who look charming in nippers what at any rate if she does look queer she must be mad not to accept that alternative she is mad said geoffrey dawling mad to refuse you i grant besides i went on the pince nez which was a large and peculiar one was all awry she had half pulled it off but it continued to stick and she was crimson she was angry it must have been horrible my companion groaned it was horrible but it s still more horrible to defy all warnings it s still more horrible to be landed in without saying in what i disgustedly shrugged my shoulders after a glance at me dawling jerked round then you do believe that she may be i hesitated the thing would be to make her believe it she only needs a good scare but if that fellow is shocked at the precautions she does take oh who knows i rejoined with small sincerity i don t suppose iffield is absolutely a brute i would take her with leather blinders like a shying mare cried geoffrey dawling i had an impression that iffield wouldn t but i didn t communicate it for i wanted to pacify my friend whom i had discomposed too much for the purposes of my sitting i recollect that i did some good work that morning but it also comes back to me that before we separated he had practically revealed to me that my anecdote connecting itself in his mind with a series of observations at the time unconscious and unregistered had covered with light the subject of our colloquy he had had a formless perception of some secret that drove miss saunt to subterfuges and the more he thought of it the more he guessed this secret to be the practice of making believe she saw when she didn t and of cleverly keeping people from finding out how little she saw when one pieced things together it was astonishing what ground they covered just as he was going away he asked me from what source at folkestone the horrid tale had proceeded when i had given him as i saw no reason not to do the name of mrs meldrum he exclaimed oh i know all about her she s a friend of some friends of mine at this i remembered wilful betty and said to myself that i knew some one who would probably prove more wilful still chapter viii a few days later i again heard dawling on my stairs and even before he passed my threshold i knew he had something to tell i ve been down to folkestone it was necessary i should see her i forget whether he had come straight from the station he was at any rate out of breath with his news which it took me however a minute to apply you mean that you ve been with mrs meldrum yes to ask her what she knows and how she comes to know it it worked upon me awfully i mean what you told me he made a visible effort to seem quieter than he was and it showed me sufficiently that he had not been reassured i laid to comfort him and smiling at a venture a friendly hand on his arm and he dropped into my eyes fixing them an instant a strange distended look which might have expressed the cold clearness of all that was to come i know now he said with an emphasis he rarely used what then did mrs meldrum tell you only one thing that signified for she has no real knowledge but that one thing was everything what is it then why that she can t bear the sight of her his pronouns required some arranging but after i had successfully dealt with them i replied that i was quite aware of miss saunt s trick of turning her back on the good lady of folkestone only what did that prove have you never guessed i guessed as soon as she spoke dawling towered over me in dismal triumph it was the first time in our acquaintance that on any ground of understanding this had occurred but even so remarkable an incident still left me sufficiently at sea to cause him to continue why the effect of those spectacles i seemed to catch the tail of his idea mrs meldrum s they re so awfully ugly and they add so to the dear woman s ugliness this remark began to flash a light and when he quickly added she sees herself she sees her own fate my response was so immediate that i had almost taken the words out of his mouth while i tried to fix this sudden image of flora s face glazed in and cross barred even as mrs meldrum s was glazed and barred he went on to assert that only the horror of that image looming out at herself could be the reason of her avoiding the person who so forced it home the fact he had encountered made everything hideously vivid and more vivid than anything else that just such another pair of goggles was what would have been prescribed to flora i see i see i presently returned what would become of lord iffield if she were suddenly to come out in them what indeed would become of every one what would become of everything this was an enquiry that dawling was evidently unprepared to meet and i completed it by saying at last my dear fellow for that matter what would become of you once more he turned on me his good green eyes oh i shouldn t mind the tone of his words somehow made his ugly face beautiful and i discovered at this moment how much i really liked him none the less at the same time perversely and rudely i felt the droll side of our discussion of such alternatives it made me laugh out and say to him while i laughed you d take her even with those things of mrs meldrum s he remained mournfully grave i could see that he was surprised at my rude mirth but he summoned back a vision of the lady at folkestone and conscientiously replied even with those things of mrs meldrum s i begged him not to resent my laughter which but exposed the fact that we had built a monstrous castle in the air didn t he see on what flimsy ground the structure rested the evidence was preposterously small he believed the worst but we were really uninformed i shall find out the truth he promptly replied how can you if you question her you ll simply drive her to perjure herself wherein after all does it concern you to know the truth it s the girl s own affair then why did you tell me your story i was a trifle embarrassed to warn you off i smiled he took no more notice of these words than presently to remark that lord iffield had no serious intentions very possibly i said but you mustn t speak as if lord iffield and you were her only alternatives dawling thought a moment couldn t something be got out of the people she has consulted she must have been to people how else can she have been condemned condemned to what condemned to perpetual nippers of course she has consulted some of the big specialists but she has done it you may be sure in the most clandestine manner and even if it were supposable that they would tell you anything which i altogether doubt you would have great difficulty in finding out which men they are therefore leave it alone never show her what you suspect i even before he quitted me asked him to promise me this all right i promise but he was gloomy enough he was a lover facing the fact that there was no limit to the deceit his loved one was ready to practise it made so remarkably little difference i could see by what a stretch his passionate pity would from this moment overlook the girl s fatuity and folly she was always accessible to him that i knew for if she had told him he was an idiot to dream she could dream of him she would have rebuked the imputation of having failed to make it clear that she would always be glad to regard him as a friend what were most of her friends what were all of them but repudiated idiots i was perfectly aware that in her conversations and confidences i myself for instance had a niche in the gallery as regards poor dawling i knew how often he still called on the hammond synges it was not there but under the wing of the floyd taylors that her intimacy with lord iffield most flourished at all events when a week after the visit i have just summarised flora s name was one morning brought up to me i jumped at the conclusion that dawling had been with her and even i fear briefly entertained the thought that he had broken his word chapter ix she left me after she had been introduced in no suspense about her present motive she was on the contrary in a visible fever to enlighten me but i promptly learned that for the alarm with which she pitiably panted our young man was not accountable she had but one thought in the world and that thought was for lord iffield i had the strangest saddest scene with her and if it did me no other good it at least made me at last completely understand why insidiously from the first she had struck me as a creature of tragedy in showing me the whole of her folly it lifted the curtain of her misery i don t know how much she meant to tell me when she came i think she had had plans of elaborate misrepresentation at any rate she found it at the end of ten minutes the simplest way to break down and sob to be wretched and true when she had once begun to let herself go the movement took her off her feet the relief of it was like the cessation of a cramp she shared in a word her long secret she shifted her sharp pain she brought i confess tears to my own eyes tears of helpless tenderness for her helpless poverty her visit however was not quite so memorable in itself as in some of its consequences the most immediate of which was that i went that afternoon to see geoffrey dawling who had in those days rooms in welbeck street where i presented myself at an hour late enough to warrant the supposition that he might have come in he had not come in but he was expected and i was invited to enter and wait for him a lady i was informed was already in his sitting room i hesitated a little at a loss it had wildly coursed through my brain that the lady was perhaps flora saunt but when i asked if she were young and remarkably pretty i received so significant a no sir that i risked an advance and after a minute in this manner found myself to my astonishment face to face with mrs meldrum oh you dear thing she exclaimed i m delighted to see you you spare me another compromising demarche but for this i should have called on you also know the worst at once if you see me here it s at least deliberate it s planned plotted shameless i came up on purpose to see him upon my word i m in love with him why if you valued my peace of mind did you let him the other day at folkestone dawn upon my delighted eyes i found myself there in half an hour simply infatuated with him with a perfect sense of everything that can be urged against him i hold him none the less the very pearl of men however i haven t come up to declare my passion i ve come to bring him news that will interest him much more above all i ve come to urge upon him to be careful about flora saunt about what he says and does he must be as still as a mouse she s at last really engaged but it s a tremendous secret i was moved to mirth precisely she wired me this noon and spent another shilling to tell me that not a creature in the world is yet to know it she had better have spent it to tell you that she had just passed an hour with the creature you see before you she has just passed an hour with every one in the place mrs meldrum cried they ve vital reasons she says for it s not coming out for a month then it will be formally announced but meanwhile her rejoicing is wild i daresay mr dawling already knows and as it s nearly seven o clock may have jumped off london bridge but an effect of the talk i had with him the other day was to make me on receipt of my telegram feel it to be my duty to warn him in person against taking action so to call it on the horrid certitude which i could see he carried away with him i had added somehow to that certitude he told me what you had told him you had seen in your shop mrs meldrum i perceived had come to welbeck street on an errand identical with my own a circumstance indicating her rare sagacity inasmuch as her ground for undertaking it was a very different thing from what flora s wonderful visit had made of mine i remarked to her that what i had seen in the shop was sufficiently striking but that i had seen a great deal more that morning in my studio in short i said i ve seen everything she was mystified everything the poor creature is under the darkest of clouds oh she came to triumph but she remained to talk something in the nature of sense she put herself completely in my hands she does me the honour to intimate that of all her friends i m the most disinterested after she had announced to me that lord iffield was utterly committed to her and that for the present i was absolutely the only person in the secret she arrived at her real business she had had a suspicion of me ever since that day at folkestone when i asked her for the truth about her eyes the truth is what you and i both guessed she s in very bad danger but from what cause i who by god s mercy have kept mine know everything that can be known about eyes said mrs meldrum she might have kept hers if she had profited by god s mercy if she had done in time done years ago what was imperatively ordered her if she hadn t in fine been cursed with the loveliness that was to make her behaviour a thing of fable she may still keep her sight or what remains of it if she ll sacrifice and after all so little that purely superficial charm she must do as you ve done she must wear dear lady what you wear what my companion wore glittered for the moment like a melon frame in august heaven forgive her now i understand she flushed for dismay but i wasn t afraid of the effect on her good nature of her thus seeing through her great goggles why it had always been that flora held her at such a distance i can t tell you i said from what special affection what state of the eye her danger proceeds that s the one thing she succeeded this morning in keeping from me she knows it herself perfectly she has had the best advice in europe it s a thing that s awful simply awful that was the only account she would give me year before last while she was at boulogne she went for three days with mrs floyd taylor to paris she there surreptitiously consulted the greatest man even mrs floyd taylor doesn t know last autumn in germany she did the same first put on certain special spectacles with a straight bar in the middle then we ll talk that s practically what they say what she says is that she ll put on anything in nature when she s married but that she must get married first she has always meant to do everything as soon as she s married then and then only she ll be safe how will any one ever look at her if she makes herself a fright how could she ever have got engaged if she had made herself a fright from the first it s no use to insist that with her beauty she can never be a fright she said to me this morning poor girl the most characteristic the most harrowing things my face is all i have and such a face i knew from the first i could do anything with it but i needed it all i need it still every exquisite inch of it it isn t as if i had a figure or anything else oh if god had only given me a figure too i don t say yes with a figure a really good one like fanny floyd taylor s who s hideous i d have risked plain glasses que voulez vous no one is perfect she says she still has money left but i don t believe a word of it she has been speculating on her impunity on the idea that her danger would hold off she has literally been running a race with it her theory has been as you from the first so clearly saw that she d get in ahead she swears to me that though the bar is too cruel she wears when she s alone what she has been ordered to wear but when the deuce is she alone it s herself of course that she has swindled worst she has put herself off so insanely that even her conceit but half accounts for it with little inadequate concessions little false measures and preposterous evasions and childish hopes her great terror is now that iffield who already has suspicions who has found out her pince nez but whom she has beguiled with some unblushing hocus pocus may discover the dreadful facts and the essence of what she wanted this morning was in that interest to square me to get me to deny indignantly and authoritatively for isn t she my favourite sitter that she has anything in life the matter with any part of her she sobbed she went on she entreated after we got talking her extraordinary nerve left her and she showed me what she has been through showed me also all her terror of the harm i could do her wait till i m married wait till i m married she took hold of me she almost sank on her knees it seems to me highly immoral one s participation in her fraud but there s no doubt that she must be married i don t know what i don t see behind it therefore i wound up dawling must keep his hands off mrs meldrum had held her breath she gave out a long moan well that s exactly what i came here to tell him then here he is our host all unprepared his latchkey still in his hand had just pushed open the door and startled at finding us turned a frightened look from one to the other wondering what disaster we were there to announce or avert mrs meldrum was on the spot all gaiety i ve come to return your sweet visit ah she laughed i mean to keep up the acquaintance do do he murmured mechanically and absently continuing to look at us then he broke out he s going to marry her i was surprised you already know he produced an evening paper which he tossed down on the table it s in that published already i was still more surprised oh flora can t keep a secret mrs meldrum made it light she went up to poor dawling and laid a motherly hand upon him it s all right it s just as it ought to be don t think about her ever any more then as he met this adjuration with a stare from which thought and of the most defiant and dismal fairly protruded the excellent woman put up her funny face and tenderly kissed him on the cheek chapter x i have spoken of these reminiscences as of a row of coloured beads and i confess that as i continue to straighten out my chaplet i am rather proud of the comparison the beads are all there as i said they slip along the string in their small smooth roundness geoffrey dawling accepted as a gentleman the event his evening paper had proclaimed in view of which i snatched a moment to nudge him a hint that he might offer mrs meldrum his hand he returned me a heavy head shake and i judged that marriage would henceforth strike him very much as the traffic of the street may strike some poor incurable at the window of an hospital circumstances arising at this time led to my making an absence from england and circumstances already existing offered him a firm basis for similar action he had after all the usual resource of a briton he could take to his boats always drawn up in our background he started on a journey round the globe and i was left with nothing but my inference as to what might have happened later observation however only confirmed my belief that if at any time during the couple of months after flora saunt s brilliant engagement he had made up as they say to the good lady of folkestone that good lady would not have pushed him over the cliff strange as she was to behold i knew of cases in which she had been obliged to administer that shove i went to new york to paint a couple of portraits but i found once on the spot that i had counted without chicago where i was invited to blot out this harsh discrimination by the production of some dozen i spent a year in america and should probably have spent a second had i not been summoned back to england by alarming news from my mother her strength had failed and as soon as i reached london i hurried down to folkestone arriving just at the moment to offer a welcome to some slight symptom of a rally she had been much worse but was now a little better and though i found nothing but satisfaction in having come to her i saw after a few hours that my london studio where arrears of work had already met me would be my place to await whatever might next occur yet before returning to town i called on mrs meldrum from whom i had not had a line and my view of whom with the adjacent objects as i had left them had been intercepted by a luxuriant foreground before i had gained her house i met her as i supposed coming toward me across the down greeting me from afar with the familiar twinkle of her great vitreous badge and as it was late in the autumn and the esplanade a blank i was free to acknowledge this signal by cutting a caper on the grass my enthusiasm dropped indeed the next moment for i had seen in a few more seconds that the person thus assaulted had by no means the figure of my military friend i felt a shock much greater than any i should have thought possible when on this person s drawing near i knew her for poor little flora saunt at what moment she had recognised me belonged to an order of mysteries over which it quickly came home to me one would never linger again once we were face to face it so chiefly mattered that i should succeed in looking entirely unastonished all i at first saw was the big gold bar crossing each of her lenses over which something convex and grotesque like the eyes of a large insect something that now represented her whole personality seemed as out of the orifice of a prison to strain forward and press the face had shrunk away it looked smaller appeared even to look plain it was at all events so far as the effect on a spectator was concerned wholly sacrificed to this huge apparatus of sight there was no smile in it and she made no motion to take my offered hand i had no idea you were down here i said and i wondered whether she didn t know me at all or knew me only by my voice you thought i was mrs meldrum she ever so quietly answered it was just this low pitch that made me protest with laughter oh yes you have a tremendous deal in common with mrs meldrum i ve just returned to england after a long absence and i m on my way to see her won t you come with me it struck me that her old reason for keeping clear of our friend was well disposed of now i ve just left her i m staying with her she stood solemnly fixing me with her goggles would you like to paint me now she asked she seemed to speak with intense gravity from behind a mask or a cage there was nothing to do but treat the question still with high spirits it would be a fascinating little artistic problem that something was wrong it wasn t difficult to see but a good deal more than met the eye might be presumed to be wrong if flora was under mrs meldrum s roof i hadn t for a year had much time to think of her but my imagination had had ground for lodging her in more gilded halls one of the last things i had heard before leaving england was that in commemoration of the new relationship she had gone to stay with lady considine this had made me take everything else for granted and the noisy american world had deafened my care to possible contradictions her spectacles were at present a direct contradiction they seemed a negation not only of new relationships but of every old one as well i remember nevertheless that when after a moment she walked beside me on the grass i found myself nervously hoping she wouldn t as yet at any rate tell me anything very dreadful so that to stave off this danger i harried her with questions about mrs meldrum and without waiting for replies became profuse on the subject of my own doings my companion was finely silent and i felt both as if she were watching my nervousness with a sort of sinister irony and as if i were talking to some different and strange person flora plain and obscure and dumb was no flora at all at mrs meldrum s door she turned off with the observation that as there was certainly a great deal i should have to say to our friend she had better not go in with me i looked at her again i had been keeping my eyes away from her but only to meet her magnified stare i greatly desired in truth to see mrs meldrum alone but there was something so grim in the girl s trouble that i hesitated to fall in with this idea of dropping her yet one couldn t express a compassion without seeming to take for granted more trouble than there actually might have been i reflected that i must really figure to her as a fool which was an entertainment i had never expected to give her it rolled over me there for the first time it has come back to me since that there is wondrously in very deep and even in very foolish misfortune a dignity still finer than in the most inveterate habit of being all right i couldn t have to her the manner of treating it as a mere detail that i was face to face with a part of what at our last meeting we had had such a scene about but while i was trying to think of some manner that i could have she said quite colourlessly though somehow as if she might never see me again good bye i m going to take my walk all alone she looked round the great bleak cliff top with whom should i go besides i like to be alone for the present this gave me the glimmer of a vision that she regarded her disfigurement as temporary and the confidence came to me that she would never for her happiness cease to be a creature of illusions it enabled me to exclaim smiling brightly and feeling indeed idiotic oh i shall see you again but i hope you ll have a very pleasant walk all my walks are pleasant thank you they do me such a lot of good she was as quiet as a mouse and her words seemed to me stupendous in their wisdom i take several a day she continued she might have been an ancient woman responding with humility at the church door to the patronage of the parson the more i take the better i feel i m ordered by the doctors to keep all the while in the air and go in for plenty of exercise it keeps up my general health you know and if that goes on improving as it has lately done everything will soon be all right all that was the matter with me before and always it was too reckless was that i neglected my general health it acts directly on the state of the particular organ so i m going three miles i grinned at her from the doorstep while mrs meldrum s maid stood there to admit me oh i m so glad i said looking at her as she paced away with the pretty flutter she had kept and remembering the day when while she rejoined lord iffield i had indulged in the same observation her air of assurance was on this occasion not less than it had been on that but i recalled that she had then struck me as marching off to her doom was she really now marching away from it chapter xi as soon as i saw mrs meldrum i of course broke out is there anything in it is her general health mrs meldrum checked me with her great amused blare you ve already seen her and she has told you her wondrous tale what s in it is what has been in everything she has ever done the most comical tragical belief in herself she thinks she s doing a cure and what does her husband think her husband what husband hasn t she then married lord iffield vous en etes le cried my hostess why he behaved like a regular beast how should i know you never wrote me mrs meldrum hesitated covering me with what poor flora called the particular organ no i didn t write you i abstained on purpose if i kept quiet i thought you mightn t hear over there what had happened if you should hear i was afraid you would stir up mr dawling stir him up urge him to fly to the rescue write out to him that there was another chance for him i wouldn t have done it i said well mrs meldrum replied it was not my business to give you an opportunity in short you were afraid of it again she hesitated and though it may have been only my fancy i thought she considerably reddened at all events she laughed out then i was afraid of it she very honestly answered but doesn t he know has he given no sign every sign in life he came straight back to her he did everything to get her to listen to him but she hasn t the smallest idea of it has he seen her as she is now i presently and just a trifle awkwardly enquired indeed he has and borne it like a hero he told me all about it how much you ve all been through i found occasion to remark then what has become of him he s at home in hampshire he has got back his old place and i believe by this time his old sisters it s not half a bad little place yet its attractions say nothing to flora oh flora s by no means on her back my fried declared she s not on her back because she s on yours have you got her for the rest of your life once more mrs meldrum genially glared did she tell you how much the hammond synges have kindly left her to live on not quite eighty pounds a year that s a good deal but it won t pay the oculist what was it that at last induced her to submit to him her general collapse after that brute of an iffield s rupture she cried her eyes out she passed through a horror of black darkness then came a gleam of light and the light appears to have broadened she went into goggles as repentant magdalens go into the catholic church in spite of which you don t think she ll be saved she thinks she will that s all i can tell you there s no doubt that when once she brought herself to accept her real remedy as she calls it she began to enjoy a relief that she had never known that feeling very new and in spite of what she pays for it most refreshing has given her something to hold on by begotten in her foolish little mind a belief that as she says she s on the mend and that in the course of time if she leads a tremendously healthy life she ll be able to take off her muzzle and become as dangerous again as ever it keeps her going and what keeps you you re good until the parties begin again oh she doesn t object to me now smiled mrs meldrum i m going to take her abroad we shall be a pretty pair i was struck with this energy and after a moment i enquired the reason of it it s to divert her mind my friend replied reddening again a little i thought we shall go next week i ve only waited to see how your mother would be before starting i expressed to her hereupon my sense of her extraordinary merit and also that of the inconceivability of flora s fancying herself still in a situation not to jump at the chance of marrying a man like dawling she says he s too ugly she says he s too dreary she says in fact he s nobody mrs meldrum pursued she says above all that he s not her own sort she doesn t deny that he s good but she finds him impossibly ridiculous he s quite the last person she would ever dream of i was almost disposed on hearing this to protest that if the girl had so little proper feeling her noble suitor had perhaps served her right but after a while my curiosity as to just how her noble suitor had served her got the better of that emotion and i asked a question or two which led my companion again to apply to him the invidious term i have already quoted what had happened was simply that flora had at the eleventh hour broken down in the attempt to put him off with an uncandid account of her infirmity and that his lordship s interest in her had not been proof against the discovery of the way she had practised on him her dissimulation he was obliged to perceive had been infernally deep the future in short assumed a new complexion for him when looked at through the grim glasses of a bride who as he had said to some one couldn t really when you came to find out see her hand before her face he had conducted himself like any other jockeyed customer he had returned the animal as unsound he had backed out in his own way giving the business by some sharp shuffle such a turn as to make the rupture ostensibly flora s but he had none the less remorselessly and basely backed out he had cared for her lovely face cared for it in the amused and haunted way it had been her poor little delusive gift to make men care and her lovely face damn it with the monstrous gear she had begun to rig upon it was just what had let him in he had in the judgment of his family done everything that could be expected of him he had made mrs meldrum had herself seen the letter a handsome offer of pecuniary compensation oh if flora with her incredible buoyancy was in a manner on her feet again now it was not that she had not for weeks and weeks been prone in the dust strange were the humiliations the forms of anguish it was given some natures to survive that flora had survived was perhaps after all a proof she was reserved for some final mercy but she has been in the abysses at any rate said mrs meldrum and i really don t think i can tell you what pulled her through i think i can tell you i returned what in the world but mrs meldrum at the end of an hour flora had not come in and i was obliged to announce that i should have but time to reach the station where i was to find my luggage in charge of my mother s servant mrs meldrum put before me the question of waiting till a later train so as not to lose our young lady but i confess i gave this alternative a consideration less acute than i pretended somehow i didn t care if i did lose our young lady now that i knew the worst that had befallen her it struck me still less as possible to meet her on the ground of condolence and with the sad appearance she wore to me what other ground was left i lost her but i caught my train in truth she was so changed that one hated to see it and now that she was in charitable hands one didn t feel compelled to make great efforts i had studied her face for a particular beauty i had lived with that beauty and reproduced it but i knew what belonged to my trade well enough to be sure it was gone for ever chapter xii i was soon called back to folkestone but mrs meldrum and her young friend had already left england finding to that end every convenience on the spot and not having had to come up to town my thoughts however were so painfully engaged there that i should in any case have had little attention for them the event occurred that was to bring my series of visits to a close when this high tide had ebbed i returned to america and to my interrupted work which had opened out on such a scale that with a deep plunge into a great chance i was three good years in rising again to the surface there are nymphs and naiads moreover in the american depths they may have had something to do with the duration of my dive i mention them to account for a grave misdemeanor the fact that after the first year i rudely neglected mrs meldrum she had written to me from florence after my mother s death and had mentioned in a postscript that in our young lady s calculations the lowest figures were now italian counts this was a good omen and if in subsequent letters there was no news of a sequel i was content to accept small things and to believe that grave tidings should there be any would come to me in due course the gravity of what might happen to a featherweight became indeed with time and distance less appreciable and i was not without an impression that mrs meldrum whose sense of proportion was not the least of her merits had no idea of boring the world with the ups and downs of her pensioner the poor girl grew dusky and dim a small fitful memory a regret tempered by the comfortable consciousness of how kind mrs meldrum would always be to her i was professionally more preoccupied than i had ever been and i had swarms of pretty faces in my eyes and a chorus of loud tones in my ears geoffrey dawling had on his return to england written me two or three letters his last information had been that he was going into the figures of rural illiteracy i was delighted to receive it and had no doubt that if he should go into figures they would as they are said to be able to prove anything prove at least that my advice was sound and that he had wasted time enough this quickened on my part another hope a hope suggested by some roundabout rumour i forget how it reached me that he was engaged to a girl down in hampshire he turned out not to be but i felt sure that if only he went into figures deep enough he would become among the girls down in hampshire or elsewhere one of those numerous prizes of battle whose defences are practically not on the scale of their provocations i nursed in short the thought that it was probably open to him to develop as one of the types about whom as the years go on superficial critics wonder without relief how they ever succeeded in dragging a bride to the altar he never alluded to flora saunt and there was in his silence about her quite as in mrs meldrum s an element of instinctive tact a brief implication that if you didn t happen to have been in love with her there was nothing to be said within a week after my return to london i went to the opera of which i had always been much of a devotee i arrived too late for the first act of lohengrin but the second was just beginning and i gave myself up to it with no more than a glance at the house when it was over i treated myself with my glass from my place in the stalls to a general survey of the boxes making doubtless on their contents the reflections pointed by comparison that are most familiar to the wanderer restored to london there was the common sprinkling of pretty women but i suddenly noted that one of these was far prettier than the others this lady alone in one of the smaller receptacles of the grand tier and already the aim of fifty tentative glasses which she sustained with admirable serenity this single exquisite figure placed in the quarter furthest removed from my stall was a person i immediately felt to cause one s curiosity to linger dressed in white with diamonds in her hair and pearls on her neck she had a pale radiance of beauty which even at that distance made her a distinguished presence and with the air that easily attaches to lonely loveliness in public places an agreeable mystery a mystery however she remained to me only for a minute after i had levelled my glass at her i feel to this moment the startled thrill the shock almost of joy with which i translated her vague brightness into a resurrection of flora i say a resurrection because to put it crudely i had on that last occasion left our young woman for dead at present perfectly alive again she was altered only as it were by this fact of life a little older a little quieter a little finer and a good deal fairer she was simply transfigured by having recovered sustained by the reflection that even her recovery wouldn t enable her to distinguish me in the crowd i was free to look at her well then it was it came home to me that my vision of her in her great goggles had been cruelly final as her beauty was all there was of her that machinery had extinguished her and so far as i had thought of her in the interval i had thought of her as buried in the tomb her stern specialist had built with the sense that she had escaped from it came a lively wish to return to her and if i didn t straightway leave my place and rush round the theatre and up to her box it was because i was fixed to the spot some moments longer by the simple inability to cease looking at her she had been from the first of my seeing her practically motionless leaning back in her chair with a kind of thoughtful grace and with her eyes vaguely directed as it seemed on me to one of the boxes on my side of the house and consequently over my head and out of my sight the only movement she made for some time was to finger with an ungloved hand and as if with the habit of fondness the row of pearls on her neck which my glass showed me to be large and splendid her diamonds and pearls in her solitude mystified me making me as she had had no such brave jewels in the days of the hammond synges wonder what undreamt of improvement had taken place in her fortunes the ghost of a question hovered there a moment could anything so prodigious have happened as that on her tested and proved amendment lord iffield had taken her back this could scarce have without my hearing of it and moreover if she had become a person of such fashion where was the little court one would naturally see at her elbow her isolation was puzzling though it could easily suggest that she was but momentarily alone if she had come with mrs meldrum that lady would have taken advantage of the interval to pay a visit to some other box doubtless the box at which flora had just been looking mrs meldrum didn t account for the jewels but the revival of flora s beauty accounted for anything she presently moved her eyes over the house and i felt them brush me again like the wings of a dove i don t know what quick pleasure flickered into the hope that she would at last see me she did see me she suddenly bent forward to take up the little double barrelled ivory glass that rested on the edge of the box and to all appearance fix me with it i smiled from my place straight up at the searching lenses and after an instant she dropped them and smiled as straight back at me oh her smile it was her old smile her young smile her very own smile made perfect i instantly left my stall and hurried off for a nearer view of it quite flushed i remember as i went with the annoyance of having happened to think of the idiotic way i had tried to paint her poor iffield with his sample of that error and still poorer dawling in particular with his i hadn t touched her i was professionally humiliated and as the attendant in the lobby opened her box for me i felt that the very first thing i should have to say to her would be that she must absolutely sit to me again chapter xiii she gave me the smile once more as over her shoulder from her chair she turned her face to me here you are again she exclaimed with her disgloved hand put up a little backward for me to take i dropped into a chair just behind her and having taken it and noted that one of the curtains of the box would make the demonstration sufficiently private bent my lips over it and impressed them on its finger tips it was given me however to my astonishment to feel next that all the privacy in the world couldn t have sufficed to mitigate the start with which she greeted this free application of my moustache the blood had jumped to her face she quickly recovered her hand and jerked at me twisting herself round a vacant challenging stare during the next few instants several extraordinary things happened the first of which was that now i was close to them the eyes of loveliness i had come up to look into didn t show at all the conscious light i had just been pleased to see them flash across the house they showed on the contrary to my confusion a strange sweet blankness an expression i failed to give a meaning to until without delay i felt on my arm directed to it as if instantly to efface the effect of her start the grasp of the hand she had impulsively snatched from me it was the irrepressible question in this grasp that stopped on my lips all sound of salutation she had mistaken my entrance for that of another person a pair of lips without a moustache she was feeling me to see who i was with the perception of this and of her not seeing me i sat gaping at her and at the wild word that didn t come the right word to express or to disguise my dismay what was the right word to commemorate one s sudden discovery at the very moment too at which one had been most encouraged to count on better things that one s dear old friend had gone blind before the answer to this question dropped upon me and the moving moments though few seemed many i heard with the sound of voices the click of the attendant s key on the other side of the door poor flora heard also and on hearing still with her hand on my arm brightened again as i had a minute since seen her brighten across the house she had the sense of the return of the person she had taken me for the person with the right pair of lips as to whom i was for that matter much more in the dark than she i gasped but my word had come if she had lost her sight it was in this very loss that she had found again her beauty i managed to speak while we were still alone before her companion had appeared you re lovelier at this day than you have ever been in your life at the sound of my voice and that of the opening of the door her impatience broke into audible joy she sprang up recognising me always holding me and gleefully cried to a gentleman who was arrested in the doorway by the sight of me he has come back he has come back and you should have heard what he says of me the gentleman was geoffrey dawling and i thought it best to let him hear on the spot how beautiful she is my dear man but how extraordinarily beautiful more beautiful at this hour than ever ever before it gave them almost equal pleasure and made dawling blush to his eyes while this in turn produced in spite of deepened astonishment a blest snap of the strain i had been struggling with i wanted to embrace them both and while the opening bars of another scene rose from the orchestra i almost did embrace dawling whose first emotion on beholding me had visibly and ever so oddly been a consciousness of guilt i had caught him somehow in the act though that was as yet all i knew but by the time we sank noiselessly into our chairs again for the music was supreme wagner passed first my demonstration ought pretty well to have given him the limit of the criticism he had to fear i myself indeed while the opera blazed was only too afraid he might divine in our silent closeness the very moral of my optimism which was simply the comfort i had gathered from seeing that if our companion s beauty lived again her vanity partook of its life i had hit on the right note that was what eased me off it drew all pain for the next half hour from the sense of the deep darkness in which the stricken woman sat if the music in that darkness happily soared and swelled for her it beat its wings in unison with those of a gratified passion a great deal came and went between us without profaning the occasion so that i could feel at the end of twenty minutes as if i knew almost everything he might in kindness have to tell me knew even why flora while i stared at her from the stalls had misled me by the use of ivory and crystal and by appearing to recognise me and smile she leaned back in her chair in luxurious ease i had from the first become aware that the way she fingered her pearls was a sharp image of the wedded state nothing of old had seemed wanting to her assurance but i hadn t then dreamed of the art with which she would wear that assurance as a married woman she had taken him when everything had failed he had taken her when she herself had done so his embarrassed eyes confessed it all confessed the deep peace he found in it they only didn t tell me why he had not written to me nor clear up as yet a minor obscurity flora after a while again lifted the glass from the ledge of the box and elegantly swept the house with it then by the mere instinct of her grace a motion but half conscious she inclined her head into the void with the sketch of a salute producing i could see a perfect imitation of response to some homage dawling and i looked at each other again the tears came into his eyes she was playing at perfection still and her misfortune only simplified the process i recognised that this was as near as i should ever come certainly as i should come that night to pressing on her misfortune neither of us would name it more than we were doing then and flora would never name it at all little by little i saw that what had occurred was strange as it might appear the best thing for her happiness the question was now only of her beauty and her being seen and marvelled at with dawling to do for her everything in life her activity was limited to that such an activity was all within her scope it asked nothing of her that she couldn t splendidly give as from time to time in our delicate communion she turned her face to me with the parody of a look i lost none of the signs of its strange new glory the expression of the eyes was a rub of pastel from a master s thumb the whole head stamped with a sort of showy suffering had gained a fineness from what she had passed through yes flora was settled for life nothing could hurt her further i foresaw the particular praise she would mostly incur she would be invariably interesting she would charm with her pathos more even than she had charmed with her pleasure for herself above all she was fixed for ever rescued from all change and ransomed from all doubt her old certainties her old vanities were justified and sanctified and in the darkness that had closed upon her one object remained clear that object as unfading as a mosaic mask was fortunately the loveliest she could possibly look upon the greatest blessing of all was of course that dawling thought so her future was ruled with the straightest line and so for that matter was his there were two facts to which before i left my friends i gave time to sink into my spirit one was that he had changed by some process as effective as flora s change had been simplified somehow into service as she had been simplified into success he was such a picture of inspired intervention as i had never yet conceived he would exist henceforth for the sole purpose of rendering unnecessary or rather impossible any reference even on her own part to his wife s infirmity oh yes how little desire he would ever give me to refer to it he principally after a while made me feel and this was my second lesson that good natured as he was my being there to see it all oppressed him so that by the time the act ended i recognised that i too had filled out my hour dawling remembered things i think he caught in my very face the irony of old judgments they made him thresh about in his chair i said to flora as i took leave of her that i would come to see her but i may mention that i never went i d go to morrow if i hear she wants me but what in the world can she ever want as i quitted them i laid my hand on dawling s arm and drew him for a moment into the lobby why did you never write to me of your marriage he smiled uncomfortably showing his long yellow teeth and something more i don t know the whole thing gave me such a tremendous lot to do this was the first dishonest speech i had heard him make he really hadn t written because an idea that i would think him a still bigger fool than before i didn t insist but i tried there in the lobby so far as a pressure of his hand could serve me to give him a notion of what i thought him i can t at any rate make out i said why i didn t hear from mrs meldrum she didn t write to you never a word what has become of her i think she s at folkestone dawling returned but i m sorry to say that practically she has ceased to see us you haven t quarrelled with her how could we think of all we owe her at the time of our marriage and for months before she did everything for us i don t know how we should have managed without her but since then she has never been near us and has given us rather markedly little encouragement to keep up relations with her i was struck with this though of course i admit i am struck with all sorts of things well i said after a moment even if i could imagine a reason for that attitude it wouldn t explain why she shouldn t have taken account of my natural interest just so dawling s face was a windowless wall he could contribute nothing to the mystery and quitting him i carried it away it was not till i went down to ace mrs meldrum that was really dispelled she didn t want to hear of them or to talk of them not a bit and it was just in the same spirit that she hadn t wanted to write of them she had done everything in the world for them but now thank heaven the hard business was over after i had taken this in which i was quick to do we quite avoided the subject she simply couldn t bear it
