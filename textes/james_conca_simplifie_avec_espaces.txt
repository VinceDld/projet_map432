the golden bowl volume ihenry james book first the princepart firstithe prince had always liked his london when it had come to him he was one of the modern romans who find by the thames a moreconvincing image of the truth of the ancient state than any theyhave left by the tiber brought up on the legend of the city towhich the world paid tribute he recognised in the present londonmuch more than in contemporary rome the real dimensions of such acase if it was a question of an imperium he said to himself and if one wished as a roman to recover a little the sense ofthat the place to do so was on london bridge or even on a fineafternoon in may at hyde park corner it was not indeed toeither of those places that these grounds of his predilection after all sufficiently vague had at the moment we are concernedwith him guided his steps he had strayed simply enough intobond street where his imagination working at comparativelyshort range caused him now and then to stop before a window inwhich objects massive and lumpish in silver and gold in theforms to which precious stones contribute or in leather steel brass applied to a hundred uses and abuses were as tumbledtogether as if in the insolence of the empire they had been theloot of far off victories the young man s movements however betrayed no consistency of attention not even for that matter when one of his arrests had proceeded from possibilities in facesshaded as they passed him on the pavement by huge beribbonedhats or more delicately tinted still under the tense silk ofparasols held at perverse angles in waiting victorias and theprince s undirected thought was not a little symptomatic since though the turn of the season had come and the flush of thestreets begun to fade the possibilities of faces on the augustafternoon were still one of the notes of the scene he was toorestless that was the fact for any concentration and the lastidea that would just now have occurred to him in any connectionwas the idea of pursuit he had been pursuing for six months as never in his life before and what had actually unsteadied him as we join him was thesense of how he had been justified capture had crowned thepursuit or success as he would otherwise have put it hadrewarded virtue whereby the consciousness of these things madehim for the hour rather serious than gay a sobriety that mighthave consorted with failure sat in his handsome face constructively regular and grave yet at the same time oddly and as might be functionally almost radiant with its dark blueeyes its dark brown moustache and its expression no more sharply foreign to an english view than to have caused it sometimes tobe observed of him with a shallow felicity that he looked like a refined irishman what had happened was that shortly before atthree o clock his fate had practically been sealed and thateven when one pretended to no quarrel with it the moment hadsomething of the grimness of a crunched key in the strongest lockthat could be made there was nothing to do as yet further butfeel what one had done and our personage felt it while heaimlessly wandered it was already as if he were married sodefinitely had the solicitors at three o clock enabled the dateto be fixed and by so few days was that date now distant hewas to dine at half past eight o clock with the young lady onwhose behalf and on whose father s the london lawyers hadreached an inspired harmony with his own man of business poorcalderoni fresh from rome and now apparently in the wondroussituation of being shown london before promptly leaving itagain by mr verver himself mr verver whose easy way with hismillions had taxed to such small purpose in the arrangements the principle of reciprocity the reciprocity with which theprince was during these minutes most struck was that ofcalderoni s bestowal of his company for a view of the lions ifthere was one thing in the world the young man at this juncture clearly intended it was to be much more decent as a son in lawthan lots of fellows he could think of had shown themselves inthat character he thought of these fellows from whom he was soto differ in english he used mentally the english term todescribe his difference for familiar with the tongue from hisearliest years so that no note of strangeness remained with himeither for lip or for ear he found it convenient in life forthe greatest number of relations he found it convenient oddly even for his relation with himself though not unmindful thatthere might still as time went on be others including a moreintimate degree of that one that would seek possibly withviolence the larger or the finer issue which was it of thevernacular miss verver had told him he spoke english too well it was his only fault and he had not been able to speak worseeven to oblige her when i speak worse you see i speakfrench he had said intimating thus that there werediscriminations doubtless of the invidious kind for which thatlanguage was the most apt the girl had taken this she let himknow as a reflection on her own french which she had always sodreamed of making good of making better to say nothing of hisevident feeling that the idiom supposed a cleverness she was nota person to rise to the prince s answer to such remarks genial charming like every answer the parties to his new arrangementhad yet had from him was that he was practising his american inorder to converse properly on equal terms as it were with mr verver his prospective father in law had a command of it hesaid that put him at a disadvantage in any discussion besideswhich well besides which he had made to the girl theobservation that positively of all his observations yet hadmost finely touched her you know i think he s a real galantuomo and no mistake thereare plenty of sham ones about he seems to me simply the best mani ve ever seen in my life well my dear why shouldn t he be the girl had gailyinquired it was this precisely that had set the prince to think thethings or many of them that had made mr verver what he wasseemed practically to bring a charge of waste against the otherthings that with the other people known to the young man hadfailed of such a result why his form he had returned might have made one doubt father s form she hadn t seen it it strikes me he hasn t gotany he hasn t got mine he hasn t even got yours thank you for even the girl had laughed at him oh yours my dear is tremendous but your father has his own i ve madethat out so don t doubt it it s where it has brought him out that s the point it s his goodness that has brought him out our young womanhad at this objected ah darling goodness i think never brought anyone out goodness when it s real precisely rather keeps people in hehad been interested in his discrimination which amused him no it s his way it belongs to him but she had wondered still it s the american way that s all exactly it s all it s all i say it fits him so it must begood for something do you think it would be good for you maggie verver hadsmilingly asked to which his reply had been just of the happiest i don t feel my dear if you really want to know that anything much can noweither hurt me or help me such as i am but you ll see foryourself say however i am a galantuomo which i devoutly hope i m like a chicken at best chopped up and smothered in sauce cooked down as a creme de volaille with half the parts left out your father s the natural fowl running about the bassecour hisfeathers movements his sounds those are the parts that withme are left out all as a matter of course since you can t eat a chickenalive the prince had not been annoyed at this but he had beenpositive well i m eating your father alive which is the onlyway to taste him i want to continue and as it s when he talksamerican that he is most alive so i must also cultivate it toget my pleasure he couldn t make one like him so much in anyother language it mattered little that the girl had continued to demur it wasthe mere play of her joy i think he could make you like him inchinese it would be an unnecessary trouble what i mean is that he s akind of result of his inevitable tone my liking is accordinglyfor the tone which has made him possible oh you ll hear enough of it she laughed before you ve donewith us only this in truth had made him frown a little what do you mean please by my having done with you why found out about us all there is to find he had been able to take it indeed easily as a joke ah love ibegan with that i know enough i feel never to be surprised it s you yourselves meanwhile he continued who really knownothing there are two parts of me yes he had been moved to goon one is made up of the history the doings the marriages the crimes the follies the boundless betises of other people especially of their infamous waste of money that might have cometo me those things are written literally in rows of volumes inlibraries are as public as they re abominable everybody can getat them and you ve both of you wonderfully looked them in theface but there s another part very much smaller doubtless which such as it is represents my single self the unknown unimportant unimportant unimportant save to you personalquantity about this you ve found out nothing luckily my dear the girl had bravely said for what thenwould become please of the promised occupation of my future the young man remembered even now how extraordinarily clear hecouldn t call it anything else she had looked in herprettiness as she had said it he also remembered what he hadbeen moved to reply the happiest reigns we are taught youknow are the reigns without any history oh i m not afraid of history she had been sure of that callit the bad part if you like yours certainly sticks out of you what was it else maggie verver had also said that made meoriginally think of you it wasn t as i should suppose you musthave seen what you call your unknown quantity your particularself it was the generations behind you the follies and thecrimes the plunder and the waste the wicked pope the monstermost of all whom so many of the volumes in your family libraryare all about if i ve read but two or three yet i shall givemyself up but the more as soon as i have time to the rest where therefore she had put it to him again without yourarchives annals infamies would you have been he recalled what to this he had gravely returned i might havebeen in a somewhat better pecuniary situation but his actualsituation under the head in question positively so littlemattered to them that having by that time lived deep into thesense of his advantage he had kept no impression of the girl srejoinder it had but sweetened the waters in which he nowfloated tinted them as by the action of some essence pouredfrom a gold topped phial for making one s bath aromatic no onebefore him never not even the infamous pope had so sat up tohis neck in such a bath it showed for that matter how littleone of his race could escape after all from history what wasit but history and of their kind very much to have theassurance of the enjoyment of more money than the palace builderhimself could have dreamed of this was the element that borehim up and into which maggie scattered on occasion herexquisite colouring drops they were of the colour of what onearth of what but the extraordinary american good faith theywere of the colour of her innocence and yet at the same time ofher imagination with which their relation his and thesepeople s was all suffused what he had further said on theoccasion of which we thus represent him as catching the echoesfrom his own thoughts while he loitered what he had further saidcame back to him for it had been the voice itself of his luck the soothing sound that was always with him you americans arealmost incredibly romantic of course we are that s just what makes everything so nice forus everything he had wondered well everything that s nice at all the world the beautiful world or everything in it that is beautiful i mean we see somuch he had looked at her a moment and he well knew how she hadstruck him in respect to the beautiful world as one of thebeautiful the most beautiful things but what he had answeredwas you see too much that s what may sometimes make youdifficulties when you don t at least he had amended with afurther thought see too little but he had quite granted thathe knew what she meant and his warning perhaps was needless he had seen the follies of the romantic disposition but thereseemed somehow no follies in theirs nothing one was obliged torecognise but innocent pleasures pleasures without penalties their enjoyment was a tribute to others without being a loss tothemselves only the funny thing he had respectfully submitted was that her father though older and wiser and a man into thebargain was as bad that is as good as herself oh he s better the girl had freely declared that is he sworse his relation to the things he cares for and i think itbeautiful is absolutely romantic so is his whole life overhere it s the most romantic thing i know you mean his idea for his native place yes the collection the museum with which he wishes to endowit and of which he thinks more as you know than of anything inthe world it s the work of his life and the motive of everythinghe does the young man in his actual mood could have smiled again smiled delicately as he had then smiled at her has it been hismotive in letting me have you yes my dear positively or in a manner she had said american city isn t by the way his native town for thoughhe s not old it s a young thing compared with him a youngerone he started there he has a feeling about it and the placehas grown as he says like the programme of a charityperformance you re at any rate a part of his collection shehad explained one of the things that can only be got overhere you re a rarity an object of beauty an object of price you re not perhaps absolutely unique but you re so curious andeminent that there are very few others like you you belong to aclass about which everything is known you re what they call amorceau de musee i see i have the great sign of it he had risked that i costa lot of money i haven t the least idea she had gravely answered what youcost and he had quite adored for the moment her way of sayingit he had felt even for the moment vulgar but he had made thebest of that wouldn t you find out if it were a question ofparting with me my value would in that case be estimated she had looked at him with her charming eyes as if his valuewere well before her yes if you mean that i d pay rather thanlose you and then there came again what this had made him say don t talkabout me it s you who are not of this age you re a creature ofa braver and finer one and the cinquecento at its most goldenhour wouldn t have been ashamed of you it would of me and if ididn t know some of the pieces your father has acquired i shouldrather fear for american city the criticism of experts wouldit at all events be your idea he had then just ruefully asked to send me there for safety well we may have to come to it i ll go anywhere you want we must see first it will be only if we have to come to it there are things she had gone on that father puts away thebigger and more cumbrous of course which he stores has alreadystored in masses here and in paris in italy in spain inwarehouses vaults banks safes wonderful secret places we vebeen like a pair of pirates positively stage pirates the sortwho wink at each other and say ha ha when they come to wheretheir treasure is buried ours is buried pretty well everywhere except what we like to see what we travel with and have aboutus these the smaller pieces are the things we take out andarrange as we can to make the hotels we stay at and the houseswe hire a little less ugly of course it s a danger and we haveto keep watch but father loves a fine piece loves as he says the good of it and it s for the company of some of his thingsthat he s willing to run his risks and we ve had extraordinaryluck maggie had made that point we ve never lost anythingyet and the finest objects are often the smallest values inlots of cases you must know have nothing to do with size butthere s nothing however tiny she had wound up that we vemissed i like the class he had laughed for this in which you placeme i shall be one of the little pieces that you unpack at thehotels or at the worst in the hired houses like this wonderfulone and put out with the family photographs and the newmagazines but it s something not to be so big that i have to beburied oh she had returned you shall not be buried my dear tillyou re dead unless indeed you call it burial to go to americancity before i pronounce i should like to see my tomb so he had had after his fashion the last word in their interchange save forthe result of an observation that had risen to his lips at thebeginning which he had then checked and which now came back tohim good bad or indifferent i hope there s one thing youbelieve about me he had sounded solemn even to himself but she had taken itgaily ah don t fix me down to one i believe things enoughabout you my dear to have a few left if most of them even goto smash i ve taken care of that i ve divided my faith intowater tight compartments we must manage not to sink you do believe i m not a hypocrite you recognise that i don tlie or dissemble or deceive is that water tight the question to which he had given a certain intensity had madeher he remembered stare an instant her colour rising as if ithad sounded to her still stranger than he had intended he hadperceived on the spot that any serious discussion of veracity ofloyalty or rather of the want of them practically took herunprepared as if it were quite new to her he had noticed itbefore it was the english the american sign that duplicity like love had to be joked about it couldn t be gone into so the note of his inquiry was well to call it nothing else premature a mistake worth making however for the almostoverdone drollery in which her answer instinctively soughtrefuge water tight the biggest compartment of all why it s the bestcabin and the main deck and the engine room and the steward spantry it s the ship itself it s the whole line it s thecaptain s table and all one s luggage one s reading for thetrip she had images like that that were drawn from steamersand trains from a familiarity with lines a command of own cars from an experience of continents and seas that he wasunable as yet to emulate from vast modern machineries andfacilities whose acquaintance he had still to make but as towhich it was part of the interest of his situation as it stoodthat he could quite without wincing feel his future likely tobristle with them it was in fact content as he was with his engagement andcharming as he thought his affianced bride his view of thatfurniture that mainly constituted our young man s romance andto an extent that made of his inward state a contrast that he wasintelligent enough to feel he was intelligent enough to feelquite humble to wish not to be in the least hard or voracious not to insist on his own side of the bargain to warn himself inshort against arrogance and greed odd enough of a truth washis sense of this last danger which may illustrate moreover hisgeneral attitude toward dangers from within personally heconsidered he hadn t the vices in question and that wasso much to the good his race on the other hand had had themhandsomely enough and he was somehow full of his race itspresence in him was like the consciousness of some inexpugnablescent in which his clothes his whole person his hands and thehair of his head might have been steeped as in some chemicalbath the effect was nowhere in particular yet he constantlyfelt himself at the mercy of the cause he knew his antenatalhistory knew it in every detail and it was a thing to keepcauses well before him what was his frank judgment of so much ofits ugliness he asked himself but a part of the cultivation ofhumility what was this so important step he had just taken butthe desire for some new history that should so far as possible contradict and even if need be flatly dishonour the old ifwhat had come to him wouldn t do he must make somethingdifferent he perfectly recognised always in his humility thatthe material for the making had to be mr verver s millions there was nothing else for him on earth to make it with he hadtried before had had to look about and see the truth humble ashe was at the same time he was not so humble as if he had knownhimself frivolous or stupid he had an idea which may amuse hishistorian that when you were stupid enough to be mistaken aboutsuch a matter you did know it therefore he wasn t mistaken hisfuture might be might be scientific there was nothing inhimself at all events to prevent it he was allying himself toscience for it was science but the absence of prejudice backedby the presence of money his life would be full of machinery which was the antidote to superstition which was in its turn too much the consequence or at least the exhalation ofarchives he thought of these of his not being at all eventsfutile and of his absolute acceptance of the developments of thecoming age to redress the balance of his being so differentlyconsidered the moments when he most winced were those at whichhe found himself believing that really futility would have beenforgiven him even with it in that absurd view he would havebeen good enough such was the laxity in the ververs of theromantic spirit they didn t indeed poor dears know what inthat line the line of futility the real thing meant he did having seen it having tried it having taken its measure thiswas a memory in fact simply to screen out much as just in frontof him while he walked the iron shutter of a shop closing earlyto the stale summer day rattled down at the turn of some crank there was machinery again just as the plate glass all abouthim was money was power the power of the rich peoples well he was of them now of the rich peoples he was on their side ifit wasn t rather the pleasanter way of putting it that they wereon his something of this sort was in any case the moral and the murmurof his walk it would have been ridiculous such a moral fromsuch a source if it hadn t all somehow fitted to the gravity ofthe hour that gravity the oppression of which i began byrecording another feature was the immediate nearness of thearrival of the contingent from home he was to meet them atcharing cross on the morrow his younger brother who had marriedbefore him but whose wife of hebrew race with a portion thathad gilded the pill was not in a condition to travel his sisterand her husband the most anglicised of milanesi his maternaluncle the most shelved of diplomatists and his roman cousin don ottavio the most disponible of ex deputies and ofrelatives a scant handful of the consanguineous who in spite ofmaggie s plea for hymeneal reserve were to accompany him to thealtar it was no great array yet it was apparently to be a morenumerous muster than any possible to the bride herself havingno wealth of kinship to choose from and making it up on theother hand by loose invitations he had been interested in thegirl s attitude on the matter and had wholly deferred to it giving him as it did a glimpse distinctly pleasing of thekind of ruminations she would in general be governed by whichwere quite such as fell in with his own taste they hadn tnatural relations she and her father she had explained so theywouldn t try to supply the place by artificial by make believeones by any searching of highways and hedges oh yes they hadacquaintances enough but a marriage was an intimate thing youasked acquaintances when you had your kith and kin you askedthem over and above but you didn t ask them alone to cover yournudity and look like what they weren t she knew what she meantand what she liked and he was all ready to take from her finding a good omen in both of the facts he expected her desired her to have character his wife should have it and hewasn t afraid of her having much he had had in his earliertime to deal with plenty of people who had had it notably withthe three four ecclesiastics his great uncle the cardinal above all who had taken a hand and played a part in hiseducation the effect of all of which had never been to upsethim he was thus fairly on the look out for the characteristicin this most intimate as she was to come of his associates he encouraged it when it appeared he felt therefore just at present as if his papers were inorder as if his accounts so balanced as they had never done inhis life before and he might close the portfolio with a snap itwould open again doubtless of itself with the arrival of theromans it would even perhaps open with his dining to night inportland place where mr verver had pitched a tent suggestingthat of alexander furnished with the spoils of darius but whatmeanwhile marked his crisis as i have said was his sense of theimmediate two or three hours he paused on corners at crossings there kept rising for him in waves that consciousness sharp asto its source while vague as to its end which i began byspeaking of the consciousness of an appeal to do something orother before it was too late for himself by any friend to whomhe might have mentioned it the appeal could have been turned tofrank derision for what for whom indeed but himself and thehigh advantages attached was he about to marry anextraordinarily charming girl whose prospects of the solidsort were as guaranteed as her amiability he wasn t to do it assuredly all for her the prince as happened however was sofree to feel and yet not to formulate that there rose before himafter a little definitely the image of a friend whom he hadoften found ironic he withheld the tribute of attention frompassing faces only to let his impulse accumulate youth andbeauty made him scarcely turn but the image of mrs assinghammade him presently stop a hansom her youth her beauty werethings more or less of the past but to find her at home as hepossibly might would be doing what he still had time for would put something of a reason into his restlessness and therebyprobably soothe it to recognise the propriety of this particularpilgrimage she lived far enough off in long cadogan place wasalready in fact to work it off a little a perception of thepropriety of formally thanking her and of timing the act just ashe happened to be doing this he made out as he went wasobviously all that had been the matter with him it was true thathe had mistaken the mood of the moment misread it rather superficially as an impulse to look the other way the other wayfrom where his pledges had accumulated mrs assingham precisely represented embodied his pledges was in herpleasant person the force that had set them successively inmotion she had made his marriage quite as truly as his papalancestor had made his family though he could scarce see what shehad made it for unless because she too was perversely romantic he had neither bribed nor persuaded her had given her nothing scarce even till now articulate thanks so that her profit tothink of it vulgarly must have all had to come from the ververs yet he was far he could still remind himself from supposingthat she had been grossly remunerated he was wholly sure shehadn t for if there were people who took presents and people whodidn t she would be quite on the right side and of the proudclass only then on the other hand her disinterestedness wasrather awful it implied that is such abysses of confidence she was admirably attached to maggie whose possession of such afriend might moreover quite rank as one of her assets but thegreat proof of her affection had been in bringing them with herdesign together meeting him during a winter in rome meetinghim afterwards in paris and liking him as she had in timefrankly let him know from the first she had marked him for heryoung friend s own and had then unmistakably presented him in alight but the interest in maggie that was the point would haveachieved but little without her interest in him on what did thatsentiment unsolicited and unrecompensed rest what good again for it was much like his question about mr verver shouldhe ever have done her the prince s notion of a recompense towomen similar in this to his notion of an appeal was more orless to make love to them now he hadn t as he believed madelove the least little bit to mrs assingham nor did he think shehad for a moment supposed it he liked in these days to markthem off the women to whom he hadn t made love it represented and that was what pleased him in it a different stage ofexistence from the time at which he liked to mark off the womento whom he had neither with all this had mrs assinghamherself been either aggressive or resentful on what occasion ever had she appeared to find him wanting these things themotives of such people were obscure a little alarmingly so they contributed to that element of the impenetrable which aloneslightly qualified his sense of his good fortune he rememberedto have read as a boy a wonderful tale by allan poe hisprospective wife s countryman which was a thing to show by theway what imagination americans could have the story of theshipwrecked gordon pym who drifting in a small boat furthertoward the north pole or was it the south than anyone had everdone found at a given moment before him a thickness of white airthat was like a dazzling curtain of light concealing as darknessconceals yet of the colour of milk or of snow there weremoments when he felt his own boat move upon some such mystery the state of mind of his new friends including mrs assinghamherself had resemblances to a great white curtain he had neverknown curtains but as purple even to blackness but as producingwhere they hung a darkness intended and ominous when they wereso disposed as to shelter surprises the surprises were apt to beshocks shocks however from these quite different depths were not whathe saw reason to apprehend what he rather seemed to himself notyet to have measured was something that seeking a name for it he would have called the quantity of confidence reposed in him he had stood still at many a moment of the previous month withthe thought freshly determined or renewed of the generalexpectation to define it roughly of which he was the subject what was singular was that it seemed not so much an expectationof anything in particular as a large bland blank assumption ofmerits almost beyond notation of essential quality and value itwas as if he had been some old embossed coin of a purity of goldno longer used stamped with glorious arms mediaeval wonderful of which the worth in mere modern change sovereigns and halfcrowns would be great enough but as to which since there werefiner ways of using it such taking to pieces was superfluous that was the image for the security in which it was open to himto rest he was to constitute a possession yet was to escapebeing reduced to his component parts what would this mean butthat practically he was never to be tried or tested what wouldit mean but that if they didn t change him they reallywouldn t know he wouldn t know himself how many pounds shillings and pence he had to give these at any rate for thepresent were unanswerable questions all that was before him wasthat he was invested with attributes he was taken seriously lost there in the white mist was the seriousness in them thatmade them so take him it was even in mrs assingham in spite ofher having as she had frequently shown a more mocking spirit all he could say as yet was that he had done nothing so far asto break any charm what should he do if he were to ask herfrankly this afternoon what was morally speaking behind theirveil it would come to asking what they expected him to do shewould answer him probably oh you know it s what we expect youto be on which he would have no resource but to deny hisknowledge would that break the spell his saying he had no idea what idea in fact could he have he also took himself seriously made a point of it but it wasn t simply a question of fancy andpretension his own estimate he saw ways at one time andanother of dealing with but theirs sooner or later say whatthey might would put him to the practical proof as thepractical proof accordingly would naturally be proportionate tothe cluster of his attributes one arrived at a scale that he wasnot honestly the man to calculate who but a billionaire couldsay what was fair exchange for a billion that measure was theshrouded object but he felt really as his cab stopped incadogan place a little nearer the shroud he promised himself virtually to give the latter a twitch ii they re not good days you know he had said to fanny assinghamafter declaring himself grateful for finding her and then withhis cup of tea putting her in possession of the latest news thedocuments signed an hour ago de part et d autre and thetelegram from his backers who had reached paris the morningbefore and who pausing there a little poor dears seemed tothink the whole thing a tremendous lark we re very simple folk mere country cousins compared with you he had also observed and paris for my sister and her husband is the end of theworld london therefore will be more or less another planet ithas always been as with so many of us quite their mecca butthis is their first real caravan they ve mainly known oldengland as a shop for articles in india rubber and leather inwhich they ve dressed themselves as much as possible which allmeans however that you ll see them all of them wreathed insmiles we must be very easy with them maggie s too wonderful her preparations are on a scale she insists on taking in thesposi and my uncle the others will come to me i ve beenengaging their rooms at the hotel and with all those solemnsignatures of an hour ago that brings the case home to me do you mean you re afraid his hostess had amusedly asked terribly afraid i ve now but to wait to see the monster come they re not good days they re neither one thing nor the other i ve really got nothing yet i ve everything to lose one doesn tknow what still may happen the way she laughed at him was for an instant almost irritating it came out for his fancy from behind the white curtain it wasa sign that is of her deep serenity which worried instead ofsoothing him and to be soothed after all to be tided over inhis mystic impatience to be told what he could understand andbelieve that was what he had come for marriage then saidmrs assingham is what you call the monster i admit it s afearful thing at the best but for heaven s sake if that s whatyou re thinking of don t run away from it ah to run away from it would be to run away from you theprince replied and i ve already told you often enough how idepend on you to see me through he so liked the way she tookthis from the corner of her sofa that he gave his sincerity for it was sincerity fuller expression i m starting on thegreat voyage across the unknown sea my ship s all rigged andappointed the cargo s stowed away and the company complete butwhat seems the matter with me is that i can t sail alone my shipmust be one of a pair must have in the waste of waters a whatdo you call it a consort i don t ask you to stay on board withme but i must keep your sail in sight for orientation i don tin the least myself know i assure you the points of thecompass but with a lead i can perfectly follow you must be mylead how can you be sure she asked where i should take you why from your having brought me safely thus far i should neverhave got here without you you ve provided the ship itself and if you ve not quite seen me aboard you ve attended me ever sokindly to the dock your own vessel is all conveniently in thenext berth and you can t desert me now she showed him again her amusement which struck him even asexcessive as if to his surprise he made her also a littlenervous she treated him in fine as if he were not utteringtruths but making pretty figures for her diversion my vessel dear prince she smiled what vessel in the world have i this little house is all our ship bob s and mine andthankful we are now to have it we ve wandered far living asyou may say from hand to mouth without rest for the soles ofour feet but the time has come for us at last to draw in he made at this the young man an indignant protest you talkabout rest it s too selfish when you re just launching me onadventures she shook her head with her kind lucidity not adventures heaven forbid you ve had yours as i ve had mine and my ideahas been all along that we should neither of us begin again myown last precisely has been doing for you all you so prettilymention but it consists simply in having conducted you to rest you talk about ships but they re not the comparison yourtossings are over you re practically in port the port sheconcluded of the golden isles he looked about to put himself more in relation with the place then after an hesitation seemed to speak certain words insteadof certain others oh i know where i am i do decline to beleft but what i came for of course was to thank you if to dayhas seemed for the first time the end of preliminaries i feelhow little there would have been any at all without you thefirst were wholly yours well said mrs assingham they were remarkably easy i veseen them i ve had them she smiled more difficult everything you must feel went of itself so you must feel everything still goes the prince quickly agreed oh beautifully but you had theconception ah prince so had you he looked at her harder a moment you had it first you had itmost she returned his look as if it had made her wonder i liked it if that s what you mean but you liked it surely yourself iprotest that i had easy work with you i had only at last wheni thought it was time to speak for you all that is quite true but you re leaving me all the same you re leaving me you re washing your hands of me he went on however that won t be easy i won t be left and he had turnedhis eyes about again taking in the pretty room that she had justdescribed as her final refuge the place of peace for a world worn couple to which she had lately retired with bob i shallkeep this spot in sight say what you will i shall need you i mnot you know he declared going to give you up for anybody if you re afraid which of course you re not are you trying tomake me the same she asked after a moment he waited a minute too then answered her with a question yousay you liked it your undertaking to make my engagementpossible it remains beautiful for me that you did it s charmingand unforgettable but still more it s mysterious andwonderful why you dear delightful woman did you like it i scarce know what to make she said of such an inquiry ifyou haven t by this time found out yourself what meaning cananything i say have for you don t you really after all feel she added while nothing came from him aren t you consciousevery minute of the perfection of the creature of whom i ve putyou into possession every minute gratefully conscious but that s exactly theground of my question it wasn t only a matter of your handing meover it was a matter of your handing her it was a matter of herfate still more than of mine you thought all the good of herthat one woman can think of another and yet by your account you enjoyed assisting at her risk she had kept her eyes on him while he spoke and this was what visibly determined a repetition for her are you trying tofrighten me ah that s a foolish view i should be too vulgar youapparently can t understand either my good faith or my humility i m awfully humble the young man insisted that s the way i vebeen feeling to day with everything so finished and ready andyou won t take me for serious she continued to face him as if he really troubled her a little oh you deep old italians there you are he returned it s what i wanted you to come to that s the responsible note yes she went on if you re humble you must be dangerous she had a pause while he only smiled then she said i don t inthe least want to lose sight of you but even if i did ishouldn t think it right thank you for that it s what i needed of you i m sure afterall that the more you re with me the more i shall understand it s the only thing in the world i want i m excellent i reallythink all round except that i m stupid i can do pretty wellanything i see but i ve got to see it first and he pursued hisdemonstration i don t in the least mind its having to be shownme in fact i like that better therefore it is that i want thati shall always want your eyes through them i wish to look evenat any risk of their showing me what i mayn t like for then hewound up i shall know and of that i shall never be afraid she might quite have been waiting to see what he would come to but she spoke with a certain impatience what on earth are youtalking about but he could perfectly say of my real honest fear of being off some day of being wrong without knowing it that s what ishall always trust you for to tell me when i am no with youpeople it s a sense we haven t got it not as you have therefore but he had said enough ecco he simply smiled it was not to be concealed that he worked upon her but of courseshe had always liked him i should be interested she presentlyremarked to see some sense you don t possess well he produced one on the spot the moral dear mrs assingham i mean always as you others consider it i ve ofcourse something that in our poor dear backward old romesufficiently passes for it but it s no more like yours than thetortuous stone staircase half ruined into the bargain in somecastle of our quattrocento is like the lightning elevator inone of mr verver s fifteen storey buildings your moral senseworks by steam it sends you up like a rocket ours is slow andsteep and unlighted with so many of the steps missing that well that it s as short in almost any case to turn round andcome down again trusting mrs assingham smiled to get up some other way yes or not to have to get up at all however he added itold you that at the beginning machiavelli she simply exclaimed you do me too much honour i wish indeed i had his genius however if you really believe i have his perversity you wouldn tsay it but it s all right he gaily enough concluded i shallalways have you to come to on this for a little they sat face to face after which without comment she asked him if he would have more tea all shewould give him he promptly signified and he developed makingher laugh his idea that the tea of the english race was somehowtheir morality made with boiling water in a little pot sothat the more of it one drank the more moral one would become his drollery served as a transition and she put to him severalquestions about his sister and the others questions as to whatbob in particular colonel assingham her husband could do forthe arriving gentlemen whom by the prince s leave he wouldimmediately go to see he was funny while they talked abouthis own people too whom he described with anecdotes of theirhabits imitations of their manners and prophecies of theirconduct as more rococo than anything cadogan place would everhave known this mrs assingham professed was exactly whatwould endear them to her and that in turn drew from hervisitor a fresh declaration of all the comfort of his being ableso to depend on her he had been with her at this point sometwenty minutes but he had paid her much longer visits and hestayed now as if to make his attitude prove his appreciation hestayed moreover that was really the sign of the hour in spiteof the nervous unrest that had brought him and that had in truthmuch rather fed on the scepticism by which she had apparentlymeant to soothe it she had not soothed him and there arrived remarkably a moment when the cause of her failure gleamed out he had not frightened her as she called it he felt that yetshe was herself not at ease she had been nervous though tryingto disguise it the sight of him following on the announcementof his name had shown her as disconcerted this conviction forthe young man deepened and sharpened yet with the effect too of making him glad in spite of it it was as if in calling hehad done even better than he intended for it was somehowimportant that was what it was that there should be at thishour something the matter with mrs assingham with whom in alltheir acquaintance so considerable now there had never been theleast little thing the matter to wait thus and watch for it wasto know of a truth that there was something the matter withhim since strangely with so little to go upon his heart hadpositively begun to beat to the tune of suspense it fairlybefell at last for a climax that they almost ceased topretend to pretend that is to cheat each other with forms theunspoken had come up and there was a crisis neither could havesaid how long it lasted during which they were reduced for allinterchange to looking at each other on quite an inordinatescale they might at this moment in their positively portentousstillness have been keeping it up for a wager sitting for theirphotograph or even enacting a tableau vivant the spectator of whom they would thus well have been worthy mighthave read meanings of his own into the intensity of theircommunion or indeed even without meanings have found hisaccount aesthetically in some gratified play of our modernsense of type so scantly to be distinguished from our modernsense of beauty type was there at the worst in mrs assingham s dark neat head on which the crisp black hair madewaves so fine and so numerous that she looked even more in thefashion of the hour than she desired full of discriminationsagainst the obvious she had yet to accept a flagrant appearanceand to make the best of misleading signs her richness of hue her generous nose her eyebrows marked like those of an actress these things with an added amplitude of person on which middleage had set its seal seemed to present her insistently as adaughter of the south or still more of the east a creatureformed by hammocks and divans fed upon sherbets and waited uponby slaves she looked as if her most active effort might be totake up as she lay back her mandolin or to share a sugaredfruit with a pet gazelle she was in fact however neither apampered jewess nor a lazy creole new york had been recordedly her birthplace and europe punctually her discipline she woreyellow and purple because she thought it better as she said while one was about it to look like the queen of sheba than likea revendeuse she put pearls in her hair and crimson and gold inher tea gown for the same reason it was her theory that natureitself had overdressed her and that her only course was to drown as it was hopeless to try to chasten the overdressing so shewas covered and surrounded with things which were frankly toysand shams a part of the amusement with which she rejoiced tosupply her friends these friends were in the game that ofplaying with the disparity between her aspect and her character her character was attested by the second movement of her face which convinced the beholder that her vision of the humours ofthe world was not supine not passive she enjoyed she neededthe warm air of friendship but the eyes of the american citylooked out somehow for the opportunity of it from under thelids of jerusalem with her false indolence in short her falseleisure her false pearls and palms and courts and fountains shewas a person for whom life was multitudinous detail detail thatleft her as it at any moment found her unappalled andunwearied sophisticated as i may appear it was her frequent phrase shehad found sympathy her best resource it gave her plenty to do it made her as she also said sit up she had in her life twogreat holes to fill and she described herself as dropping socialscraps into them as she had known old ladies in her earlyamerican time drop morsels of silk into the baskets in whichthey collected the material for some eventual patchwork quilt one of these gaps in mrs assingham s completeness was her wantof children the other was her want of wealth it was wonderfulhow little either in the fulness of time came to show sympathyand curiosity could render their objects practically filial justas an english husband who in his military years had run everything in his regiment could make economy blossom like therose colonel bob had a few years after his marriage left thearmy which had clearly by that time done its laudable all forthe enrichment of his personal experience and he could thus givehis whole time to the gardening in question there reigned amongthe younger friends of this couple a legend almost too venerablefor historical criticism that the marriage itself the happiestof its class dated from the far twilight of the age a primitiveperiod when such things such things as american girls acceptedas good enough had not begun to be so that the pleasant pairhad been as to the risk taken on either side bold and original honourably marked for the evening of life as discoverers of akind of hymeneal northwest passage mrs assingham knew better knew there had been no historic hour from that of pocahontasdown when some young englishman hadn t precipitately believedand some american girl hadn t with a few more gradations availed herself to the full of her incapacity to doubt but sheaccepted resignedly the laurel of the founder since she was infact pretty well the doyenne above ground of her transplantedtribe and since above all she had invented combinations though she had not invented bob s own it was he who had donethat absolutely puzzled it out by himself from his first oddglimmer resting upon it moreover through the years to come asproof enough in him by itself of the higher cleverness if shekept her own cleverness up it was largely that he should havefull credit there were moments in truth when she privately felthow little striking out as he had done he could have affordedthat she should show the common limits but mrs assingham scleverness was in truth tested when her present visitor at lastsaid to her i don t think you know that you re treating mequite right you ve something on your mind that you don t tellme it was positive too that her smile in reply was a trifle dim am i obliged to tell you everything i have on my mind it isn t a question of everything but it s a question ofanything that may particularly concern me then you shouldn tkeep it back you know with what care i desire to proceed takingeverything into account and making no mistake that may possiblyinjure her mrs assingham at this had after an instant an oddinterrogation her her and him both our friends either maggie or her father i have something on my mind mrs assingham presently returned something has happened for which i hadn t been prepared but itisn t anything that properly concerns you the prince with immediate gaiety threw back his head what doyou mean by properly i somehow see volumes in it it s the waypeople put a thing when they put it well wrong i put thingsright what is it that has happened for me his hostess the next moment had drawn spirit from his tone oh i shall be delighted if you ll take your share of it charlotte stant is in london she has just been here miss stant oh really the prince expressed clear surprise atransparency through which his eyes met his friend s with acertain hardness of concussion she has arrived from america he then quickly asked she appears to have arrived this noon coming up fromsouthampton at an hotel she dropped upon me after luncheon andwas here for more than an hour the young man heard with interest though not with an interesttoo great for his gaiety you think then i ve a share in it what is my share why any you like the one you seemed just now eager to take itwas you yourself who insisted he looked at her on this with conscious inconsistency and shecould now see that he had changed colour but he was always easy i didn t know then what the matter was you didn t think it could be so bad do you call it very bad the young man asked only shesmiled because that s the way it seems to affect you he hesitated still with the trace of his quickened colour stilllooking at her still adjusting his manner but you allowed youwere upset to the extent yes of not having in the least looked for her any more said mrs assingham than i judge maggie to havedone the prince thought then as if glad to be able to say somethingvery natural and true no quite right maggie hasn t looked forher but i m sure he added she ll be delighted to see her that certainly and his hostess spoke with a different shadeof gravity she ll be quite overjoyed the prince went on has miss stantnow gone to her she has gone back to her hotel to bring her things here ican t have her said mrs assingham alone at an hotel no i see if she s here at all she must stay with me he quite took itin so she s coming now i expect her at any moment if you wait you ll see her oh he promptly declared charming but this word came out asif a little in sudden substitution for some other it soundedaccidental whereas he wished to be firm that accordingly waswhat he next showed himself if it wasn t for what s going onthese next days maggie would certainly want to have her infact he lucidly continued isn t what s happening just areason to make her want to mrs assingham for answer onlylooked at him and this the next instant had apparently hadmore effect than if she had spoken for he asked a question thatseemed incongruous what has she come for it made his companion laugh why for just what you say foryour marriage mine he wondered maggie s it s the same thing it s for your great event andthen said mrs assingham she s so lonely has she given you that as a reason i scarcely remember she gave me so many she abounds poordear in reasons but there s one that whatever she does ialways remember for myself and which is that he looked as if he ought to guess butcouldn t why the fact that she has no home absolutely none whatever she s extraordinarily alone again he took it in and also has no great means very small ones which is not however with the expense ofrailways and hotels a reason for her running to and fro on the contrary but she doesn t like her country hers my dear man it s little enough hers the attribution for the moment amused his hostess she has rebounded now butshe has had little enough else to do with it oh i say hers the prince pleasantly explained very much as at this time of day i might say mine i quite feel i assureyou as if the great place already more or less belonged to me that s your good fortune and your point of view you own or yousoon practically will own so much of it charlotte owns almostnothing in the world she tells me but two colossal trunks onlyone of which i have given her leave to introduce into this house she ll depreciate to you mrs assingham added your property he thought of these things he thought of every thing but he hadalways his resource at hand of turning all to the easy has shecome with designs upon me and then in a moment as if even thiswere almost too grave he sounded the note that had least to dowith himself est elle toujours aussi belle that was thefurthest point somehow to which charlotte stant could berelegated mrs assingham treated it freely just the same the person inthe world to my sense whose looks are most subject toappreciation it s all in the way she affects you one admiresher if one doesn t happen not to so as well one criticisesher ah that s not fair said the prince to criticise her then there you are you re answered i m answered he took it humorously as his lesson sank hisprevious self consciousness with excellent effect in gratefuldocility i only meant that there are perhaps better things tobe done with miss stant than to criticise her when once youbegin that with anyone he was vague and kind i quite agree that it s better to keep out of it as long as onecan but when one must do it yes he asked as she paused then know what you mean i see perhaps he smiled i don t know what i mean well it s what just now in all ways you particularly shouldknow mrs assingham however made no more of this having before anything else apparently a scruple about the tone shehad just used i quite understand of course that given hergreat friendship with maggie she should have wanted to bepresent she has acted impulsively but she has actedgenerously she has acted beautifully said the prince i say generously because i mean she hasn t in any way counted the cost she ll have it to count in a manner now hishostess continued but that doesn t matter he could see how little you ll look after her i ll look after her so it s all right it s all right said mrs assingham then why are youtroubled it pulled her up but only for a minute i m not any more thanyou the prince s dark blue eyes were of the finest and on occasion precisely resembled nothing so much as the high windows of aroman palace of an historic front by one of the great olddesigners thrown open on a feast day to the golden air his lookitself at such times suggested an image that of some verynoble personage who expected acclaimed by the crowd in thestreet and with old precious stuffs falling over the sill for hissupport had gaily and gallantly come to show himself alwaysmoreover less in his own interest than in that of spectators andsubjects whose need to admire even to gape was periodically tobe considered the young man s expression became after thisfashion something vivid and concrete a beautiful personalpresence that of a prince in very truth a ruler warrior patron lighting up brave architecture and diffusing the sense ofa function it had been happily said of his face that the figurethus appearing in the great frame was the ghost of some proudestancestor whoever the ancestor now at all events the princewas for mrs assingham s benefit in view of the people heseemed leaning on crimson damask to take in the bright day helooked younger than his years he was beautiful innocent vague oh well i m not he rang out clear i should like to see you sir she said for you wouldn t havea shadow of excuse he showed how he agreed that he would havebeen at a loss for one and the fact of their serenity was thusmade as important as if some danger of its opposite had directlymenaced them the only thing was that if the evidence of theircheer was so established mrs assingham had a little to explainher original manner and she came to this before they dropped thequestion my first impulse is always to behave abouteverything as if i feared complications but i don t fear them i really like them they re quite my element he deferred for her to this account of herself but still he said if we re not in the presence of a complication she hesitated a handsome clever odd girl staying with one isalways a complication the young man weighed it almost as if the question were new tohim and will she stay very long his friend gave a laugh how in the world can i know i vescarcely asked her ah yes you can t but something in the tone of it amused her afresh do you thinkyou could i he wondered do you think you could get it out of her for me the probablelength of her stay he rose bravely enough to the occasion and the challenge idaresay if you were to give me the chance here it is then for you she answered for she had heard within the minute the stop of a cab at her door she s back iiiit had been said as a joke but as after this they awaitedtheir friend in silence the effect of the silence was to turnthe time to gravity a gravity not dissipated even when theprince next spoke he had been thinking the case over and makingup his mind a handsome clever odd girl staying with one was acomplication mrs assingham so far was right but there werethe facts the good relations from schooldays of the two youngwomen and the clear confidence with which one of them hadarrived she can come you know at any time to us mrs assingham took it up with an irony beyond laughter you dlike her for your honeymoon oh no you must keep her for that but why not after she had looked at him a minute then at the sound of a voice inthe corridor they had got up why not you re splendid charlotte stant the next minute was with them ushered in asshe had alighted from her cab and prepared for not finding mrs assingham alone this would have been to be noticed by thebutler s answer on the stairs to a question put to him shecould have looked at her hostess with such straightness andbrightness only from knowing that the prince was also there thediscrimination of but a moment yet which let him take her instill better than if she had instantly faced him he availedhimself of the chance thus given him for he was conscious of allthese things what he accordingly saw for some seconds withintensity was a tall strong charming girl who wore for him atfirst exactly the look of her adventurous situation asuggestion in all her person in motion and gesture in free vivid yet altogether happy indications of dress from thebecoming compactness of her hat to the shade of tan in her shoes of winds and waves and custom houses of far countries and longjourneys the knowledge of how and where and the habit foundedon experience of not being afraid he was aware at the sametime that of this combination the strongminded note was not as might have been apprehended the basis he was nowsufficiently familiar with english speaking types he had soundedattentively enough such possibilities for a quick vision ofdifferences he had besides his own view of this young lady sstrength of mind it was great he had ground to believe but itwould never interfere with the play of her extremely personal her always amusing taste this last was the thing in her for shethrew it out positively on the spot like a light that shemight have reappeared during these moments just to cool hisworried eyes with he saw her in her light that immediate exclusive address to their friend was like a lamp she was holdingaloft for his benefit and for his pleasure it showed himeverything above all her presence in the world so closely soirretrievably contemporaneous with his own a sharp sharp fact sharper during these instants than any other at all even thanthat of his marriage but accompanied in a subordinate andcontrolled way with those others facial physiognomic thatmrs assingham had been speaking of as subject to appreciation so they were these others as he met them again and that wasthe connection they instantly established with him if they hadto be interpreted this made at least for intimacy there was butone way certainly for him to interpret them in the sense of thealready known making use then of clumsy terms of excess the face was toonarrow and too long the eyes not large and the mouth on theother hand by no means small with substance in its lips and aslight the very slightest tendency to protrusion in the solidteeth otherwise indeed well arrayed and flashingly white but itwas strangely as a cluster of possessions of his own that thesethings in charlotte stant now affected him items in a fulllist items recognised each of them as if for the longinterval they had been stored wrapped up numbered put awayin a cabinet while she faced mrs assingham the door of thecabinet had opened of itself he took the relics out one by one and it was more and more each instant as if she were giving himtime he saw again that her thick hair was vulgarly speaking brown but that there was a shade of tawny autumn leaf in it for appreciation a colour indescribable and of which he had knownno other case something that gave her at moments the sylvanhead of a huntress he saw the sleeves of her jacket drawn to herwrists but he again made out the free arms within them to be ofthe completely rounded the polished slimness that florentinesculptors in the great time had loved and of which theapparent firmness is expressed in their old silver and oldbronze he knew her narrow hands he knew her long fingers andthe shape and colour of her finger nails he knew her specialbeauty of movement and line when she turned her back and theperfect working of all her main attachments that of somewonderful finished instrument something intently made forexhibition for a prize he knew above all the extraordinaryfineness of her flexible waist the stem of an expanded flower which gave her a likeness also to some long loose silk purse well filled with gold pieces but having been passed empty through a finger ring that held it together it was as if beforeshe turned to him he had weighed the whole thing in his openpalm and even heard a little the chink of the metal when shedid turn to him it was to recognise with her eyes what he mighthave been doing she made no circumstance of thus coming uponhim save so far as the intelligence in her face could at anymoment make a circumstance of almost anything if when she movedoff she looked like a huntress she looked when she came nearerlike his notion perhaps not wholly correct of a muse but whatshe said was simply you see you re not rid of me how is dearmaggie it was to come soon enough by the quite unforced operation ofchance the young man s opportunity to ask her the questionsuggested by mrs assingham shortly before her entrance thelicense had he chosen to embrace it was within a few minutesall there the license given him literally to inquire of thisyoung lady how long she was likely to be with them for a matterof the mere domestic order had quickly determined on mrs assingham s part a withdrawal of a few moments which had theeffect of leaving her visitors free mrs betterman s there she had said to charlotte in allusion to some member of thehousehold who was to have received her and seen her belongingssettled to which charlotte had replied that she had encounteredonly the butler who had been quite charming she had deprecatedany action taken on behalf of her effects but her hostess rebounding from accumulated cushions evidently saw more in mrs betterman s non appearance than could meet the casual eye whatshe saw in short demanded her intervention in spite of anearnest let me go from the girl and a prolonged smiling wailover the trouble she was giving the prince was quite aware atthis moment that departure for himself was indicated thequestion of miss stant s installation didn t demand his presence it was a case for one to go away if one hadn t a reason forstaying he had a reason however of that he was equally aware and he had not for a good while done anything more conscious andintentional than not quickly to take leave his visibleinsistence for it came to that even demanded of him a certaindisagreeable effort the sort of effort he had mostly associatedwith acting for an idea his idea was there his idea was to findout something something he wanted much to know and to find itout not tomorrow not at some future time not in short withwaiting and wondering but if possible before quitting the place this particular curiosity moreover confounded itself a littlewith the occasion offered him to satisfy mrs assingham s own hewouldn t have admitted that he was staying to ask a rudequestion there was distinctly nothing rude in his having hisreasons it would be rude for that matter to turn one s back without a word or two on an old friend well as it came to pass he got the word or two for mrs assingham s preoccupation was practically simplifying the littlecrisis was of shorter duration than our account of it duration naturally would have forced him to take up his hat he wassomehow glad on finding himself alone with charlotte that hehad not been guilty of that inconsequence not to be flurried wasthe kind of consistency he wanted just as consistency was thekind of dignity and why couldn t he have dignity when he had somuch of the good conscience as it were on which such advantagesrested he had done nothing he oughtn t he had in fact donenothing at all once more as a man conscious of having knownmany women he could assist as he would have called it at therecurrent the predestined phenomenon the thing always ascertain as sunrise or the coming round of saints days the doingby the woman of the thing that gave her away she did it ever inevitably infallibly she couldn t possibly not do it it washer nature it was her life and the man could always expect itwithout lifting a finger this was his the man s any man s position and strength that he had necessarily the advantage that he only had to wait with a decent patience to be placed in spite of himself it might really be said in the right justso the punctuality of performance on the part of the othercreature was her weakness and her deep misfortune not less nodoubt than her beauty it produced for the man thatextraordinary mixture of pity and profit in which his relationwith her when he was not a mere brute mainly consisted andgave him in fact his most pertinent ground of being always niceto her nice about her nice for her she always dressed her actup of course she muffled and disguised and arranged it showingin fact in these dissimulations a cleverness equal to but onething in the world equal to her abjection she would let it beknown for anything for everything but the truth of which it wasmade that was what precisely charlotte stant would be doingnow that was the present motive and support to a certainty ofeach of her looks and motions she was the twentieth woman shewas possessed by her doom but her doom was also to arrangeappearances and what now concerned him was to learn how sheproposed he would help her would arrange with her to any pointin reason the only thing was to know what appearance could bestbe produced and best be preserved produced and preserved on herpart of course since on his own there had been luckily no follyto cover up nothing but a perfect accord between conduct andobligation they stood there together at all events when the door hadclosed behind their friend with a conscious strained smile andvery much as if each waited for the other to strike the note orgive the pitch the young man held himself in his silentsuspense only not more afraid because he felt her own fear shewas afraid of herself however whereas to his gain of lucidity he was afraid only of her would she throw herself into his arms or would she be otherwise wonderful she would see what he woulddo so their queer minute without words told him and she wouldact accordingly but what could he do but just let her see thathe would make anything everything for her as honourably easyas possible even if she should throw herself into his arms hewould make that easy easy that is to overlook to ignore notto remember and not by the same token either to regret thiswas not what in fact happened though it was also not at a singletouch but by the finest gradations that his tension subsided it s too delightful to be back she said at last and it wasall she definitely gave him being moreover nothing but whatanyone else might have said yet with two or three other thingsthat on his response followed it it quite pointed the path while the tone of it and her whole attitude were as far removedas need have been from the truth of her situation the abjectionthat was present to him as of the essence quite failed to peepout and he soon enough saw that if she was arranging she couldbe trusted to arrange good it was all he asked and all themore that he could admire and like her for it the particular appearance she would as they said go in for wasthat of having no account whatever to give him it would be infact that of having none to give anybody of reasons or ofmotives of comings or of goings she was a charming young womanwho had met him before but she was also a charming young womanwith a life of her own she would take it high up up up everso high well then he would do the same no height would be toogreat for them not even the dizziest conceivable to a youngperson so subtle the dizziest seemed indeed attained when afteranother moment she came as near as she was to come to an apologyfor her abruptness i ve been thinking of maggie and at last i yearned for her iwanted to see her happy and it doesn t strike me i find you tooshy to tell me i shall of course she s happy thank god only it s almost terrible youknow the happiness of young good generous creatures it ratherfrightens one but the blessed virgin and all the saints saidthe prince have her in their keeping certainly they have she s the dearest of the dear but ineedn t tell you the girl added ah he returned with gravity i feel that i ve still much tolearn about her to which he subjoined she ll rejoice awfullyin your being with us oh you don t need me charlotte smiled it s her hour it s agreat hour one has seen often enough with girls what it is but that she said is exactly why why i ve wanted i mean not to miss it he bent on her a kind comprehending face you mustn t missanything he had got it the pitch and he could keep it now for all he had needed was to have it given him the pitch was thehappiness of his wife that was to be the sight of that happinessas a joy for an old friend it was yes magnificent and not theless so for its coming to him suddenly as sincere as noblyexalted something in charlotte s eyes seemed to tell him this seemed to plead with him in advance as to what he was to find init he was eager and he tried to show her that too to find whatshe liked mindful as he easily could be of what the friendshiphad been for maggie it had been armed with the wings of youngimagination young generosity it had been he believed alwayscounting out her intense devotion to her father the liveliestemotion she had known before the dawn of the sentiment inspiredby himself she had not to his knowledge invited the object ofit to their wedding had not thought of proposing to her for amatter of a couple of hours an arduous and expensive journey but she had kept her connected and informed from week to week in spite of preparations and absorptions oh i ve been writingto charlotte i wish you knew her better he could still hear from recent weeks this record of the fact just as he couldstill be conscious not otherwise than queerly of the gratuitouselement in maggie s wish which he had failed as yet to indicateto her older and perhaps more intelligent at any rate whyshouldn t charlotte respond and be quite free to respond tosuch fidelities with something more than mere formal goodmanners the relations of women with each other were of thestrangest it was true and he probably wouldn t have trustedhere a young person of his own race he was proceeding throughouton the ground of the immense difference difficult indeed as itmight have been to disembroil in this young person her race quality nothing in her definitely placed her she was a rare aspecial product her singleness her solitude her want of means that is her want of ramifications and other advantages contributed to enrich her somehow with an odd preciousneutrality to constitute for her so detached yet so aware asort of small social capital it was the only one she had it wasthe only one a lonely gregarious girl could have since few surely had in anything like the same degree arrived at it andsince this one indeed had compassed it but through the play ofsome gift of nature to which you could scarce give a definitename it wasn t a question of her strange sense for tongues with whichshe juggled as a conjuror at a show juggled with balls or hoopsor lighted brands it wasn t at least entirely that for he hadknown people almost as polyglot whom their accomplishment hadquite failed to make interesting he was polyglot himself forthat matter as was the case too with so many of his friends andrelations for none of whom more than for himself was itanything but a common convenience the point was that in thisyoung woman it was a beauty in itself and almost a mystery so certainly he had more than once felt in noting on her lips that rarest among the barbarians of all civil graces a perfectfelicity in the use of italian he had known strangers a few and mostly men who spoke his own language agreeably but he hadknown neither man nor woman who showed for it charlotte s almostmystifying instinct he remembered how from the first of theiracquaintance she had made no display of it quite as if english between them his english so matching with hers were theirinevitable medium he had perceived all by accident by hearingher talk before him to somebody else that they had an alternativeas good an alternative in fact as much better as the amusementfor him was greater in watching her for the slips that nevercame her account of the mystery didn t suffice her recall ofher birth in florence and florentine childhood her parents fromthe great country but themselves already of a corruptgeneration demoralised falsified polyglot well before her with the tuscan balia who was her first remembrance the servantsof the villa the dear contadini of the poder the little girlsand the other peasants of the next podere all the rather shabbybut still ever so pretty human furniture of her early time including the good sisters of the poor convent of the tuscanhills the convent shabbier than almost anything else butprettier too in which she had been kept at school till thesubsequent phase the phase of the much grander institution inparis at which maggie was to arrive terribly frightened and asa smaller girl three years before her own ending of her periodof five such reminiscences naturally gave a ground but theyhad not prevented him from insisting that some strictly civilancestor generations back and from the tuscan hills if shewould made himself felt ineffaceably in her blood and in hertone she knew nothing of the ancestor but she had taken histheory from him gracefully enough as one of the little presentsthat make friendship flourish these matters however all meltedtogether now though a sense of them was doubtless concerned notunnaturally in the next thing of the nature of a surmise thathis discretion let him articulate you haven t i rathergather particularly liked your country they would stick forthe time to their english it doesn t i fear seem particularly mine and it doesn t inthe least matter over there whether one likes it or not thatis to anyone but one s self but i didn t like it saidcharlotte stant that s not encouraging then to me is it the prince went on do you mean because you re going oh yes of course we re going i ve wanted immensely to go she hesitated but now immediately in a month or two it seems to be the new idea on which therewas something in her face as he imagined that made him say didn t maggie write to you not of your going at once but of course you must go and ofcourse you must stay charlotte was easily clear as long aspossible is that what you did he laughed you stayed as long aspossible well it seemed to me so but i hadn t interests you ll havethem on a great scale it s the country for interests saidcharlotte if i had only had a few i doubtless wouldn t haveleft it he waited an instant they were still on their feet yours thenare rather here oh mine the girl smiled they take up little room whereverthey are it determined in him the way this came from her and what itsomehow did for her it determined in him a speech that would haveseemed a few minutes before precarious and in questionable taste the lead she had given him made the difference and he felt it asreally a lift on finding an honest and natural word rise by itslicense to his lips nothing surely could be for both of them more in the note of a high bravery i ve been thinking it allthe while so probable you know that you would have seen yourway to marrying she looked at him an instant and just for these seconds hefeared for what he might have spoiled to marrying whom why some good kind clever rich american again his security hung in the balance then she was as he felt admirable i tried everyone i came across i did my best i showed i hadcome quite publicly for that perhaps i showed it too much atany rate it was no use i had to recognise it no one would haveme then she seemed to show as sorry for his having to hear ofher anything so disconcerting she pitied his feeling about it if he was disappointed she would cheer him up existence youknow all the same doesn t depend on that i mean she smiled on having caught a husband oh existence the prince vaguely commented you think i oughtto argue for more than mere existence she asked i don t seewhy my existence even reduced as much as you like to beingmerely mine should be so impossible there are things of sorts i should be able to have things i should be able to be theposition of a single woman to day is very favourable you know favourable to what why just to existence which may contain after all in one wayand another so much it may contain at the worst evenaffections affections in fact quite particularly fixed thatis on one s friends i m extremely fond of maggie for instance i quite adore her how could i adore her more if i were marriedto one of the people you speak of the prince gave a laugh you might adore him more ah but it isn t is it she asked a question of that my dear friend he returned it s always a question of doingthe best for one s self one can without injury to others hefelt by this time that they were indeed on an excellent basis sohe went on again as if to show frankly his sense of itsfirmness i venture therefore to repeat my hope that you llmarry some capital fellow and also to repeat my belief that sucha marriage will be more favourable to you as you call it thaneven the spirit of the age she looked at him at first only for answer and would haveappeared to take it with meekness had she not perhaps appeared alittle more to take it with gaiety thank you very much shesimply said but at that moment their friend was with them again it was undeniable that as she came in mrs assingham looked with a certain smiling sharpness from one of them to the other the perception of which was perhaps what led charlotte forreassurance to pass the question on the prince hopes so much ishall still marry some good person whether it worked for mrs assingham or not the prince washimself at this more than ever reassured he was safe in aword that was what it all meant and he had required to be safe he was really safe enough for almost any joke it s only heexplained to their hostess because of what miss stant has beentelling me don t we want to keep up her courage if the jokewas broad he had at least not begun it not that is as a joke which was what his companion s address to their friend made ofit she has been trying in america she says but hasn t broughtit off the tone was somehow not what mrs assingham had expected butshe made the best of it well then she replied to the youngman if you take such an interest you must bring it off and you must help dear charlotte said unperturbed as you vehelped so beautifully in such things before with which before mrs assingham could meet the appeal she had addressedherself to the prince on a matter much nearer to him your mar riage is on friday on saturday oh on friday no for what do you take us there s not a vulgaromen we re neglecting on saturday please at the oratory atthree o clock before twelve assistants exactly twelve including me it struck him he laughed you ll make the thirteenth it won tdo not said charlotte if you re going in for omens shouldyou like me to stay away dear no we ll manage we ll make the round number we ll havein some old woman they must keep them there for that don tthey mrs assingham s return had at last indicated for him hisdeparture he had possessed himself again of his hat andapproached her to take leave but he had another word forcharlotte i dine to night with mr verver have you anymessage the girl seemed to wonder a little for mr verver for maggie about her seeing you early that i know is whatshe ll like then i ll come early thanks i daresay he went on she ll send for you i mean send acarriage oh i don t require that thanks i can go for a penny can ti she asked of mrs assingham in an omnibus oh i say said the prince while mrs assingham looked at herblandly yes love and i ll give you the penny she shall get there the good lady added to their friend but charlotte as the latter took leave of her thought ofsomething else there s a great favour prince that i want toask of you i want between this and saturday to make maggie amarriage present oh i say the young man again soothingly exclaimed ah but i must she went on it s really almost for that icame back it was impossible to get in america what i wanted mrs assingham showed anxiety what is it then dear you want but the girl looked only at their companion that s what theprince if he ll be so good must help me to decide can t i mrs assingham asked help you to decide certainly darling we must talk it well over and she kept hereyes on the prince but i want him if he kindly will to go withme to look i want him to judge with me and choose that if youcan spare the hour she said is the great favour i mean he raised his eyebrows at her he wonderfully smiled what youcame back from america to ask ah certainly then i must findthe hour he wonderfully smiled but it was rather more afterall than he had been reckoning with it went somehow so littlewith the rest that directly for him it wasn t the note ofsafety it preserved this character at the best but by beingthe note of publicity quickly quickly however the note ofpublicity struck him as better than any other in another momenteven it seemed positively what he wanted for what so much aspublicity put their relation on the right footing by this appealto mrs assingham it was established as right and sheimmediately showed that such was her own understanding certainly prince she laughed you must find the hour andit was really so express a license from her as representingfriendly judgment public opinion the moral law the marginallowed a husband about to be or whatever that after observingto charlotte that should she come to portland place in the morn ing he would make a point of being there to see her and so easily arrange with her about a time he took his departure withthe absolutely confirmed impression of knowing as he put it tohimself where he was which was what he had prolonged his visitfor he was where he could stay iv i don t quite see my dear colonel assingham said to his wifethe night of charlotte s arrival i don t quite see i m boundto say why you take it even at the worst so ferociously hard it isn t your fault after all is it i ll be hanged at anyrate if it s mine the hour was late and the young lady who had disembarked atsouthampton that morning to come up by the steamer special andwho had then settled herself at an hotel only to re settleherself a couple of hours later at a private house was by thistime they might hope peacefully resting from her exploits there had been two men at dinner rather batteredbrothers in arms of his own period casually picked up by herhost the day before and when the gentlemen after the meal rejoined the ladies in the drawing room charlotte pleadingfatigue had already excused herself the beguiled warriors however had stayed till after eleven mrs assingham thoughfinally quite without illusions as she said about the militarycharacter was always beguiling to old soldiers and as thecolonel had come in before dinner only in time to dress he hadnot till this moment really been summoned to meet his companionover the situation that as he was now to learn their visitor sadvent had created for them it was actually more than midnight the servants had been sent to bed the rattle of the wheels hadceased to come in through a window still open to the august air and robert assingham had been steadily learning all the while what it thus behoved him to know but the words just quoted fromhim presented themselves for the moment as the essence of hisspirit and his attitude he disengaged he would be damned if hedidn t they were both phrases he repeatedly used hisresponsibility the simplest the sanest the most obliging ofmen he habitually indulged in extravagant language his wife hadonce told him in relation to his violence of speech that suchexcesses on his part made her think of a retired general whomshe had once seen playing with toy soldiers fighting and winningbattles carrying on sieges and annihilating enemies with littlefortresses of wood and little armies of tin her husband sexaggerated emphasis was his box of toy soldiers his militarygame it harmlessly gratified in him for his declining years the military instinct bad words when sufficiently numerous andarrayed in their might could represent battalions squadrons tremendous cannonades and glorious charges of cavalry it wasnatural it was delightful the romance and for her as well ofcamp life and of the perpetual booming of guns it was fightingto the end to the death but no one was ever killed less fortunate than she nevertheless in spite of his wealth ofexpression he had not yet found the image that described herfavourite game all he could do was practically to leave it toher emulating her own philosophy he had again and again sat uplate to discuss those situations in which her finer consciousnessabounded but he had never failed to deny that anything in life anything of hers could be a situation for himself she might bein fifty at once if she liked and it was what women did like attheir ease after all there always being when they had too muchof any some man as they were well aware to get them out hewouldn t at any price have one of any sort whatever of hisown or even be in one along with her he watched her accordingly in her favourite element very much as he hadsometimes watched at the aquarium the celebrated lady who in aslight though tight bathing suit turned somersaults and didtricks in the tank of water which looked so cold anduncomfortable to the non amphibious he listened to his companionto night while he smoked his last pipe he watched her throughher demonstration quite as if he had paid a shilling but it wastrue that this being the case he desired the value of hismoney what was it in the name of wonder that she was so benton being responsible for what did she pretend was going tohappen and what at the worst could the poor girl do evengranting she wanted to do anything what at the worst for thatmatter could she be conceived to have in her head if she had told me the moment she got here mrs assinghamreplied i shouldn t have my difficulty in finding out but shewasn t so obliging and i see no sign at all of her becoming so what s certain is that she didn t come for nothing she wants she worked it out at her leisure to see the prince again thatisn t what troubles me i mean that such a fact as a fact isn t but what i ask myself is what does she want it for what s the good of asking yourself if you know you don t know the colonel sat back at his own ease with an ankle resting onthe other knee and his eyes attentive to the good appearance ofan extremely slender foot which he kept jerking in its neatintegument of fine spun black silk and patent leather it seemedto confess this member to consciousness of military discipline everything about it being as polished and perfect as straightand tight and trim as a soldier on parade it went so far as toimply that someone or other would have got something or other confinement to barracks or suppression of pay if it hadn t beenjust as it was bob assingham was distinguished altogether by aleanness of person a leanness quite distinct from physicallaxity which might have been determined on the part of superiorpowers by views of transport and accommodation and which infact verged on the abnormal he did himself as well as hisfriends mostly knew yet remained hungrily thin with facial with abdominal cavities quite grim in their effect and with aconsequent looseness of apparel that combined with a choice ofqueer light shades and of strange straw like textures of theaspect of chinese mats provocative of wonder at his sources ofsupply suggested the habit of tropic islands a continualcane bottomed chair a governorship exercised on wide verandahs his smooth round head with the particular shade of its whitehair was like a silver pot reversed his cheekbones and thebristle of his moustache were worthy of attila the hun thehollows of his eyes were deep and darksome but the eyes withinthem were like little blue flowers plucked that morning he kneweverything that could be known about life which he regarded as for far the greater part a matter of pecuniary arrangement hiswife accused him of a want alike of moral and of intellectualreaction or rather indeed of a complete incapacity for either he never went even so far as to understand what she meant and itdidn t at all matter since he could be in spite of thelimitation a perfectly social creature the infirmities thepredicaments of men neither surprised nor shocked him andindeed which was perhaps his only real loss in a thrifty career scarce even amused he took them for granted without horror classifying them after their kind and calculating results andchances he might in old bewildering climates in old campaignsof cruelty and license have had such revelations and known suchamazements that he had nothing more to learn but he was whollycontent in spite of his fondness in domestic discussion forthe superlative degree and his kindness in the oddest way seemed to have nothing to do with his experience he could dealwith things perfectly for all his needs without getting nearthem this was the way he dealt with his wife a large proportion ofwhose meanings he knew he could neglect he edited for theirgeneral economy the play of her mind just as he edited savingly with the stump of a pencil her redundant telegrams the thing in the world that was least of a mystery to him was hisclub which he was accepted as perhaps too completely managing and which he managed on lines of perfect penetration hisconnection with it was really a master piece of editing this wasin fact to come back very much the process he might have beenproposing to apply to mrs assingham s view of what was nowbefore them that is to their connection with charlotte stant spossibilities they wouldn t lavish on them all their littlefortune of curiosity and alarm certainly they wouldn t spendtheir cherished savings so early in the day he liked charlotte moreover who was a smooth and compact inmate and whom he feltas with her instincts that made against waste much more of hisown sort than his wife he could talk with her about fanny almostbetter than he could talk with fanny about charlotte however hemade at present the best of the latter necessity even to thepressing of the question he has been noted as having lastuttered if you can t think what to be afraid of wait till youcan think then you ll do it much better or otherwise if that swaiting too long find out from her don t try to find out fromme ask her herself mrs assingham denied as we know that her husband had a play ofmind so that she could on her side treat these remarks only asif they had been senseless physical gestures or nervous facialmovements she overlooked them as from habit and kindness yetthere was no one to whom she talked so persistently of suchintimate things it s her friendship with maggie that s theimmense complication because that she audibly mused is sonatural then why can t she have come out for it she came out mrs assingham continued to meditate becauseshe hates america there was no place for her there she didn tfit in she wasn t in sympathy no more were the people she saw then it s hideously dear she can t on her means begin to livethere not at all as she can in a way here in the way you mean of living with us of living with anyone she can t live by visits alone and shedoesn t want to she s too good for it even if she could butshe will she must sooner or later stay with them maggie willwant her maggie will make her besides she ll want to herself then why won t that do the colonel asked for you to thinkit s what she has come for how will it do how she went on as without hearing him that s what one keeps feeling why shouldn t it do beautifully that anything of the past she brooded should come back now how will it do how will it do it will do i daresay without your wringing your hands over it when my dear the colonel pursued as he smoked have you everseen anything of yours anything that you ve done not do ah i didn t do this it brought her answer straight i didn tbring her back did you expect her to stay over there all her days to obligeyou not a bit for i shouldn t have minded her coming after theirmarriage it s her coming this way before to which she addedwith inconsequence i m too sorry for her of course she can tenjoy it but i don t see what perversity rides her she needn thave looked it all so in the face as she doesn t do it isuppose simply for discipline it s almost that s the bore ofit discipline to me perhaps then said bob assingham that s what has been heridea take it for god s sake as discipline to you and have donewith it it will do he added for discipline to me as well she was far however from having done with it it was asituation with such different sides as she said and to none ofwhich one could in justice be blind it isn t in the least you know for instance that i believe she s bad never never mrs assingham declared i don t think that of her then why isn t that enough nothing was enough mrs assingham signified but that she shoulddevelop her thought she doesn t deliberately intend shedoesn t consciously wish the least complication it s perfectlytrue that she thinks maggie a dear as who doesn t she sincapable of any plan to hurt a hair of her head yet here sheis and there they are she wound up her husband again for a little smoked in silence what in theworld between them ever took place between charlotte and the prince why nothing except theirhaving to recognise that nothing could that was their littleromance it was even their little tragedy but what the deuce did they do do they fell in love with each other but seeing it wasn tpossible gave each other up then where was the romance why in their frustration in their having the courage to lookthe facts in the face what facts the colonel went on well to begin with that of their neither of them having themeans to marry if she had had even a little a little i mean for two i believe he would bravely have done it after which as her husband but emitted an odd vague sound she correctedherself i mean if he himself had had only a little or a littlemore than a little a little for a prince they would have donewhat they could she did them justice if there had been a way but there wasn t a way and charlotte quite to her honour iconsider understood it he had to have money it was a questionof life and death it wouldn t have been a bit amusing either to marry him as a pauper i mean leaving him one that was whatshe had as he had the reason to see and their reason is what you call their romance she looked at him a moment what do you want more didn t he the colonel inquired want anything more ordidn t for that matter poor charlotte herself she kept her eyes on him there was a manner in it that halfanswered they were thoroughly in love she might have beenhis she checked herself she even for a minute lost herself she might have been anything she liked except his wife but she wasn t said the colonel very smokingly she wasn t mrs assingham echoed the echo not loud but deep filled for a little the room heseemed to listen to it die away then he began again how areyou sure she waited before saying but when she spoke it was definite there wasn t time he had a small laugh for her reason he might have expected someother does it take so much time she herself however remained serious it takes more than theyhad he was detached but he wondered what was the matter with theirtime after which as remembering it all living it over andpiecing it together she only considered you mean that you camein with your idea he demanded it brought her quickly to the point and as if also in a measureto answer herself not a bit of it then but you surelyrecall she went on the way a year ago everything tookplace they had parted before he had ever heard of maggie why hadn t he heard of her from charlotte herself because she had never spoken of her is that also the colonel inquired what she has told you i m not speaking his wife returned of what she has told me that s one thing i m speaking of what i know by myself that sanother you feel in other words that she lies to you bob assinghammore sociably asked she neglected the question treating it as gross she never somuch at the time as named maggie it was so positive that it appeared to strike him it s he thenwho has told you she after a moment admitted it it s he and he doesn t lie no to do him justice i believe he absolutely doesn t if ihadn t believed it mrs assingham declared for her generaljustification i would have had nothing to do with him that isin this connection he s a gentleman i mean all as much of oneas he ought to be and he had nothing to gain that helps sheadded even a gentleman it was i who named maggie to him ayear from last may he had never heard of her before then it s grave said the colonel she hesitated do you mean grave for me oh that everything s grave for you is what we take forgranted and are fundamentally talking about it s grave it was for charlotte and it s grave for maggie that is it was when hedid see her or when she did see him you don t torment me as much as you would like she presentlywent on because you think of nothing that i haven t a thousandtimes thought of and because i think of everything that younever will it would all she recognised have been grave if ithadn t all been right you can t make out she contended thatwe got to rome before the end of february he more than agreed there s nothing in life my dear that ican make out well there was nothing in life apparently that she at realneed couldn t charlotte who had been there that year fromearly quite from november left suddenly you ll quite remember about the th of april she was to have stayed on she was tohave stayed naturally more or less for us and she was to havestayed all the more that the ververs due all winter butdelayed week after week in paris were at last really coming they were coming that is maggie was largely to see her andabove all to be with her there it was all altered bycharlotte s going to florence she went from one day to theother you forget everything she gave her reasons but i thoughtit odd at the time i had a sense that something must havehappened the difficulty was that though i knew a little ididn t know enough i didn t know her relation with him had been as you say a near thing that is i didn t know how near thepoor girl s departure was a flight she went to save herself he had listened more than he showed as came out in his tone to save herself well also really i think to save him too i saw itafterwards i see it all now he would have been sorry he didn twant to hurt her oh i daresay the colonel laughed they generally don t at all events his wife pursued she escaped they both did for they had had simply to face it their marriage couldn t be and if that was so the sooner they put the apennines betweenthem the better it had taken them it is true some time to feelthis and to find it out they had met constantly and not alwayspublicly all that winter they had met more than was known though it was a good deal known more certainly she said than i then imagined though i don t know what difference itwould after all have made with me i liked him i thought himcharming from the first of our knowing him and now after morethan a year he has done nothing to spoil it and there arethings he might have done things that many men easily would therefore i believe in him and i was right at first in knowingi was going to so i haven t and she stated it as she mighthave quoted from a slate after adding up the items the sum of acolumn of figures so i haven t i say to myself been a fool well are you trying to make out that i ve said you have alltheir case wants at any rate bob assingham declared is thatyou should leave it well alone it s theirs now they ve boughtit over the counter and paid for it it has ceased to beyours of which case she asked are you speaking he smoked a minute then with a groan lord are there so many there s maggie s and the prince s and there s the prince s andcharlotte s oh yes and then the colonel scoffed there s charlotte s andthe prince s there s maggie s and charlotte s she went on and there salso maggie s and mine i think too that there s charlotte s andmine yes she mused charlotte s and mine is certainly a case in short you see there are plenty but i mean she said tokeep my head are we to settle them all he inquired to night i should lose it if things had happened otherwise if i hadacted with any folly she had gone on in her earnestness unheeding of his question i shouldn t be able to bear that now but my good conscience is my strength no one can accuse me the ververs came on to rome alone charlotte after their dayswith her in florence had decided about america maggie idaresay had helped her she must have made her a present and ahandsome one so that many things were easy charlotte left them came to england joined somebody or other sailed for new york i have still her letter from milan telling me i didn t know atthe moment all that was behind it but i felt in it neverthelessthe undertaking of a new life certainly in any case it clearedthat air i mean the dear old roman in which we were steeped it left the field free it gave me a free hand there was noquestion for me of anybody else when i brought the two otherstogether more than that there was no question for them so yousee she concluded where that puts me she got up on thewords very much as if they were the blue daylight towards which through a darksome tunnel she had been pushing her way and theelation in her voice combined with her recovered alertness might have signified the sharp whistle of the train that shootsat last into the open she turned about the room she looked outa moment into the august night she stopped here and there before the flowers in bowls and vases yes it was distinctly asif she had proved what was needing proof as if the issue of heroperation had been almost unexpectedly a success oldarithmetic had perhaps been fallacious but the new settled thequestion her husband oddly however kept his place withoutapparently measuring these results as he had been amused at herintensity so he was not uplifted by her relief his interestmight in fact have been more enlisted than he allowed do youmean he presently asked that he had already forgot aboutcharlotte she faced round as if he had touched a spring he wanted to naturally and it was much the best thing he could do she wasin possession of the main case as it truly seemed she had itall now he was capable of the effort and he took the best way remember too what maggie then seemed to us she s very nice but she always seems to me more than anythingelse the young woman who has a million a year if you mean thatthat s what she especially seemed to him you of course place thething in your light the effort to forget charlotte couldn t igrant you have been so difficult this pulled her up but for an instant i never said he didn tfrom the first i never said that he doesn t more and more likemaggie s money i never said i shouldn t have liked it myself bob assinghamreturned he made no movement he smoked another minute howmuch did maggie know how much she seemed to consider as if it were between quartsand gallons how best to express the quantity she knew whatcharlotte in florence had told her and what had charlotte told her very little what makes you so sure why this that she couldn t tell her and she explained alittle what she meant there are things my dear haven t youfelt it yourself coarse as you are that no one could tellmaggie there are things that upon my word i shouldn t care toattempt to tell her now the colonel smoked on it she d be so scandalised she d be so frightened she d be in her strange little way sohurt she wasn t born to know evil she must never know it bob assingham had a queer grim laugh the sound of which infact fixed his wife before him we re taking grand ways toprevent it but she stood there to protest we re not taking any ways theways are all taken they were taken from the moment he came up toour carriage that day in villa borghese the second or third ofher days in rome when as you remember you went off somewherewith mr verver and the prince who had got into the carriagewith us came home with us to tea they had met they had seeneach other well they were in relation the rest was to come ofitself and as it could it began practically i recollect inour drive maggie happened to learn by some other man s greetingof him in the bright roman way from a streetcorner as wepassed that one of the prince s baptismal names the one alwaysused for him among his relations was amerigo which as youprobably don t know however even after a lifetime of me wasthe name four hundred years ago or whenever of the pushing manwho followed across the sea in the wake of columbus andsucceeded where columbus had failed in becoming godfather orname father to the new continent so that the thought of anyconnection with him can even now thrill our artless breasts the colonel s grim placidity could always quite adequately meethis wife s not infrequent imputation of ignorances on the scoreof the land of her birth unperturbed and unashamed and thesedark depths were even at the present moment not directly lightedby an inquiry that managed to be curious without beingapologetic but where does the connection come in his wife was prompt by the women that is by some obligingwoman of old who was a descendant of the pushing man themake believe discoverer and whom the prince is therefore luckilyable to refer to as an ancestress a branch of the other familyhad become great great enough at least to marry into his andthe name of the navigator crowned with glory was verynaturally to become so the fashion among them that some son ofevery generation was appointed to wear it my point is at anyrate that i recall noticing at the time how the prince was fromthe start helped with the dear ververs by his wearing it theconnection became romantic for maggie the moment she took it in she filled out in a flash every link that might be vague bythat sign i quite said to myself he ll conquer with hisgood fortune of course of having the other necessary signs too it really said mrs assingham was practically the fine sideof the wedge which struck me as also she wound up a lovelynote for the candour of the ververs the colonel took in the tale but his comment was prosaic heknew amerigo what he was about and i don t mean the old one i know what you mean his wife bravely threw off the old one he pointed his effect isn t the only discovererin the family oh as much as you like if he discovered america or gothimself honoured as if he had his successors were in due time to discover the americans and it was one of them in particular doubtless who was to discover how patriotic we are wouldn t this be the same one the colonel asked who reallydiscovered what you call the connection she gave him a look the connection s a true thing theconnection s perfectly historic your insinuations recoil uponyour cynical mind don t you understand she asked that thehistory of such people is known root and branch at every momentof its course oh it s all right said bob assingham go to the british museum his companion continued with spirit and what am i to do there there s a whole immense room or recess or department orwhatever filled with books written about his family alone youcan see for yourself have you seen for your self she faltered but an instant certainly i went one day withmaggie we looked him up so to say they were most civil andshe fell again into the current her husband had slightly ruffled the effect was produced the charm began to work at all events in rome from that hour of the prince s drive with us my onlycourse afterwards had to be to make the best of it it wascertainly good enough for that mrs assingham hastened to add and i didn t in the least see my duty in making the worst inthe same situation to day i wouldn t act differently i enteredinto the case as it then appeared to me and as for the matterof that it still does i liked it i thought all sorts of goodof it and nothing can even now she said with some intensity make me think anything else nothing can ever make you think anything you don t want to thecolonel still in his chair remarked over his pipe you ve gota precious power of thinking whatever you do want you want also from moment to moment to think such desperately differentthings what happened he went on was that you fell violentlyin love with the prince yourself and that as you couldn t get meout of the way you had to take some roundabout course youcouldn t marry him any more than charlotte could that is not toyourself but you could to somebody else it was always theprince it was always marriage you could to your little friend to whom there were no objections not only there were no objections but there were reasons positive ones and all excellent all charming she spoke withan absence of all repudiation of his exposure of the spring ofher conduct and this abstention clearly and effectivelyconscious evidently cost her nothing it is always the prince and it is always thank heaven marriage and these are thethings god grant that it will always be that i could help ayear ago most assuredly made me happy and it continues to makeme happy then why aren t you quiet i am quiet said fanny assingham he looked at her with his colourless candour still in hisplace she moved about again a little emphasising by her unresther declaration of her tranquillity he was as silent at first as if he had taken her answer but he was not to keep it long what do you make of it that by your own show charlottecouldn t tell her all what do you make of it that the princedidn t tell her anything say one understands that there arethings she can t be told since as you put it she is so easilyscared and shocked he produced these objections slowly givingher time by his pauses to stop roaming and come back to him but she was roaming still when he concluded his inquiry ifthere hadn t been anything there shouldn t have been between thepair before charlotte bolted in order precisely as you say that there shouldn t be why in the world was what there hadbeen too bad to be spoken of mrs assingham after this question continued still tocirculate not directly meeting it even when at last she stopped i thought you wanted me to be quiet so i do and i m trying to make you so much so that you won tworry more can t you be quiet on that she thought a moment then seemed to try to relate that she hadto bolt for the reasons we speak of even though the boltinghad done for her what she wished that i can perfectly feelcharlotte s not wanting to do ah then if it has done for her what she wished but thecolonel s conclusion hung by the if which his wife didn t takeup so it hung but the longer when he presently spoke again allone wonders in that case is why then she has come back to him say she hasn t come back to him not really to him i ll say anything you like but that won t do me the same goodas your saying it nothing my dear will do you good mrs assingham returned you don t care for anything in itself you care for nothing butto be grossly amused because i don t keep washing my hands i thought your whole argument was that everything is so rightthat this is precisely what you do but his wife as it was a point she had often made could go onas she had gone on before you re perfectly indifferent really you re perfectly immoral you ve taken part in the sack ofcities and i m sure you ve done dreadful things yourself but idon t trouble my head if you like so now there she laughed he accepted her laugh but he kept his way well i back poorcharlotte back her to know what she wants ah then so do i she does know what she wants and mrs assingham produced this quantity at last on the girl s behalf as the ripe result of her late wanderings and musings she hadgroped through their talk for the thread and now she had gotit she wants to be magnificent she is said the colonel almost cynically she wants his wife now had it fast to be thoroughly superior and she s capable of that of wanting to of carrying out her idea and what is her idea to see maggie through bob assingham wondered through what through everything she knows the prince and maggie doesn t no dear thing mrs assingham had torecognise it she doesn t so that charlotte has come out to give her lessons she continued fanny assingham to work out her thought she hasdone this great thing for him that is a year ago shepractically did it she practically at any rate helped him todo it himself and helped me to help him she kept off shestayed away she left him free and what moreover were hersilences to maggie but a direct aid to him if she had spoken inflorence if she had told her own poor story if she had comeback at any time till within a few weeks ago if she hadn t goneto new york and hadn t held out there if she hadn t done thesethings all that has happened since would certainly have beendifferent therefore she s in a position to be consistent now she knows the prince mrs assingham repeated it involved evenagain her former recognition and maggie dear thing doesn t she was high she was lucid she was almost inspired and it wasbut the deeper drop therefore to her husband s flat common sense in other words maggie is by her ignorance in danger then ifshe s in danger there is danger there won t be with charlotte s understanding of it that swhere she has had her conception of being able to be heroic ofbeing able in fact to be sublime she is she will be the goodlady by this time glowed so she sees it to become for herbest friend an element of positive safety bob assingham looked at it hard which of them do you call herbest friend she gave a toss of impatience i ll leave you to discover butthe grand truth thus made out she had now completely adopted it s for us therefore to be hers hers you and i it s for us to be charlotte s it s for us on ourside to see her through through her sublimity through her noble lonely life only that s essential itmustn t be lonely it will be all right if she marries so we re to marry her we re to marry her it will be mrs assingham continued thegreat thing i can do she made it out more and more it willmake up make up for what as she said nothing however his desire forlucidity renewed itself if everything s so all right what isthere to make up for why if i did do either of them by any chance a wrong if imade a mistake you ll make up for it by making another and then as she againtook her time i thought your whole point is just that you resure one can never be ideally sure of anything there are alwayspossibilities then if we can but strike so wild why keep meddling it made her again look at him where would you have been mydear if i hadn t meddled with you ah that wasn t meddling i was your own i was your own saidthe colonel from the moment i didn t object well these people won t object they are my own too in thesense that i m awfully fond of them also in the sense shecontinued that i think they re not so very much less fond ofme our relation all round exists it s a reality and a verygood one we re mixed up so to speak and it s too late tochange it we must live in it and with it therefore to see thatcharlotte gets a good husband as soon as possible that as isay will be one of my ways of living it will cover she saidwith conviction all the ground and then as his own convictionappeared to continue as little to match the ground i mean ofany nervousness i may ever feel it will be in fact my dutyand i shan t rest till my duty s performed she had arrived bythis time at something like exaltation i shall give for thenext year or two if necessary my life to it i shall have donein that case what i can he took it at last as it came you hold there s no limit to whatyou can i don t say there s no limit or anything of the sort i saythere are good chances enough of them for hope why shouldn tthere be when a girl is after all all that she is by after all you mean after she s in love with somebody else the colonel put his question with a quietude doubtless designedto be fatal but it scarcely pulled her up she s not too muchin love not herself to want to marry she would now particularlylike to has she told you so not yet it s too soon but she will meanwhile however idon t require the information her marrying will prove thetruth and what truth the truth of everything i say prove it to whom well to myself to begin with that will be enough for me towork for her what it will prove mrs assingham presently wenton will be that she s cured that she accepts the situation he paid this the tribute of a long pull at his pipe thesituation of doing the one thing she can that will really seem tocover her tracks his wife looked at him the good dry man as if now at last hewas merely vulgar the one thing she can do that will reallymake new tracks altogether the thing that before any other will be wise and right the thing that will best give her herchance to be magnificent he slowly emitted his smoke and best give you by the sametoken yours to be magnificent with her i shall be as magnificent at least as i can bob assingham got up and you call me immoral she hesitated i ll call you stupid if you prefer but stupiditypushed to a certain point is you know immorality just so whatis morality but high intelligence this he was unable to tellher which left her more definitely to conclude besides it sall at the worst great fun oh if you simply put it at that his implication was that in this case they had a common ground yet even thus he couldn t catch her by it oh i don t mean she said from the threshold the fun that you mean good night in answer to which as he turned out the electric light he gavean odd short groan almost a grunt he had apparently meant someparticular kind v well now i must tell you for i want to be absolutely honest so charlotte spoke a little ominously after they had got intothe park i don t want to pretend and i can t pretend a momentlonger you may think of me what you will but i don t care iknew i shouldn t and i find now how little i came back for this not really for anything else for this she repeated as underthe influence of her tone the prince had already come to apause for this he spoke as if the particular thing she indicatedwere vague to him or were rather a quantity that couldn t atthe most be much it would be as much however as she should be able to make it to have one hour alone with you it had rained heavily in thenight and though the pavements were now dry thanks to acleansing breeze the august morning with its hovering thick drifting clouds and freshened air was cool and grey themultitudinous green of the park had been deepened and awholesome smell of irrigation purging the place of dust and ofodours less acceptable rose from the earth charlotte had lookedabout her with expression from the first of their coming in quite as if for a deep greeting for general recognition the daywas even in the heart of london of a rich low browed weatherwashed english type it was as if it had been waiting forher as if she knew it placed it loved it as if it were infact a part of what she had come back for so far as this was thecase the impression of course could only be lost on a mere vagueitalian it was one of those for which you had to be blessedly an american as indeed you had to be blessedly an american forall sorts of things so long as you hadn t blessedly or not toremain in america the prince had by half past ten as also bydefinite appointment called in cadogan place for mrs assingham s visitor and then after brief delay the two hadwalked together up sloane street and got straight into the parkfrom knightsbridge the understanding to this end had taken itsplace after a couple of days as inevitably consequent on theappeal made by the girl during those first moments in mrs assingham s drawing room it was an appeal the couple of days haddone nothing to invalidate everything much rather to place ina light and as to which obviously it wouldn t have fitted thatanyone should raise an objection who was there for that matter to raise one from the moment mrs assingham informed andapparently not disapproving didn t intervene this the young manhad asked himself with a very sufficient sense of what wouldhave made him ridiculous he wasn t going to begin that at leastwas certain by showing a fear even had fear at first been sharpin him moreover it would already not a little have dropped so happy all round so propitious he quite might have calledit had been the effect of this rapid interval the time had been taken up largely by his active reception of hisown wedding guests and by maggie s scarce less absorbedentertainment of her friend whom she had kept for hours togetherin portland place whom she had not as wouldn t have beenconvenient invited altogether as yet to migrate but who hadbeen present with other persons his contingent at luncheon attea at dinner at perpetual repasts he had never in his life it struck him had to reckon with so much eating whenever he hadlooked in if he had not again till this hour save for aminute seen charlotte alone so positively all the while hehad not seen even maggie and if therefore he had not seen evenmaggie nothing was more natural than that he shouldn t have seencharlotte the exceptional minute a mere snatch at the tail ofthe others on the huge portland place staircase had sufficientlyenabled the girl to remind him so ready she assumed him to be of what they were to do time pressed if they were to do it atall everyone had brought gifts his relations had broughtwonders how did they still have where did they still find suchtreasures she only had brought nothing and she was ashamed yeteven by the sight of the rest of the tribute she wouldn t be putoff she would do what she could and he was unknown to maggie he must remember to give her his aid he had prolonged theminute so far as to take time to hesitate for a reason and thento risk bringing his reason out the risk was because he mighthurt her hurt her pride if she had that particular sort butshe might as well be hurt one way as another and besides thatparticular sort of pride was just what she hadn t so his slightresistance while they lingered had been just easy enough not tobe impossible i hate to encourage you and for such a purpose after all tospend your money she had stood a stair or two below him where while she lookedup at him beneath the high domed light of the hall she rubbedwith her palm the polished mahogany of the balustrade which wasmounted on fine ironwork eighteenth century english becauseyou think i must have so little i ve enough at any rate enoughfor us to take our hour enough she had smiled is as good asa feast and then she had said it isn t of course a questionof anything expensive gorged with treasure as maggie is itisn t a question of competing or outshining what naturally inthe way of the priceless hasn t she got mine is to be theoffering of the poor something precisely that no rich personcould ever give her and that being herself too rich ever to buyit she would therefore never have charlotte had spoken as ifafter so much thought only as it can t be fine it ought to befunny and that s the sort of thing to hunt for hunting inlondon besides is amusing in itself he recalled even how he had been struck with her word funny oh i don t mean a comic toy i mean some little thing with acharm but absolutely right in its comparative cheapness that swhat i call funny she had explained you used she had alsoadded to help me to get things cheap in rome you were splendidfor beating down i have them all still i needn t say thelittle bargains i there owed you there are bargains in london inaugust ah but i don t understand your english buying and i confess ifind it dull so much as that while they turned to go uptogether he had objected i understood my poor dear romans it was they who understood you that was your pull she hadlaughed our amusement here is just that they don t understandus we can make it amusing you ll see if he had hesitated again it was because the point permitted the amusement surely will be to find our present certainly as i say well if they don t come down then we ll come up there s always something to be done besides prince she had gone on i m not if you come to that absolutely a pauper i m too poor for some things she hadsaid yet strange as she was lightly enough but i m not toopoor for others and she had paused again at the top i ve beensaving up he had really challenged it in america yes even there with my motive and we oughtn t you know shehad wound up to leave it beyond to morrow that definitely with ten words more was what had passed hefeeling all the while how any sort of begging off would onlymagnify it he might get on with things as they were but he mustdo anything rather than magnify besides which it was pitiful tomake her beg of him he was making her she had begged and this for a special sensibility in him didn t at all do that wasaccordingly in fine how they had come to where they were hewas engaged as hard as possible in the policy of notmagnifying he had kept this up even on her making a point andas if it were almost the whole point that maggie of course wasnot to have an idea half the interest of the thing at leastwould be that she shouldn t suspect therefore he was completelyto keep it from her as charlotte on her side would that theyhad been anywhere at all together or had so much as seen eachother for five minutes alone the absolute secrecy of theirlittle excursion was in short of the essence she appealed to hiskindness to let her feel that he didn t betray her there hadbeen something frankly a little disconcerting in such an appealat such an hour on the very eve of his nuptials it was onething to have met the girl casually at mrs assingham s andanother to arrange with her thus for a morning practically asprivate as their old mornings in rome and practically not lessintimate he had immediately told maggie the same evening ofthe minutes that had passed between them in cadogan place thoughnot mentioning those of mrs assingham s absence any more than hementioned the fact of what their friend had then with such smalldelay proposed but what had briefly checked his assent to anypresent to any positive making of mystery what had made him while they stood at the top of the stairs demur just long enoughfor her to notice it was the sense of the resemblance of thelittle plan before him to occasions of the past from which hewas quite disconnected from which he could only desire to be this was like beginning something over which was the last thinghe wanted the strength the beauty of his actual position was inits being wholly a fresh start was that what it began would benew altogether these items of his consciousness had clustered soquickly that by the time charlotte read them in his face he wasin presence of what they amounted to she had challenged them assoon as read them had met them with a do you want then to goand tell her that had somehow made them ridiculous it had madehim promptly fall back on minimizing it that is on minimizing fuss apparent scruples were obviously fuss and he had onthe spot clutched in the light of this truth at the happyprinciple that would meet every case this principle was simply to be with the girl always simple and with the very last simplicity that would cover everything it had covered then and there certainly his immediatesubmission to the sight of what was clearest this was really that what she asked was little compared to what she gave whatshe gave touched him as she faced him for it was the full tuneof her renouncing she really renounced renounced everything and without even insisting now on what it had all been for her her only insistence was her insistence on the small matter oftheir keeping their appointment to themselves that in exchangefor everything everything she gave up was verily but atrifle he let himself accordingly be guided he so soonassented for enlightened indulgence to any particular turn shemight wish the occasion to take that the stamp of her preferencehad been well applied to it even while they were still in thepark the application in fact presently required that they shouldsit down a little really to see where they were in obedience towhich propriety they had some ten minutes of a quality quitedistinct in a couple of penny chairs under one of the largertrees they had taken for their walk to the cropped rain freshened grass after finding it already dry and thechairs turned away from the broad alley the main drive and theaspect of park lane looked across the wide reaches of greenwhich seemed in a manner to refine upon their freedom theyhelped charlotte thus to make her position her temporaryposition still more clear and it was for this purpose obviously that abruptly on seeing her opportunity she satdown he stood for a little before her as if to mark theimportance of not wasting time the importance she herself hadpreviously insisted on but after she had said a few words it wasimpossible for him not to resort again to good nature he markedas he could by this concession that if he had finally met herfirst proposal for what would be amusing in it so any idea shemight have would contribute to that effect he had consequently in all consistency to treat it as amusing that she reaffirmed and reaffirmed again the truth that was her truth i don t care what you make of it and i don t ask anythingwhatever of you anything but this i want to have said it that s all i want not to have failed to say it to see you onceand be with you to be as we are now and as we used to be forone small hour or say for two that s what i have had for weeksin my head i mean of course to get it before before whatyou re going to do so all the while you see she went on withher eyes on him it was a question for me if i should be able tomanage it in time if i couldn t have come now i probablyshouldn t have come at all perhaps even ever now that i m herei shall stay but there were moments over there when idespaired it wasn t easy there were reasons but it was eitherthis or nothing so i didn t struggle you see in vain after oh i didn t want that i don t mean she smiled that itwouldn t have been delightful to see you even then to see you atany time but i would never have come for it this is different this is what i wanted this is what i ve got this is what ishall always have this is what i should have missed of course she pursued if you had chosen to make me miss it if you hadthought me horrid had refused to come i should naturally havebeen immensely sold i had to take the risk well you re all icould have hoped that s what i was to have said i didn t wantsimply to get my time with you but i wanted you to know iwanted you she kept it up slowly softly with a small tremorof voice but without the least failure of sense or sequence iwanted you to understand i wanted you that is to hear i don tcare i think whether you understand or not if i ask nothing ofyou i don t i mayn t ask even so much as that what you maythink of me that doesn t in the least matter what i want isthat it shall always be with you so that you ll never be ablequite to get rid of it that i did i won t say that you did youmay make as little of that as you like but that i was here withyou where we are and as we are i just saying this givingmyself in other words away and perfectly willing to do it fornothing that s all she paused as if her demonstration was complete yet for themoment without moving as if in fact to give it a few minutes tosink in into the listening air into the watching space intothe conscious hospitality of nature so far as nature was alllondonised all vulgarised with them there or even for thatmatter into her own open ears rather than into the attention ofher passive and prudent friend his attention had done all thatattention could do his handsome slightly anxious yet stillmore definitely amused face sufficiently played its part heclutched however at what he could best clutch at the fact thatshe let him off definitely let him off she let him off itseemed even from so much as answering so that while he smiledback at her in return for her information he felt his lips remainclosed to the successive vaguenesses of rejoinder of objection that rose for him from within charlotte herself spoke again atlast you may want to know what i get by it but that s my ownaffair he really didn t want to know even this or continued for the safest plan quite to behave as if he didn t whichprolonged the mere dumbness of diversion in which he had takenrefuge he was glad when finally the point she had wished tomake seeming established to her satisfaction they brought towhat might pass for a close the moment of his life at which hehad had least to say movement and progress after this withmore impersonal talk were naturally a relief so that he was notagain during their excursion at a loss for the right word theair had been as it were cleared they had their errand itselfto discuss and the opportunities of london the sense of thewonderful place the pleasures of prowling there the question ofshops of possibilities of particular objects noticed by eachin previous prowls each professed surprise at the extent of theother s knowledge the prince in especial wondered at hisfriend s possession of her london he had rather prized his ownpossession the guidance he could really often give a cabman itwas a whim of his own a part of his anglomania and congruouswith that feature which had after all so much more surfacethan depth when his companion with the memory of other visitsand other rambles spoke of places he hadn t seen and things hedidn t know he actually felt again as half the effect just ashade humiliated he might even have felt a trifle annoyed if ithadn t been on this spot for his being even more interested it was a fresh light on charlotte and on her curiousworld quality of which in rome he had had his due sense butwhich clearly would show larger on the big london stage romewas in comparison a village a family party a little old worldspinnet for the fingers of one hand by the time they reached themarble arch it was almost as if she were showing him a new side and that in fact gave amusement a new and a firmer basis theright tone would be easy for putting himself in her hands shouldthey disagree a little frankly and fairly about directions andchances values and authenticities the situation would be quitegloriously saved they were none the less as happened much ofone mind on the article of their keeping clear of resorts withwhich maggie would be acquainted charlotte recalled it as amatter of course named it in time as a condition they wouldkeep away from any place to which he had already been withmaggie this made indeed a scant difference for though he had during thelast month done few things so much as attend his future wife onher making of purchases the antiquarii as he called them withcharlotte had not been the great affair except in bond street really maggie had had no use for them her situation indeed inconnection with that order of traffic was full of consequencesproduced by her father s mr verver one of the great collectorsof the world hadn t left his daughter to prowl for herself hehad little to do with shops and was mostly as a purchaser approached privately and from afar great people all overeurope sought introductions to him high personages incrediblyhigh and more of them than would ever be known solemnly swornas everyone was in such cases to discretion high personagesmade up to him as the one man on the short authentic list likelyto give the price it had therefore been easy to settle as theywalked that the tracks of the ververs daughter s as well asfather s were to be avoided the importance only was that theirtalk about it led for a moment to the first words they had as yetexchanged on the subject of maggie charlotte still in the park proceeded to them for it was she who began with a serenity ofappreciation that was odd certainly as a sequel to her words often minutes before this was another note on her what he wouldhave called another light for her companion who though withoutgiving a sign admired for what it was the simplicity of hertransition a transition that took no trouble either to trace orto explain itself she paused again an instant on the grass tomake it she stopped before him with a sudden anything ofcourse dear as she is will do for her i mean if i were to giveher a pin cushion from the baker street bazaar that s exactly what i meant the prince laughed out thisallusion to their snatch of talk in portland place it s justwhat i suggested she took however no notice of the reminder she went on in herown way but it isn t a reason in that case one would never doanything for her i mean charlotte explained if one tookadvantage of her character of her character we mustn t take advantage of her character the girl againunheeding pursued one mustn t if not for her at least forone s self she saves one such trouble she had spoken thoughtfully with her eyes on her friend s shemight have been talking preoccupied and practical of someonewith whom he was comparatively unconnected she certainly givesone no trouble said the prince and then as if this wereperhaps ambiguous or inadequate she s not selfish god forgiveher enough that s what i mean charlotte instantly said she s notselfish enough there s nothing absolutely that one need do forher she s so modest she developed she doesn t miss things imean if you love her or rather i should say if she loves you she lets it go the prince frowned a little as a tribute after all toseriousness she lets what anything anything that you might do and that you don t shelets everything go but her own disposition to be kind to you it s of herself that she asks efforts so far as she ever has toask them she hasn t much she does everything herself andthat s terrible the prince had listened but always with propriety he didn tcommit himself terrible well unless one is almost as good as she it makes too easyterms for one it takes stuff within one so far as one sdecency is concerned to stand it and nobody charlottecontinued in the same manner is decent enough good enough tostand it not without help from religion or something of thatkind not without prayer and fasting that is without takinggreat care certainly she said such people as you and i arenot the prince obligingly thought an instant not good enough tostand it well not good enough not rather to feel the strain we happeneach i think to be of the kind that are easily spoiled her friend again for propriety followed the argument oh idon t know may not one s affection for her do something more forone s decency as you call it than her own generosity her ownaffection her decency has the unfortunate virtue to undo ah of course it must be all in that but she had made her question all the same interesting to him what it comes to one can see what you mean is the way shebelieves in one that is if she believes at all yes that s what it comes to said charlotte stant and why he asked almost soothingly should it be terrible he couldn t at the worst see that because it s always so the idea of having to pity people not when there s also with it the idea of helping them yes but if we can t help them we can we always can that is he competently added if wecare for them and that s what we re talking about yes she on the whole assented it comes back then to ourabsolutely refusing to be spoiled certainly but everything the prince laughed as they went on all your decency i mean comes back to that she walked beside him a moment it s just what i meant shethen reasonably said vithe man in the little shop in which well after this theylingered longest the small but interesting dealer in thebloomsbury street who was remarkable for an insistence notimportunate inasmuch as it was mainly mute but singularly intensely coercive this personage fixed on his visitors anextraordinary pair of eyes and looked from one to the other whilethey considered the object with which he appeared mainly to hopeto tempt them they had come to him last for their time wasnearly up an hour of it at least from the moment of theirgetting into a hansom at the marble arch having yielded nobetter result than the amusement invoked from the first theamusement of course was to have consisted in seeking but ithad also involved the idea of finding which latter necessitywould have been obtrusive only if they had found too soon thequestion at present was if they were finding and they put it toeach other in the bloomsbury shop while they enjoyed theundiverted attention of the shopman he was clearly the master and devoted to his business the essence of which in hisconception might precisely have been this particular secret thathe possessed for worrying the customer so little that it fairlymade for their relations a sort of solemnity he had not manythings none of the redundancy of rot they had elsewhere seen and our friends had on entering even had the sense of a musterso scant that as high values obviously wouldn t reign theeffect might be almost pitiful then their impression hadchanged for though the show was of small pieces several takenfrom the little window and others extracted from a cupboardbehind the counter dusky in the rather low browed place despite its glass doors each bid for their attention spoke however modestly for itself and the pitch of theirentertainer s pretensions was promptly enough given his arraywas heterogeneous and not at all imposing still it differedagreeably from what they had hitherto seen charlotte after the incident was to be full of impressions ofseveral of which later on she gave her companion always in theinterest of their amusement the benefit and one of theimpressions had been that the man himself was the greatestcuriosity they had looked at the prince was to reply to thisthat he himself hadn t looked at him as precisely in thegeneral connection charlotte had more than once from otherdays noted for his advantage her consciousness of how below acertain social plane he never saw one kind of shopman was justlike another to him which was oddly inconsequent on the part ofa mind that where it did notice noticed so much he tookthroughout always the meaner sort for granted the night oftheir meanness or whatever name one might give it for him madeall his cats grey he didn t no doubt want to hurt them but heimaged them no more than if his eyes acted only for the level ofhis own high head her own vision acted for every relation thishe had seen for himself she remarked beggars she rememberedservants she recognised cabmen she had often distinguishedbeauty when out with him in dirty children she had admired type in faces at hucksters stalls therefore on thisoccasion she had found their antiquario interesting partlybecause he cared so for his things and partly because he cared well so for them he likes his things he loves them she wasto say and it isn t only it isn t perhaps even at all that heloves to sell them i think he would love to keep them if hecould and he prefers at any rate to sell them to right people we clearly were right people he knows them when he sees them and that s why as i say you could make out or at least i could that he cared for us didn t you see she was to ask itwith an insistence the way he looked at us and took us in idoubt if either of us have ever been so well looked at before yes he ll remember us she was to profess herself convinced ofthat almost to uneasiness but it was after all this wasperhaps reassuring because given his taste since he hastaste he was pleased with us he was struck he had ideas aboutus well i should think people might we re beautiful aren twe and he knows then also he has his way for that way ofsaying nothing with his lips when he s all the while pressing youso with his face which shows how he knows you feel it that is aregular way of decent old gold old silver old bronze of old chased andjewelled artistry were the objects that successively produced had ended by numerously dotting the counter where the shopman sslim light fingers with neat nails

that was thedifficulty pretentious without being good too usual as atreasure to have been an inspiration of the giver and yet tooprimitive to be taken as tribute welcome on any terms they hadbeen out more than two hours and evidently had found nothing it forced from charlotte a kind of admission it ought really if it should be a thing of this sort to takeits little value from having belonged to one s self ecco said the prince just triumphantly enough there youare behind the dealer were sundry small cupboards in the wall two orthree of these charlotte had seen him open so that her eyesfound themselves resting on those he had not visited but shecompleted her admission there s nothing here she could wear it was only after a moment that her companion rejoined is thereanything do you think that you could it made her just start she didn t at all events look at theobjects she but looked for an instant very directly at him no ah the prince quietly exclaimed would it be charlotte asked your idea to offer mesomething well why not as a small ricordo but a ricordo of what why of this as you yourself say of this little hunt oh i say it but hasn t my whole point been that i don t askyou to therefore she demanded but smiling at him now where s the logic oh the logic he laughed but logic s everything that at least is how i feel it aricordo from you from you to me is a ricordo of nothing ithas no reference ah my dear he vaguely protested their entertainer meanwhile stood there with his eyes on them and the girl though at this minute more interested in her passage with herfriend than in anything else again met his gaze it was acomfort to her that their foreign tongue covered what they said and they might have appeared of course as the prince now had oneof the snuffboxes in his hand to be discussing a purchase you don t refer she went on to her companion i refer he had lifted the lid of his little box and he looked into ithard do you mean by that then that you would be free free to offer me something this gave her a longer pause and when she spoke again she mighthave seemed oddly to be addressing the dealer would you allowme no said the prince into his little box you wouldn t accept it from me no he repeated in the same way she exhaled a long breath that was like a guarded sigh butyou ve touched an idea that has been mine it s what i vewanted then she added it was what i hoped he put down his box this had drawn his eyes he made nothing clearly of the little man s attention it s what you brought meout for well that s at any rate she returned my own affair butit won t do it won t do cara mia it s impossible it s impossible and he took up one of the brooches she had another pause while the shopman only waited if i wereto accept from you one of these charming little ornaments as yousuggest what should i do with it he was perhaps at last a little irritated he even as if hemight understand looked vaguely across at their host wear it per bacco where then please under my clothes wherever you like but it isn t then if you will he added worth talking about it s only worth talking about mio caro she smiled from yourhaving begun it my question is only reasonable so that youridea may stand or fall by your answer to it if i should pin oneof these things on for you would it be to your mind that imight go home and show it to maggie as your present they had had between them often in talk the refrain jocosely descriptively applied of old roman it had been as apleasantry in the other time his explanation to her ofeverything but nothing truly had even seemed so old roman asthe shrug in which he now indulged why in the world not because on our basis it would be impossible to give her anaccount of the pretext the pretext he wondered the occasion this ramble that we shall have had together andthat we re not to speak of oh yes he said after a moment i remember we re not to speakof it that of course you re pledged to and the one thing you see goes with the other so you don t insist he had again at random laid back his trinket with which hequite turned to her a little wearily at last even a littleimpatiently i don t insist it disposed for the time of the question but what was nextapparent was that it had seen them no further the shopman whohad not stirred stood there in his patience which his muteintensity helping had almost the effect of an ironic comment the prince moved to the glass door and his back to the others as with nothing more to contribute looked though not lesspatiently into the street then the shopman for charlotte momentously broke silence you ve seen disgraziatamente signora principessa he sadly said too much and it made theprince face about for the effect of the momentous came if notfrom the sense from the sound of his words which was that ofthe suddenest sharpest italian charlotte exchanged with herfriend a glance that matched it and just for the minute theywere held in check but their glance had after all by thattime said more than one thing had both exclaimed on theapprehension by the wretch of their intimate conversation letalone of her possible her impossible title and remarked formutual reassurance that it didn t all the same matter theprince remained by the door but immediately addressing thespeaker from where he stood you re italian then are you but the reply came in english oh dear no you re english to which the answer was this time with a smile in briefestitalian che the dealer waived the question he practicallydisposed of it by turning straightway toward a receptacle towhich he had not yet resorted and from which after unlocking it he extracted a square box of some twenty inches in height covered with worn looking leather he placed the box on thecounter pushed back a pair of small hooks lifted the lid andremoved from its nest a drinking vessel larger than a common cup yet not of exorbitant size and formed to appearance either ofold fine gold or of some material once richly gilt he handled itwith tenderness with ceremony making a place for it on a smallsatin mat my golden bowl he observed and it sounded on hislips as if it said everything he left the important object foras important it did somehow present itself to produce itscertain effect simple but singularly elegant it stood on acircular foot a short pedestal with a slightly spreading base and though not of signal depth justified its title by the charmof its shape as well as by the tone of its surface it might havebeen a large goblet diminished to the enhancement of its happycurve by half its original height as formed of solid gold itwas impressive it seemed indeed to warn off the prudent admirer charlotte with care immediately took it up while the prince who had after a minute shifted his position again regarded itfrom a distance it was heavier than charlotte had thought gold really gold she asked of their companion he hesitated look a little and perhaps you ll make out she looked holding it up in both her fine hands turning it tothe light it may be cheap for what it is but it will be dear i m afraid for me well said the man i can part with it for less than itsvalue i got it you see for less for how much then again he waited always with his serene stare do you like itthen charlotte turned to her friend do you like it he came nonearer he looked at their companion cos e well signori miei if you must know it s just a perfectcrystal of course we must know per dio said the prince but he turnedaway again he went back to his glass door charlotte set down the bowl she was evidently taken do youmean it s cut out of a single crystal if it isn t i think i can promise you that you ll never find anyjoint or any piecing she wondered even if i were to scrape off the gold he showed though with due respect that she amused him youcouldn t scrape it off it has been too well put on put on idon t know when and i don t know how but by some very fine oldworker and by some beautiful old process charlotte frankly charmed with the cup smiled back at him now a lost art call it a lost art but of what time then is the whole thing well say also of a lost time the girl considered then if it s so precious how comes it tobe cheap her interlocutor once more hung fire but by this time the princehad lost patience i ll wait for you out in the air he said tohis companion and though he spoke without irritation hepointed his remark by passing immediately into the street where during the next minutes the others saw him his back to theshopwindow philosophically enough hover and light a freshcigarette charlotte even took a little her time she was awareof his funny italian taste for london street life her host meanwhile at any rate answered her question ah i vehad it a long time without selling it i think i must have beenkeeping it madam for you you ve kept it for me because you ve thought i mightn t seewhat s the matter with it he only continued to face her he only continued to appear tofollow the play of her mind what is the matter with it oh it s not for me to say it s for you honestly to tell me ofcourse i know something must be but if it s something you can t find out isn t it as good as ifit were nothing i probably should find out as soon as i had paid for it not her host lucidly insisted if you hadn t paid too much what do you call she asked little enough well what should you say to fifteen pounds i should say said charlotte with the utmost promptitude thatit s altogether too much the dealer shook his head slowly and sadly but firmly it s myprice madam and if you admire the thing i think it really mightbe yours it s not too much it s too little it s almostnothing i can t go lower charlotte wondering but resisting bent over the bowl again then it s impossible it s more than i can afford ah the man returned one can sometimes afford for a presentmore than one can afford for one s self he said it so coaxinglythat she found herself going on without as might be said putting him in his place oh of course it would be only for apresent then it would be a lovely one does one make a present she asked of an object thatcontains to one s knowledge a flaw well if one knows of it one has only to mention it the goodfaith the man smiled is always there and leave the person to whom one gives the thing you mean todiscover it he wouldn t discover it if you re speaking of a gentleman i m not speaking of anyone in particular charlotte said well whoever it might be he might know and he might try buthe wouldn t find she kept her eyes on him as if though unsatisfied mystified she yet had a fancy for the bowl not even if the thing shouldcome to pieces and then as he was silent not even if heshould have to say to me the golden bowl is broken he was still silent after which he had his strangest smile ah if anyone should want to smash it she laughed she almost admired the little man s expression youmean one could smash it with a hammer yes if nothing else would do or perhaps even by dashing itwith violence say upon a marble floor oh marble floors but she might have been thinking for theywere a connection marble floors a connection with many things with her old rome and with his with the palaces of his past and a little of hers with the possibilities of his future with the sumptuosities of his marriage with the wealth of theververs all the same however there were other things and theyall together held for a moment her fancy does crystal thenbreak when it is crystal i thought its beauty was itshardness her friend in his way discriminated its beauty is its beingcrystal but its hardness is certainly its safety it doesn tbreak he went on like vile glass it splits if there is asplit ah charlotte breathed with interest if there is a split and she looked down again at the bowl there is a split eh crystal does split eh on lines and by laws of its own you mean if there s a weak place for all answer after an hesitation he took the bowl up again holding it aloft and tapping it with a key it rang with thefinest sweetest sound where is the weak place she then did the question justice well for me only the price i m poor you see very poor but i thank you and i ll think the prince on the other side of the shop window had finallyfaced about and as to see if she hadn t done was trying toreach with his eyes the comparatively dim interior i likeit she said i want it but i must decide what i can do the man not ungraciously resigned himself well i ll keep itfor you the small quarter of an hour had had its marked oddity this shefelt even by the time the open air and the bloomsbury aspects hadagain in their protest against the truth of her gatheredimpression made her more or less their own yet the oddity mighthave been registered as small as compared to the other effectthat before they had gone much further she had with hercompanion to take account of this latter was simply the effectof their having by some tacit logic some queer inevitability quite dropped the idea of a continued pursuit they didn t sayso but it was on the line of giving up maggie s present thatthey practically proceeded the line of giving it up without morereference to it the prince s first reference was in fact quiteindependently made i hope you satisfied yourself before youhad done of what was the matter with that bowl no indeed i satisfied myself of nothing of nothing at leastbut that the more i looked at it the more i liked it and that ifyou weren t so unaccommodating this would be just the occasionfor your giving me the pleasure of accepting it he looked graver for her at this than he had looked all themorning do you propose it seriously without wishing to play mea trick she wondered what trick would it be he looked at her harder you mean you really don t know but know what why what s the matter with it you didn t see all the while she only continued however to stare how could you see out inthe street i saw before i went out it was because i saw that i did go out i didn t want to have another scene with you before that rascal and i judged you would presently guess for yourself is he a rascal charlotte asked his price is so moderate shewaited but a moment five pounds really so little five pounds he continued to look at her five pounds he might have been doubting her word but he was only itappeared gathering emphasis it would be dear to make a giftof at five shillings if it had cost you even but five pence iwouldn t take it from you then she asked what is the matter why it has a crack it sounded on his lips so sharp it had such an authority thatshe almost started while her colour at the word rose it wasas if he had been right though his assurance was wonderful youanswer for it without having looked i did look i saw the object itself it told its story nowonder it s cheap but it s exquisite charlotte as if with an interest in it nowmade even tenderer and stranger found herself moved to insist of course it s exquisite that s the danger then a lightvisibly came to her a light in which her friend suddenly andintensely showed the reflection of it as she smiled at him wasin her own face the danger i see is because you resuperstitious per dio i m superstitious a crack is a crack and an omen s anomen you d be afraid per bacco for your happiness for my happiness for your safety for my safety she just paused for your marriage for my marriage for everything she thought again thank goodness then that if there be a crackwe know it but if we may perish by cracks in things that wedon t know and she smiled with the sadness of it we cannever then give each other anything he considered but he met it ah but one does know i do atleast and by instinct i don t fail that will always protectme it was funny the way he said such things yet she liked him really the more for it they fell in for her with a general orrather with a special vision but she spoke with a mild despair what then will protect me where i m concerned i will from me at least you ve nothing tofear he now quite amiably responded anything you consent toaccept from me but he paused well well shall be perfect that s very fine she presently answered it s vain afterall for you to talk of my accepting things when you ll acceptnothing from me ah there better still he could meet her you attach animpossible condition that i mean of my keeping your gift so tomyself well she looked before him there at the condition then abruptly with a gesture she gave it up she had a headshake ofdisenchantment so far as the idea had appealed to her it allappeared too difficult oh my condition i don t hold to it you may cry it on the housetops anything i ever do ah well then this made he laughed all the difference but it was too late oh i don t care now i should have likedthe bowl but if that won t do there s nothing he considered this he took it in looking graver again butafter a moment he qualified yet i shall want some day to giveyou something she wondered at him what day the day you marry for you will marry you must seriously marry she took it from him but it determined in her the only words shewas to have uttered all the morning that came out as if aspring had been pressed to make you feel better well he replied frankly wonderfully it will but here headded is your hansom he had signalled the cab was charging she put out no hand fortheir separation but she prepared to get in before she did so however she said what had been gathering while she waited well i would marry i think to have something from you in allfreedom part secondviiadam verver at fawns that autumn sunday might have beenobserved to open the door of the billiard room with a certainfreedom might have been observed that is had there been aspectator in the field the justification of the push he hadapplied however and of the push equally sharp that to shuthimself in he again applied the ground of this energy wasprecisely that he might here however briefly find himselfalone alone with the handful of letters newspapers and otherunopened missives to which during and since breakfast he hadlacked opportunity to give an eye the vast square cleanapartment was empty and its large clear windows looked out intospaces of terrace and garden of park and woodland and shiningartificial lake of

tortuouscorridors investing him with an interest that makes ourattention tender indeed almost to compassion qualify hisachieved isolation for it may immediately be mentioned that thisamiable man bethought himself of his personal advantage ingeneral only when it might appear to him that other advantages those of other persons had successfully put in their claim itmay be mentioned also that he always figured other persons suchwas the law of his nature as a numerous array and that thoughconscious of but a single near tie one affection one dutydeepest rooted in his life it had never for many minutestogether been his portion not to feel himself surrounded andcommitted never quite been his refreshment to make out where themany coloured human appeal represented by gradations of tint diminishing concentric zones of intensity of importunity reallyfaded to the blessed impersonal whiteness for which his visionsometimes ached it shaded off the appeal he would haveadmitted that but he had as yet noted no point at which itpositively stopped thus had grown in him a little habit his innermost secret notconfided even to maggie though he felt she understood it as sheunderstood to his view everything thus had shaped itself theinnocent trick of occasionally making believe that he had noconscience or at least that blankness in the field of duty didreign for an hour a small game to which the few persons nearenough to have caught him playing it and of whom mrs assingham for instance was one attached indulgently that idea ofquaintness quite in fact that charm of the pathetic involved inthe preservation by an adult of one of childhood s toys when hetook a rare moment off he did so with the touching confessingeyes of a man of forty seven caught in the act of handling arelic of infancy sticking on the head of a broken soldier ortrying the lock of a wooden gun it was essentially in him theimitation of depravity which for amusement as might have been he practised keeping up in spite of practice he was stillimperfect for these so artlessly artful interludes werecondemned by the nature of the case to brevity he had fatallystamped himself it was his own fault a man who could beinterrupted with impunity the greatest of wonders moreover wasexactly in this that so interrupted a man should ever have got as the phrase was should above all have got so early to wherehe was it argued a special genius he was clearly a case ofthat the spark of fire the point of light sat somewhere in hisinward vagueness as a lamp before a shrine twinkles in the darkperspective of a church

scene of anunprecedented a miraculous white heat the receipt for producingwhich it was practically felt that the master of the forge couldnot have communicated even with the best intentions the essential pulse of the flame the very action of the cerebraltemperature brought to the highest point yet extraordinarilycontained these facts themselves were the immensity of theresult they were one with perfection of machinery they hadconstituted the kind of acquisitive power engendered and applied the necessary triumph of all operations a dim explanation ofphenomena once vivid must at all events for the moment sufficeus it being obviously no account of the matter to throw on ourfriend s amiability alone the weight of the demonstration of hiseconomic history amiability of a truth is an aid to success it has even been known to be the principle of largeaccumulations but the link for the mind is none the lessfatally missing between proof on such a scale of continuity ifof nothing more insolent in one field and accessibility todistraction in every other variety of imagination what is thatbut fatal in the world of affairs unless so disciplined as notto be distinguished from monotony mr verver then for a fresh full period a period betraying extraordinarily no wasted year had been inscrutably monotonous behind an iridescent cloud thecloud was his native envelope the soft looseness so to say ofhis temper and tone not directly expressive enough no doubt tofigure an amplitude of folds but of a quality unmistakable forsensitive feelers he was still reduced in fine to getting hisrare moments with himself by feigning a cynicism his realinability to maintain the pretence however had perhaps notoften been better instanced than by his acceptance of theinevitable to day his acceptance of it on the arrival at theend of a quarter of an hour of that element of obligation withwhich he had all the while known he must reckon a quarter of an hour of egoism was about as much as he taking one situation withanother usually got mrs rance opened the door moretentatively indeed than he himself had just done but on theother hand as if to make up for this she pushed forward evenmore briskly on seeing him than he had been moved to do on seeingnobody then with force it came home to him that he had definitely a week before established a precedent he did her atleast that justice it was a kind of justice he was always doingsomeone he had on the previous sunday liked to stop at home andhe had exposed himself thereby to be caught in the act to makethis possible that is mrs rance had only had to like to do thesame the trick was so easily played it had not occurred to himto plan in any way for her absence which would have destroyed somehow in principle the propriety of his own presence ifpersons under his roof hadn t a right not to go to church whatbecame for a fair mind of his own right his subtlest manoeuvrehad been simply to change from the library to the billiard room it being in the library that his guest or his daughter s or theguest of the miss lutches he scarce knew in which light toregard her had then and not unnaturally of course joined him it was urged on him by his memory of the duration of the visitshe had that time as it were paid him that the law ofrecurrence would already have got itself enacted she had spentthe whole morning with him was still there in the library whenthe others came back thanks to her having been tepid about theirtaking mr verver and she a turn outside it had been as if shelooked on that as a kind of subterfuge almost as a form ofdisloyalty yet what was it she had in mind what did she wish tomake of him beyond what she had already made a patient punctilious host mindful that she had originally arrived much asa stranger arrived not at all deliberately or yearninglyinvited so that one positively had her possiblesusceptibilities the more on one s conscience the miss lutches the sisters from the middle west were there as friends ofmaggie s friends of the earlier time but mrs rance was there or at least had primarily appeared only as a friend of the misslutches this lady herself was not of the middle west she rather insistedon it but of new jersey rhode island or delaware one of thesmallest and most intimate states he couldn t remember which though she insisted too on that it was not in him we may say itfor him to go so far as to wonder if their group were next to berecruited by some friend of her own and this partly because shehad struck him verily rather as wanting to get the miss lutchesthemselves away than to extend the actual circle and partly aswell as more essentially because such connection as he enjoyedwith the ironic question in general resided substantially less ina personal use of it than in the habit of seeing it as easy toothers he was so framed by nature as to be able to keep hisinconveniences separate from his resentments though indeed ifthe sum of these latter had at the most always been small thatwas doubtless in some degree a consequence of the fewness of theformer his greatest inconvenience he would have admitted hadhe analyzed was in finding it so taken for granted that as hehad money he had force it pressed upon him hard and all round assuredly this attribution of power everyone had need of one spower whereas one s own need at the best would have seemed tobe but some trick for not communicating it the effect of areserve so merely so meanly defensive would in most cases beyond question sufficiently discredit the cause wherefore though it was complicating to be perpetually treated as aninfinite agent the outrage was not the greatest of which a braveman might complain complaint besides was a luxury and hedreaded the imputation of greed the other the constantimputation that of being able to do would have no ground ifhe hadn t been to start with this was the point provablyluxurious his lips somehow were closed and by a springconnected moreover with the action of his eyes themselves thelatter showed him what he had done showed him where he had comeout quite at the top of his hill of difficulty the tall sharpspiral round which he had begun to wind his ascent at the age oftwenty and the apex of which was a platform looking down if onewould on the kingdoms of the earth and with standing room forbut half a dozen others his eyes in any case now saw mrs rance approach with aninstant failure to attach to the fact any grossness of avidity ofmrs rance s own or at least to descry any triumphant use evenfor the luridest impression of her intensity what was virtuallysupreme would be her vision of his having attempted by hisdesertion of the library to mislead her which in point of factbarely escaped being what he had designed it was not easy forhim in spite of accumulations fondly and funnily regarded as ofsystematic practice not now to be ashamed the one thingcomparatively easy would be to gloss over his course thebilliard room was not at the particular crisis either a naturalor a graceful place for the nominally main occupant of so large ahouse to retire to and this without prejudice either to thefact that his visitor wouldn t as he apprehended explicitlymake him a scene should she frankly denounce him for a sneak hewould simply go to pieces but he was after an instant notafraid of that wouldn t she rather as emphasising theircommunion accept and in a manner exploit the anomaly treat itperhaps as romantic or possibly even as comic show at leastthat they needn t mind even though the vast table draped inbrown holland thrust itself between them as an expanse of desertsand she couldn t cross the desert but she could and did beautifully get round it so that for him to convert it into anobstacle he would have had to cause himself as in some childishgame or unbecoming romp to be pursued to be genially hunted this last was a turn he was well aware the occasion should on noaccount take and there loomed before him for the mere moment the prospect of her fairly proposing that they should knock aboutthe balls that danger certainly it struck him he should managein some way to deal with why too for that matter had he needof defences material or other how was it a question of dangersreally to be called such the deep danger the only one that madehim as an idea positively turn cold would have been thepossibility of her seeking him in marriage of her bringing upbetween them that terrible issue here fortunately she waspowerless it being apparently so provable against her that shehad a husband in undiminished existence she had him it was true only in america only in texas innebraska in arizona or somewhere somewhere that at old fawnshouse in the county of kent scarcely counted as a definiteplace at all it showed somehow from afar as so lost soindistinct and illusory in the great alkali desert of cheapdivorce she had him even in bondage poor man had him incontempt had him in remembrance so imperfect as barely to assertitself but she had him none the less in existence unimpeached the miss lutches had seen him in the flesh as they had appearedeager to mention though when they were separately questionedtheir descriptions failed to tally he would be at the worst should it come to the worst mrs rance s difficulty and heserved therefore quite enough as the stout bulwark of anyoneelse this was in truth logic without a flaw yet it gave mr verver less comfort than it ought he feared not only danger hefeared the idea of danger or in other words feared hauntedly himself it was above all as a symbol that mrs rance actuallyrose before him a symbol of the supreme effort that he shouldhave sooner or later as he felt to make this effort would beto say no he lived in terror of having to he should be proposedto at a given moment it was only a question of time and then heshould have to do a thing that would be extremely disagreeable he almost wished on occasion that he wasn t so sure he would doit he knew himself however well enough not to doubt he knewcoldly quite bleakly where he would at the crisis draw theline it was maggie s marriage and maggie s finer happiness happy as he had supposed her before that had made thedifference he hadn t in the other time it now seemed to him had to think of such things they hadn t come up for him and itwas as if she positively had herself kept them down she hadonly been his child which she was indeed as much as ever butthere were sides on which she had protected him as if she weremore than a daughter she had done for him more than he knew much and blissfully as he always had known if she did atpresent more than ever through having what she called the changein his life to make up to him for his situation still all thesame kept pace with her activity his situation being simplythat there was more than ever to be done there had not yet been quite so much on all the showing assince their return from their twenty months in america as sincetheir settlement again in england experimental though it was and the consequent sense now quite established for him of adomestic air that had cleared and lightened producing theeffect for their common personal life of wider perspectives andlarge waiting spaces it was as if his son in law s presence even from before his becoming his son in law had somehow filledthe scene and blocked the future very richly and handsomely when all was said not at all inconveniently or in ways not tohave been desired inasmuch as though the prince his measure nowpractically taken was still pretty much the same big fact thesky had lifted the horizon receded the very foreground itselfexpanded quite to match him quite to keep everything incomfortable scale at first certainly their decent littleold time union maggie s and his own had resembled a good dealsome pleasant public square in the heart of an old city intowhich a great palladian church say something with a grandarchitectural front had suddenly been dropped so that the restof the place the space in front the way round outside to theeast end the margin of street and passage the quantity ofover arching heaven had been temporarily compromised not eventhen of a truth in a manner disconcerting given that is forthe critical or at least the intelligent eye the great styleof the facade and its high place in its class the phenomenonthat had since occurred whether originally to have beenpronounced calculable or not had not naturally been themiracle of a night but had taken place so gradually quietly easily that from this vantage of wide wooded fawns with itseighty rooms as they said with its spreading park with its acres and acres of garden and its majesty of artificial lake though that for a person so familiar with the great ones might be rather ridiculous no visibility of transition showed no violence of adjustment in retrospect emerged the palladianchurch was always there but the piazza took care of itself thesun stared down in his fulness the air circulated and thepublic not less the limit stood off the way round was easy theeast end was as fine in its fashion as the west and there werealso side doors for entrance between the two large monumental ornamental in their style as for all proper great churches bysome such process in fine had the prince for his father in law while remaining solidly a feature ceased to be at allominously a block mr verver it may further be mentioned had taken at no momentsufficient alarm to have kept in detail the record of hisreassurance but he would none the less not have been unable notreally have been indisposed to impart in confidence to the rightperson his notion of the history of the matter the rightperson it is equally distinct had not for this illumination been wanting but had been encountered in the form of fannyassingham not for the first time indeed admitted to hiscounsels and who would have doubtless at present in any case from plenitude of interest and with equal guarantees repeatedhis secret it all came then the great clearance from the oneprime fact that the prince by good fortune hadn t provedangular he clung to that description of his daughter s husbandas he often did to terms and phrases in the human the socialconnection that he had found for himself it was his way to havetimes of using these constantly as if they just then lighted theworld or his own path in it for him even when for some of hisinterlocutors they covered less ground it was true that withmrs assingham he never felt quite sure of the ground anythingcovered she disputed with him so little agreed with him somuch surrounded him with such systematic consideration suchpredetermined tenderness that it was almost which he had oncetold her in irritation as if she were nursing a sick baby hehad accused her of not taking him seriously and she hadreplied as from her it couldn t frighten him that she took himreligiously adoringly she had laughed again as she had laughedbefore on his producing for her that good right word about thehappy issue of his connection with the prince with an effect themore odd perhaps as she had not contested its value she couldn tof course however be at the best as much in love with hisdiscovery as he was himself he was so much so that he fairlyworked it to his own comfort came in fact sometimes nearpublicly pointing the moral of what might have occurred iffriction so to speak had occurred he pointed it frankly oneday to the personage in question mentioned to the prince theparticular justice he did him was even explicit as to the dangerthat in their remarkable relation they had thus escaped oh if he had been angular who could say what might then havehappened he spoke and it was the way he had spoken to mrs assingham too as if he grasped the facts without exception forwhich angularity stood it figured for him clearly as a final idea a conception of thelast vividness he might have been signifying by it the sharpcorners and hard edges all the stony pointedness the grandright geometry of his spreading palladian church just so he wasinsensible to no feature of the felicity of a contact that beguilingly almost confoundingly was a contact but withpractically yielding lines and curved surfaces you re round myboy he had said you re all you re variously andinexhaustibly round when you might by all the chances havebeen abominably square i m not sure for that matter he hadadded that you re not square in the general mass whetherabominably or not the abomination isn t a question for you reinveterately round that s what i mean in the detail it s thesort of thing in you that one feels or at least i do withone s hand say you had been formed all over in a lot of littlepyramidal

prince hadtaken the idea in his way for he was well accustomed by thistime to taking and nothing perhaps even could more haveconfirmed mr verver s account of his surface than the manner inwhich these

most differed from them and his father in law and his wife were after all only first among the peopleamong whom he had been living he was never even yet sure of how at this that or the other point he would strike them they feltremarkably so often things he hadn t meant and missed not lessremarkably and not less often things he had he had fallenback on his general explanation we haven t the same values bywhich he understood the same measure of importance his curves apparently were important because they had been unexpected or still more unconceived whereas when one had always as in hisrelegated old world taken curves and in much greater quantitiestoo for granted one was no more surprised at the resultingfeasibility of intercourse than one was surprised at beingupstairs in a

flaws in which casethey re to be had very cheap he had stopped short of theemphasis it would have given his joke to add that there had beencertainly no having him cheap and it was doubtless a mark of thegood taste practically reigning between them that mr verver hadnot on his side either taken up the opportunity it is thelatter s relation to such aspects however that now mostconcerns us and the

leaf long inerthad moved at a touch and eagerly reversed had made such a stirof the air as sent up into his face the very breath of the goldenisles to rifle the golden isles had on the spot become thebusiness of his future and with the sweetness of it what wasmost wondrous of all still more even in the thought than in theact the thought was that of the affinity of genius or at leastof taste with something in himself with the dormantintelligence of which he had thus almost violently become awareand that affected him as changing by a mere revolution of thescrew his whole intellectual plane he was equal somehow withthe great seers the invokers and encouragers of beauty and hedidn t after all perhaps dangle so far below the great producersand creators he had been nothing of that kind before toodecidedly too dreadfully not but now he saw why he had beenwhat he had why he had failed and fallen short even in hugesuccess now he read into his career in one single magnificentnight the immense meaning it had waited for it was during his first visit to europe after the death of hiswife when his daughter was ten years old that the light in hismind had so broken and he had even made out at that time why on an earlier occasion the journey of his honeymoon year it hadstill been closely covered he had bought then so far as hehad been able but he had bought almost wholly for the frail fluttered creature at his side who had had her fancies decidedly but all for the art then wonderful to both of them of the rue de la paix the costly authenticities of dressmakersand jewellers her flutter pale disconcerted ghost as sheactually was a broken white flower tied round almostgrotesquely for his present sense with a huge satin bow of theboulevard her flutter had been mainly that of ribbons frillsand fine fabrics all funny pathetic evidence for memory ofthe bewilderments overtaking them as a bridal pair confrontedwith opportunity he could wince fairly still as he rememberedthe sense in which the poor girl s pressure had under his fondencouragement indeed been exerted in favour of purchase andcuriosity these were wandering images out of the earlier dusk that threw her back for his pity into a past more remote thanhe liked their common past their young affection to appear it would have had to be admitted to an insistent criticism thatmaggie s mother all too strangely had not so much failed offaith as of the right application of it since she had exercisedit eagerly and restlessly made it a pretext for innocentperversities in respect to which philosophic time was at last toreduce all groans to gentleness and they had loved each other sothat his own intelligence on the higher line had temporarilypaid for it the futilities the enormities the depravities ofdecoration and ingenuity that before his sense was unsealed she had made him think lovely musing reconsidering little manthat he was and addicted to silent pleasures as he wasaccessible to silent pains he even sometimes wondered what wouldhave become of his intelligence in the sphere in which it was tolearn more and more exclusively to play if his wife s influenceupon it had not been in the strange scheme of things sopromptly removed would she have led him altogether attached ashe was to her into the wilderness of mere mistakes would shehave prevented him from ever scaling his vertiginous peak orwould she otherwise have been able to accompany him to thateminence where he might have pointed out to her as cortez tohis companions the revelation vouchsafed no companion of cortezhad presumably been a real lady mr verver allowed that historicfact to determine his inference viiiwhat was at all events not permanently hidden from him was atruth much less invidious about his years of darkness it was thestrange scheme of things again the years of darkness had beenneeded to render possible the years of light a wiser hand thanhe at first knew had kept him hard at acquisition of one sort asa perfect preliminary to acquisition of another and thepreliminary would have been weak and wanting if the good faith ofit had been less his comparative blindness had made the goodfaith which in its turn had made the soil propitious for theflower of the supreme idea he had had to like forging andsweating he had had to like polishing and piling up his arms they were things at least he had had to believe he liked just ashe had believed he liked transcendent calculation and imaginativegambling all for themselves the creation of interests thatwere the extinction of other interests the livid vulgarity even of getting in or getting out first that had of coursebeen so far from really the case with the supreme idea all thewhile growing and striking deep under everything in the warm rich earth he had stood unknowing he had walked and workedwhere it was buried and the fact itself the fact of hisfortune would have been a barren fact enough if the first sharptender shoot had never struggled into day there on one side wasthe ugliness his middle time had been spared there on the other from all the portents was the beauty with which his age mightstill be crowned he was happier doubtless than he deserved but that when one was happy at all it was easy to be he hadwrought by devious ways but he had reached the place and whatwould ever have been straighter in any man s life than his way now of occupying it it hadn t merely his plan all thesanctions of civilization it was positively civilizationcondensed concrete consummate set down by his hands as a houseon a rock a

greek temple wascompact a receptacle of treasures sifted to positive sanctity his spirit to day almost altogether lived making up as he wouldhave said for lost time and haunting the portico in

to do forthe production of his first effect foundations were laid andwalls were rising the structure of the shell all determined butraw haste was forbidden him in a connection so intimate with thehighest effects of patience and piety he should belie himself bycompleting without a touch at least of the majesty of delay amonument to the religion he wished to propagate the exemplarypassion the

he liked to mark that he needed on the matter in question instruction from no one on earth acouple of years of europe again of renewed nearness to changesand chances refreshed sensibility to the currents of the market would fall in with the consistency of wisdom the particularshade of enlightened conviction that he wished to observe itdidn t look like much for a whole family to hang about waiting they being now since the birth of his grandson a whole family and there was henceforth only one ground in all the world hefelt on which the question of appearance would ever really againcount for him he cared that a work of art of price should looklike the master to whom it might perhaps be deceitfullyattributed but he had ceased on the whole to know any matter ofthe rest of life by its looks he took life in general higher up the stream so far as he wasnot actually taking it as a collector he was taking it decidedly as a grandfather in the way of precious small pieceshe had handled nothing so precious as the principino hisdaughter s first born whose italian designation endlessly amusedhim and whom he could manipulate and dandle already almost tossand catch again as he couldn t a correspondingly rare morsel ofan earlier pate tendre he could take the small clutching childfrom his nurse s arms with an iteration grimly discountenanced in respect to their contents by the glass doors of highcabinets something clearly beatific in this new relation had moreover without doubt confirmed for him the sense that none ofhis silent answers to public detraction to local vulgarity hadever been so legitimately straight as the mere element ofattitude reduce it he said to that in his easy weeks atfawns the element of attitude was all he wanted of these weeks and he was enjoying it on the spot even more than he had hoped enjoying it in spite of mrs rance and the miss lutches in spiteof the small worry of his belief that fanny assingham had reallysomething for him that she was keeping back in spite of his fullconsciousness overflowing the cup like a wine too generouslypoured that if he had consented to marry his daughter andthereby to make as it were the difference what surrounded himnow was exactly consent vivified marriage demonstrated thedifference in fine definitely made he could call back hisprior his own wedded consciousness it was not yet out of rangeof vague reflection he had supposed himself above all he hadsupposed his wife as married as anyone could be and yet hewondered if their state had deserved the name or their unionworn the beauty in the degree to which the couple now before himcarried the matter in especial since the birth of their boy innew york the grand climax of their recent american period brought to so right an issue the happy pair struck him as havingcarried it higher deeper further to where it ceased to concernhis imagination at any rate to follow them extraordinary beyond question was one branch of his characteristic mutewonderment it characterised above all with its subject beforeit his modesty the strange dim doubt waking up for him at theend of the years of whether maggie s mother had after all beencapable of the maximum the maximum of tenderness he meant asthe terms existed for him the maximum of immersion in the factof being married maggie herself was capable maggie herself atthis season was exquisitely divinely the maximum such wasthe impression that positively holding off a little for thepractical the tactful consideration it inspired in him arespect for the beauty and sanctity of it almost amounting to awe such was the impression he daily received from her she was hermother oh yes but her mother and something more it becomingthus a new light for him and in such a curious way too thatanything more than her mother should prove at this time of daypossible he could live over again at almost any quiet moment the longprocess of his introduction to his present interests anintroduction that had depended all on himself like the cheek of the young man who approaches a boss without credentials orpicks up an acquaintance makes even a real friend by speakingto a passer in the street his real friend in all the business was to have been his own mind with which nobody had put him inrelation he had knocked at the door of that essentially privatehouse and his call in truth had not been immediately answered so that when after waiting and coming back he had at last gotin it was twirling his hat as an embarrassed stranger or trying his keys as a thief at night he had gained confidenceonly with time but when he had taken real possession of theplace it had been never again to come away all of which successrepresented it must be allowed his one principle of pride pride in the mere original spring pride in his money would havebeen pride in something that had come in comparison so easily the right ground for elation was difficulty mastered and hisdifficulty thanks to his modesty had been to believe in hisfacility this was the problem he had worked out to itssolution the solution that was now doing more than all else tomake his feet settle and his days flush and when he wished tofeel good as they said at american city he had but to retracehis immense development that was what the whole thing came backto that the development had not been somebody s else passingfalsely accepted too ignobly for his to think how servile hemight have been was absolutely to respect himself was in fact as much as he liked to admire himself as free the very finestspring that ever responded to his touch was always there topress the memory of his freedom as dawning upon him like asunrise all pink and silver during a winter divided betweenflorence rome and naples some three years after his wife sdeath it was the hushed daybreak of the roman revelation inparticular that he could usually best recover with the way thatthere above all where the princes and popes had been beforehim his divination of his faculty most went to his head he wasa plain american citizen staying at an hotel where sometimes for days together there were twenty others like him but nopope no prince of them all had read a richer meaning hebelieved into the character of the patron of art he was ashamedof them really if he wasn t afraid and he had on the wholenever so climbed to the tip top as in judging over a perusal ofhermann grimm where julius ii and leo x were placed by theirtreatment of michael angelo far below the plain americancitizen in the case at least in which this personage happenednot to be too plain to be adam verver going to our friend shead moreover some of the results of such comparisons maydoubtless be described as having stayed there his freedom tosee of which the comparisons were part what could it do butsteadily grow and grow it came perhaps even too much to stand to him for all freedom since for example it was as much there as ever at the very timeof mrs rance s conspiring against him at fawns with thebilliard room and the sunday morning on the occasion round whichwe have perhaps drawn our circle too wide mrs rance at leastcontrolled practically each other license of the present and thenear future the license to pass the hour as he would have foundconvenient the license to stop remembering for a little that though if proposed to and not only by this aspirant but by anyother he wouldn t prove foolish the proof of wisdom was nonethe less in such a fashion rather cruelly conditioned thelicense in especial to proceed from his letters to his journalsand insulate orientate himself afresh by the sound over hisgained interval of the many mouthed monster the exercise ofwhose lungs he so constantly stimulated mrs rance remained withhim till the others came back from church and it was by thattime clearer than ever that his ordeal when it should arrive would be really most unpleasant his impression this was thepoint took somehow the form not so much of her wanting to presshome her own advantage as of her building better than she knew that is of her symbolising with virtual unconsciousness his ownspecial deficiency his unfortunate lack of a wife to whomapplications could be referred the applications thecontingencies with which mrs rance struck him as potentiallybristling were not of a sort really to be met by one s self and the possibility of them when his visitor said or as good assaid i m restrained you see because of mr rance and alsobecause i m proud and refined but if it wasn t for mr rance andfor my refinement and my pride the possibility of them i say turned to a great murmurous rustle of a volume to fill thefuture a rustle of petticoats of scented many paged letters of voices as to which distinguish themselves as they might fromeach other it mattered little in what part of the resoundingcountry they had learned to make themselves prevail theassinghams and the miss lutches had taken the walk through thepark to the little old church on the property that ourfriend had often found himself wishing he were able to transport as it stood for its simple sweetness in a glass case to one ofhis exhibitory halls while maggie had induced her husband notinveterate in such practices to make with her by carriage thesomewhat longer pilgrimage to the nearest altar modest though ithappened to be of the faith her own as it had been hermother s and as mr verver himself had been loosely willing always to let it be taken for his without the solid ease ofwhich making the stage firm and smooth the drama of hermarriage might not have been acted out what at last appeared to have happened however was that thedivided parties coming back at the same moment had met outsideand then drifted together from empty room to room yet not inmere aimless quest of the pair of companions they had left athome the quest had carried them to the door of the billiard room and their appearance as it opened to admit them determined for adam verver in the oddest way in the world a newand sharp perception it was really remarkable this perceptionexpanded on the spot as a flower one of the strangest might at a breath have suddenly opened the breath for that matter was more than anything else the look in his daughter s eyes thelook with which he saw her take in exactly what had occurred inher absence mrs rance s pursuit of him to this remote locality the spirit and the very form perfectly characteristic of hisacceptance of the complication the seal set in short unmistakably on one of maggie s anxieties the anxiety it wastrue would have been even though not imparted separatelyshared for fanny assingham s face was by the same stroke notat all thickly veiled for him and a queer light of a colourquite to match fairly glittered in the four fine eyes of themiss lutches each of these persons counting out that is theprince and the colonel who didn t care and who didn t even seethat the others did knew something or had at any rate had heridea the idea precisely that this was what mrs rance artfully biding her time would do the special shade ofapprehension on the part of the miss lutches might indeed havesuggested the vision of an energy supremely asserted it wasdroll in truth if one came to that the position of the misslutches they had themselves brought they had guilelesslyintroduced mrs rance strong in the fact of mr rance s havingbeen literally beheld of them and it was now for them positively as if their handful of flowers since mrs rance wasa handful had been but the vehicle of a dangerous snake mr verver fairly felt in the air the miss lutches imputation inthe intensity of which really his own propriety might have beeninvolved that none the less was but a flicker what made the realdifference as i have hinted was his mute passage with maggie his daughter s anxiety alone had depths and it opened out forhim the wider that it was altogether new when in their commonpast when till this moment had she shown a fear howeverdumbly for his individual life they had had fears together just as they had had joys but all of hers at least had beenfor what equally concerned them here of a sudden was a questionthat concerned him alone and the soundless explosion of itsomehow marked a date he was on her mind he was even in amanner on her hands as a distinct thing that is from being where he had always been merely deep in her heart and in herlife too deep down as it were to be disengaged contrasted oropposed in short objectively presented but time finally haddone it their relation was altered he saw again thedifference lighted for her this marked it to himself and itwasn t a question simply of a mrs rance the more or the less for maggie too at a stroke almost beneficently their visitorhad from being an inconvenience become a sign they had madevacant by their marriage his immediate foreground his personalprecinct they being the princess and the prince they had maderoom in it for others so others had become aware he becameaware himself for that matter during the minute maggie stoodthere before speaking and with the sense moreover of what hesaw her see he had the sense of what she saw him this last itmay be added would have been his intensest perception had therenot the next instant been more for him in fanny assingham herface couldn t keep it from him she had seen on top ofeverything in her quick way what they both were seeing ixso much mute communication was doubtless all this time marvellous and we may confess to having perhaps read into thescene prematurely a critical character that took longer todevelop yet the quiet hour of reunion enjoyed that afternoon bythe father and the daughter did really little else than deal withthe elements definitely presented to each in the vibrationproduced by the return of the church goers nothing allusive nothing at all insistent passed between them either before orimmediately after luncheon except indeed so far as their failuresoon again to meet might be itself an accident charged withreference the hour or two after luncheon and on sundays withespecial rigour for one of the domestic reasons of which itbelonged to maggie quite multitudinously to take account werehabitually spent by the princess with her little boy in whoseapartment she either frequently found her father alreadyestablished or was sooner or later joined by him his visit tohis grandson at some hour or other held its place in his day against all interventions and this without counting hisgrandson s visits to him scarcely less ordered and timed andthe odd bits as he called them that they picked up togetherwhen they could communions snatched for the most part on theterrace in the gardens or the park while the principino withmuch pomp and circumstance of perambulator parasol fine laceover veiling and incorruptible female attendance took the air in the private apartments which occupying in the great housethe larger part of a wing of their own were not much more easilyaccessible than if the place had been a royal palace and thesmall child an heir apparent in the nursery of nurseries thetalk at these instituted times was always so prevailingly withor about the master of the scene that other interests and othertopics had fairly learned to avoid the slighting and inadequatenotice there taken of them they came in at the best but asinvolved in the little boy s future his past or hiscomprehensive present never getting so much as a chance to pleadtheir own merits or to complain of being neglected nothingperhaps in truth had done more than this united participationto confirm in the elder parties that sense of a life not onlyuninterrupted but more deeply associated more largely combined of which on adam verver s behalf we have made some mention itwas of course an old story and a familiar idea that a beautifulbaby could take its place as a new link between a wife and ahusband but maggie and her father had with every ingenuity converted the precious creature into a link between a mamma and agrandpapa the principino for a chance spectator of thisprocess might have become by an untoward stroke a haplesshalf orphan with the place of immediate male parent swept bareand open to the next nearest sympathy they had no occasion thus the conjoined worshippers to talk ofwhat the prince might be or might do for his son the sum ofservice in his absence so completely filled itself out it wasnot in the least moreover that there was doubt of him for hewas conspicuously addicted to the manipulation of the child inthe frank italian way at such moments as he judged discreet inrespect to other claims conspicuously indeed that is formaggie who had more occasion on the whole to speak to herhusband of the extravagance of her father than to speak to herfather of the extravagance of her husband adam verver had allround in this connection his own serenity he was sure of hisson in law s auxiliary admiration admiration he meant of hisgrand son since to begin with what else had been at work butthe instinct or it might fairly have been the tradition of thelatter s making the child so solidly beautiful as to have to beadmired what contributed most to harmony in this play ofrelations however was the way the young man seemed to leave itto be gathered that tradition for tradition the grandpapa s ownwas not in any estimate to go for nothing a tradition orwhatever it was that had flowered prelusively in the princessherself well amerigo s very discretions were his way of takingaccount of it his discriminations in respect to his heir were in fine not more angular than any others to be observed in him and mr verver received perhaps from no source so distinct animpression of being for him an odd and important phenomenon as hereceived from this impunity of appropriation these unchallengednursery hours it was as if the grandpapa s special show of thecharacter were but another side for the observer to study another item for him to note it came back this latter personageknew to his own previous perception that of the prince sinability in any matter in which he was concerned to conclude the idiosyncrasy for him at each stage had to bedemonstrated on which however he admirably accepted it thislast was after all the point he really worked poor young man for acceptance since he worked so constantly for comprehension and how when you came to that could you know that a horsewouldn t shy at a brass band in a country road because itdidn t shy at a traction engine it might have been brought up totraction engines without having been brought up to brass bands little by little thus from month to month the prince waslearning what his wife s father had been brought up to and nowit could be checked off he had been brought up to the romanticview of principini who would have thought it and where would itall stop the only fear somewhat sharp for mr verver was acertain fear of disappointing him for strangeness he felt thatthe evidence he offered thus viewed was too much on thepositive side he didn t know he was learning and it was funnyfor him to how many things he had been brought up if the princecould only strike something to which he hadn t this wouldn t itseemed to him ruffle the smoothness and yet might a little add to the interest what was now clear at all events for the father and thedaughter was their simply knowing they wanted for the time tobe together at any cost as it were and their necessity soworked in them as to bear them out of the house in a quarterhidden from that in which their friends were gathered and causethem to wander unseen unfollowed along a covered walk in the old garden as it was called old with an antiquity of formalthings high box and shaped yew and expanses of brick wall thathad turned at once to purple and to pink they went out of a doorin the wall a door that had a slab with a date set above it but in the old multiplied lettering and then had beforethem a small white gate intensely white and clean amid all thegreenness through which they gradually passed to where some ofthe grandest trees spaciously clustered and where they would findone of the quietest places a bench had been placed long ago beneath a great oak that helped to crown a mild eminence and theground sank away below it to rise again opposite at a distancesufficient to enclose the solitude and figure a bosky horizon summer blissfully was with them yet and the low sun made asplash of light where it pierced the looser shade maggie comingdown to go out had brought a parasol which as over hercharming bare head she now handled it gave with the big strawhat that her father in these days always wore a good deal tippedback definite intention to their walk they knew the bench itwas sequestered they had praised it for that together before and liked the word and after they had begun to linger there theycould have smiled if they hadn t been really too serious and ifthe question hadn t so soon ceased to matter over the probablewonder of the others as to what would have become of them the extent to which they enjoyed their indifference to anyjudgment of their want of ceremony what did that of itself speakbut for the way that as a rule they almost equally had otherson their mind they each knew that both were full of thesuperstition of not hurting but might precisely have beenasking themselves asking in fact each other at this moment whether that was to be after all the last word of theirconscientious development certain it was at all events that in addition to the assinghams and the lutches and mrs rance theattendance at tea just in the right place on the west terrace might perfectly comprise the four or five persons among them thevery pretty the typically irish miss maddock vaunted announcedand now brought from the couple of other houses near enough oneof these the minor residence of their proprietor established thriftily while he hired out his ancestral home within sightand sense of his profit it was not less certain either that for once in a way the group in question must all take the caseas they found it fanny assingham at any time for that matter might perfectly be trusted to see mr verver and his daughter tosee their reputation for a decent friendliness through anymomentary danger might be trusted even to carry off theirabsence for amerigo for amerigo s possible funny italiananxiety amerigo always being as the princess was well aware conveniently amenable to this friend s explanations beguilements reassurances and perhaps in fact rather more thanless dependent on them as his new life since that was his ownname for it opened out it was no secret to maggie it wasindeed positively a public joke for her that she couldn texplain as mrs assingham did and that the prince likingexplanations liking them almost as if he collected them in themanner of book plates or postage stamps for themselves hisrequisition of this luxury had to be met he didn t seem to wantthem as yet for use rather for ornament and amusement innocentamusement of the kind he most fancied and that was socharacteristic of his blessed beautiful general slightlyindolent lack of more dissipated or even just of moresophisticated tastes however that might be the dear woman had come to be frankly andgaily recognised and not least by herself as filling in theintimate little circle an office that was not always a sinecure it was almost as if she had taken with her kind melancholycolonel at her heels a responsible engagement to be withincall as it were for all those appeals that sprang out of talk that sprang not a little doubtless too out of leisure itnaturally led her position in the household as she called it to considerable frequency of presence to visits from the goodcouple freely repeated and prolonged and not so much as underform of protest she was there to keep him quiet it wasamerigo s own description of her influence and it would onlyhave needed a more visible disposition to unrest in himto make the account perfectly fit fanny herself limited indeed she minimised her office you didn t need a jailor shecontended for a domesticated lamb tied up with pink ribbon thiswas not an animal to be controlled it was an animal to be atthe most educated she admitted accordingly that she waseducative which maggie was so aware that she herself inevitably wasn t so it came round to being true that what shewas most in charge of was his mere intelligence this left goodness knew plenty of different calls for maggie to meet in acase in which so much pink ribbon as it might be symbolicallynamed was lavished on the creature what it all amounted to atany rate was that mrs assingham would be keeping him quiet now while his wife and his father in law carried out their own littlefrugal picnic quite moreover doubtless not much less neededlyin respect to the members of the circle that were with them therethan in respect to the pair they were missing almost for thefirst time it was present to maggie that the prince could bear when he was with his wife almost any queerness on the part ofpeople strange english types who bored him beyond convenience by being so little as he himself was for this was one of theways in which a wife was practically sustaining but she was aspositively aware that she hadn t yet learned to see him asmeeting such exposure in her absence how did he move and talk how above all did he or how would he look he who with his sonobly handsome face could look such wonderful things in case ofbeing left alone with some of the subjects of his wonder therewere subjects for wonder among these very neighbours only maggieherself had her own odd way which didn t moreover the leastirritate him of really liking them in proportion as they couldstrike her as strange it came out in her by heredity he amusedhimself with declaring this love of chinoiseries but sheactually this evening didn t mind he might deal with her chineseas he could maggie indeed would always have had for such moments had theyoftener occurred the impression made on her by a word of mrs assingham s a word referring precisely to that appetite inamerigo for the explanatory which we have just found in our path it wasn t that the princess could be indebted to another person even to so clever a one as this friend for seeing anything inher husband that she mightn t see unaided but she had ever hitherto been of a nature to accept with modest gratitude anybetter description of a felt truth than her little limits terribly marked she knew in the direction of saying the rightthings enabled her to make thus it was at any rate that shewas able to live more or less in the light of the fact expressedso lucidly by their common comforter the fact that the princewas saving up for some very mysterious but very fine eventualpurpose all the wisdom all the answers to his questions allthe impressions and generalisations he gathered putting themaway and packing them down because he wanted his great gun to beloaded to the brim on the day he should decide to let it off hewanted first to make sure of the whole of the subject that wasunrolling itself before him after which the innumerable facts hehad collected would find their use he knew what he was about trust him at last therefore to make and to some effect his bignoise and mrs assingham had repeated that he knew what he wasabout it was the happy form of this assurance that had remainedwith maggie it could always come in for her that amerigo knewwhat he was about he might at moments seem vague seem absent seem even bored this when away from her father with whom itwas impossible for him to appear anything but respectfullyoccupied he let his native gaiety go in outbreaks of song oreven of quite whimsical senseless sound either expressive ofintimate relaxation or else fantastically plaintive he might attimes reflect with the frankest lucidity on the circumstance thatthe case was for a good while yet absolutely settled in regard towhat he still had left at home of his very own in regard tothe main seat of his affection the house in rome the big blackpalace the palazzo nero as he was fond of naming it and alsoon the question of the villa in the sabine hills which she had at the time of their engagement seen and yearned over and thecastello proper described by him always as the perched place that had as she knew formerly stood up on the pedestal of itsmountain slope showing beautifully blue from afar as the headand front of the princedom he might rejoice in certain moodsover the so long estranged state of these properties not indeedall irreclaimably alienated but encumbered with unending leasesand charges with obstinate occupants with impossibilities ofuse all without counting the cloud of mortgages that had fromfar back buried them beneath the ashes of rage and remorse ashroud as thick as the layer once resting on the towns at thefoot of vesuvius and actually making of any present restorativeeffort a process much akin to slow excavation just so he mightwith another turn of his humour almost wail for these brightestspots of his lost paradise declaring that he was an idiot not tobe able to bring himself to face the sacrifices sacrificesresting if definitely anywhere with mr verver necessary forwinning them back one of the most comfortable things between the husband and thewife meanwhile one of those easy certitudes they could be merelygay about was that she never admired him so much or so foundhim heartbreakingly handsome clever irresistible in the verydegree in which he had originally and fatally dawned upon her aswhen she saw other women reduced to the same passive pulp thathad then begun once for all to constitute her substance therewas really nothing they had talked of together with more intimateand familiar pleasantry than of the license and privilege theboundless happy margin thus established for each she going sofar as to put it that even should he some day get drunk and beather the spectacle of him with hated rivals would after nomatter what extremity always for the sovereign charm of it charm of it in itself and as the exhibition of him that mostdeeply moved her suffice to bring her round what wouldtherefore be more open to him than to keep her in love with him he agreed with all his heart at these light moments that hiscourse wouldn t then be difficult inasmuch as so simplyconstituted as he was on all the precious question and whyshould he be ashamed of it he knew but one way with the fair they had to be fair and he was fastidious and particular hisstandard was high but when once this was the case what relationwith them was conceivable what relation was decent rudimentary properly human but that of a plain interest in the fairness hisinterest she always answered happened not to be plain andplainness all round had little to do with the matter which wasmarked on the contrary by the richest variety of colour butthe working basis at all events had been settled the missmaddocks of life been assured of their importance for him howconveniently assured maggie to take him too into the joke hadmore than once gone so far as to mention to her father since itfell in easily with the tenderness of her disposition to remembershe might occasionally make him happy by an intimate confidence this was one of her rules full as she was of little rules considerations provisions there were things she of coursecouldn t tell him in so many words about amerigo and herself andabout their happiness and their union and their deepest depths andthere were other things she needn t but there were also thosethat were both true and amusing both communicable and real andof these with her so conscious so delicately cultivated schemeof conduct as a daughter she could make her profit at will a pleasant hush for that matter had fallen on most of theelements while she lingered apart with her companion itinvolved this serenity innumerable complete assumptions sinceso ordered and so splendid a rest all the tokens spreadingabout them of confidence solidly supported might have suggestedfor persons of poorer pitch the very insolence of facility still they weren t insolent they weren t our pair couldreflect they were only blissful and grateful and personallymodest not ashamed of knowing with competence when greatthings were great when good things were good and when safethings were safe and not therefore placed below their fortuneby timidity which would have been as bad as being below it byimpudence worthy of it as they were and as each appears underour last possible analysis to have wished to make the other feelthat they were what they most finally exhaled into the eveningair as their eyes mildly met may well have been a kind ofhelplessness in their felicity their rightness thejustification of everything something they so felt the pulseof sat there with them but they might have been askingthemselves a little blankly to what further use they couldput anything so perfect they had created and nursed andestablished it they had housed it here in dignity and crowned itwith comfort but mightn t the moment possibly count for them orcount at least for us while we watch them with their fate allbefore them as the dawn of the discovery that it doesn t alwaysmeet all contingencies to be right otherwise why should maggiehave found a word of definite doubt the expression of the finepang determined in her a few hours before rise after a time toher lips she took so for granted moreover her companion sintelligence of her doubt that the mere vagueness of her questioncould say it all what is it after all that they want to do toyou they were for the princess too the hovering forces ofwhich mrs rance was the symbol and her father only smilingback now at his ease took no trouble to appear not to know whatshe meant what she meant when once she had spoken could comeout well enough though indeed it was nothing after they hadcome to the point that could serve as ground for a greatdefensive campaign the waters of talk spread a little andmaggie presently contributed an idea in saying what has reallyhappened is that the proportions for us are altered heaccepted equally for the time this somewhat cryptic remark hestill failed to challenge her even when she added that itwouldn t so much matter if he hadn t been so terribly young heuttered a sound of protest only when she went to declare that sheought as a daughter in common decency to have waited yet bythat time she was already herself admitting that she should havehad to wait long if she waited that is till he was old butthere was a way since you are an irresistible youth we ve gotto face it that somehow is what that woman has made me feel there ll be others xto talk of it thus appeared at last a positive relief to him yes there ll be others but you ll see me through she hesitated do you mean if you give in oh no through my holding out maggie waited again but when she spoke it had an effect ofabruptness why should you hold out forever he gave none the less no start and this as from the habit oftaking anything taking everything from her as harmonious butit was quite written upon him too for that matter that holdingout wouldn t be so very completely his natural or at any ratehis acquired form his appearance would have testified that hemight have to do so a long time for a man so greatly beset thisappearance that is spoke but little as yet of shortremainders and simplified senses and all in spite of his being asmall spare slightly stale person deprived of the generalprerogative of presence it was not by mass or weight or vulgarimmediate quantity that he would in the future any more than hehad done in the past insist or resist or prevail there was evensomething in him that made his position on any occasion madehis relation to any scene or to any group a matter of the backof the stage of an almost visibly conscious want of affinitywith the footlights he would have figured less than anything thestage manager or the author of the play who most occupy theforeground he might be at the best the financial backer watching his interests from the wing but in rather confessedignorance of the mysteries of mimicry barely taller than hisdaughter he pressed at no point on the presumed propriety of hisgreater stoutness he had lost early in life much of his crisp closely curling hair the fineness of which was repeated in asmall neat beard too compact to be called full though wornequally as for a mark where other marks were wanting on lip andcheek and chin his neat colourless face provided with themerely indispensable features suggested immediately for adescription that it was clear and in this manner somewhatresembled a small decent room clean swept and unencumbered withfurniture but drawing a particular advantage as might presentlybe noted from the outlook of a pair of ample and uncurtainedwindows there was something in adam verver s eyes that bothadmitted the morning and the evening in unusual quantities andgave the modest area the outward extension of a view that was big even when restricted to stars deeply and changeably blue though not romantically large they were yet youthfully almoststrangely beautiful with their ambiguity of your scarce knowingif they most carried their possessor s vision out or most openedthemselves to your own whatever you might feel they stamped theplace with their importance as the house agents say so that onone side or the other you were never out of their range weremoving about for possible community opportunity the sight ofyou scarce knew what either before them or behind them if otherimportances not to extend the question kept themselves down they were in no direction less obtruded than in that of ourfriend s dress adopted once for all as with a sort of sumptuaryscruple he wore every day of the year whatever the occasion the same little black cut away coat of the fashion of hisyounger time he wore the same cool looking trousers chequeredin black and white the proper harmony with which heinveterately considered was a sprigged blue satin necktie and over his concave little stomach quaintly indifferent to climatesand seasons a white duck waistcoat should you really he nowasked like me to marry he spoke as if coming from hisdaughter herself it might be an idea which for that matter hewould be ready to carry out should she definitely say so definite however just yet she was not prepared to be thoughit seemed to come to her with force as she thought that therewas a truth in the connection to utter what i feel is thatthere is somehow something that used to be right and that i vemade wrong it used to be right that you hadn t married and thatyou didn t seem to want to it used also she continued to makeout to seem easy for the question not to come up that s whati ve made different it does come up it will come up you don t think i can keep it down mr verver s tone wascheerfully pensive well i ve given you by my move all the trouble of having to he liked the tenderness of her idea and it made him as she satnear him pass his arm about her i guess i don t feel as if youhad moved very far you ve only moved next door well she continued i don t feel as if it were fair for mejust to have given you a push and left you so if i ve made thedifference for you i must think of the difference then what darling he indulgently asked do you think that s just what i don t yet know but i must find out we mustthink together as we ve always thought what i mean she wenton after a moment is that it strikes me that i ought to atleast offer you some alternative i ought to have worked one outfor you an alternative to what well to your simply missing what you ve lost without anythingbeing done about it but what have i lost she thought a minute as if it were difficult to say yet as ifshe more and more saw it well whatever it was that before kept us from thinking and kept you really as you might say inthe market it was as if you couldn t be in the market when youwere married to me or rather as if i kept people off innocently by being married to you now that i m married to someone else you re as in consequence married to nobody thereforeyou may be married to anybody to everybody people don t see whyyou shouldn t be married to them isn t it enough of a reason he mildly inquired that i don twant to be it s enough of a reason yes but to be enough of a reason ithas to be too much of a trouble i mean for you it has to be toomuch of a fight you ask me what you ve lost maggie continuedto explain the not having to take the trouble and to make thefight that s what you ve lost the advantage the happiness ofbeing just as you were because i was just as i was that swhat you miss so that you think her father presently said that i hadbetter get married just in order to be as i was before the detached tone of it detached as if innocently to amuse herby showing his desire to accommodate was so far successful as todraw from her gravity a short light laugh well what i don twant you to feel is that if you were to i shouldn t understand ishould understand that s all said the princess gently her companion turned it pleasantly over you don t go so far asto wish me to take somebody i don t like ah father she sighed you know how far i go how far i couldgo but i only wish that if you ever should like anybody you maynever doubt of my feeling how i ve brought you to it you llalways know that i know that it s my fault you mean he went on in his contemplative way that it will beyou who ll take the consequences maggie just considered i ll leave you all the good ones buti ll take the bad well that s handsome he emphasised his sense of it by drawingher closer and holding her more tenderly it s about all i couldexpect of you so far as you ve wronged me therefore we ll callit square i ll let you know in time if i see a prospect of yourhaving to take it up but am i to understand meanwhile he soonwent on that ready as you are to see me through my collapse you re not ready or not as ready to see me through myresistance i ve got to be a regular martyr before you ll beinspired she demurred at his way of putting it why if you like it youknow it won t be a collapse then why talk about seeing me through at all i shall onlycollapse if i do like it but what i seem to feel is that i don twant to like it that is he amended unless i feel surer i dothan appears very probable i don t want to have to think i likeit in a case when i really shan t i ve had to do that in somecases he confessed when it has been a question of otherthings i don t want he wound up to be made to make amistake ah but it s too dreadful she returned that you should evenhave to fear or just nervously to dream that you may be whatdoes that show after all she asked but that you do really well within feel a want what does it show but that you re trulysusceptible well it may show that he defended himself against nothing but it shows also i think that charming women are in the kindof life we re leading now numerous and formidable maggie entertained for a moment the proposition under cover ofwhich however she passed quickly from the general to theparticular do you feel mrs rance to be charming well i feel her to be formidable when they cast a spell itcomes to the same thing i think she d do anything oh well i d help you the princess said with decision asagainst her if that s all you require it s too funny she wenton before he again spoke that mrs rance should be here at all but if you talk of the life we lead much of it is altogether i m bound to say too funny the thing is maggie developedunder this impression that i don t think we lead as regardsother people any life at all we don t at any rate it seems tome lead half the life we might and so it seems i think toamerigo so it seems also i m sure to fanny assingham mr verver as if from due regard for these persons considered alittle what life would they like us to lead oh it s not a question i think on which they quite feeltogether she thinks dear fanny that we ought to be greater greater he echoed it vaguely and amerigo too you say ah yes her reply was prompt but amerigo doesn t mind hedoesn t care i mean what we do it s for us he considers tosee things exactly as we wish fanny herself maggie pursued thinks he s magnificent magnificent i mean for takingeverything as it is for accepting the social limitations ofour life for not missing what we don t give him mr verver attended then if he doesn t miss it his magnificenceis easy it is easy that s exactly what i think if there were things hedid miss and if in spite of them he were always sweet then nodoubt he would be a more or less unappreciated hero he could bea hero he will be one if it s ever necessary but it will beabout something better than our dreariness i know theprincess declared where he s magnificent and she rested aminute on that she ended however as she had begun we re not all the same committed to anything stupid if we ought to begrander as fanny thinks we can be grander there s nothing toprevent is it a strict moral obligation adam verver inquired no it s for the amusement for whose for fanny s own for everyone s though i dare say fanny s would be a largepart she hesitated she had now it might have appeared something more to bring out which she finally produced foryours in particular say if you go into the question she evenbravely followed it up i haven t really after all had tothink much to see that much more can be done for you than isdone mr verver uttered an odd vague sound don t you think a gooddeal is done when you come out and talk to me this way ah said his daughter smiling at him we make too much ofthat and then to explain that s good and it s natural butit isn t great we forget that we re as free as air well that s great mr verver pleaded great if we act on it not if we don t she continued to smile and he took her smile wondering again alittle by this time however struck more and more by anintensity in it that belied a light tone what do you want hedemanded to do to me and he added as she didn t say you vegot something in your mind it had come to him within the minutethat from the beginning of their session there she had beenkeeping something back and that an impression of this had morethan once in spite of his general theoretic respect for herpresent right to personal reserves and mysteries almost ceasedto be vague in him there had been from the first something inher anxious eyes in the way she occasionally lost herself thatit would perfectly explain he was therefore now quite sure you ve got something up your sleeve she had a silence that made him right well when i tell youyou ll understand it s only up my sleeve in the sense of beingin a letter i got this morning all day yes it has been in mymind i ve been asking myself if it were quite the right moment or in any way fair to ask you if you could stand just nowanother woman it relieved him a little yet the beautiful consideration of hermanner made it in a degree portentous stand one well mind her coming he stared then he laughed it depends on who she is there you see i ve at all events been thinking whether you dtake this particular person but as a worry the more whether that is you d go so far with her in your notion of having to bekind he gave at this the quickest shake to his foot how far would shego in her notion of it well his daughter returned you know how far in a generalway charlotte stant goes charlotte is she coming she writes me practically that she d like to if we re so goodas to ask her mr verver continued to gaze but rather as if waiting for more then as everything appeared to have come his expression had adrop if this was all it was simple then why in the world not maggie s face lighted anew but it was now another light itisn t a want of tact to ask her to propose it to you that i should ask her he put the question as an effect of his remnant of vagueness butthis had also its own effect maggie wondered an instant afterwhich as with a flush of recognition she took it up it wouldbe too beautiful if you would this clearly had not been her first idea the chance of hiswords had prompted it do you mean write to her myself yes it would be kind it would be quite beautiful of you thatis of course said maggie if you sincerely can he appeared to wonder an instant why he sincerely shouldn t andindeed for that matter where the question of sincerity came in this virtue between him and his daughter s friend had surelybeen taken for granted my dear child he returned i don tthink i m afraid of charlotte well that s just what it s lovely to have from you from themoment you re not the least little bit i ll immediately inviteher but where in the world is she he spoke as if he had notthought of charlotte nor so much as heard her name pronounced for a very long time he quite in fact amicably almost amusedly woke up to her she s in brittany at a little bathing place with some people idon t know she s always with people poor dear she rather hasto be even when as is sometimes the case they re people shedoesn t immensely like well i guess she likes us said adam verver yes fortunatelyshe likes us and if i wasn t afraid of spoiling it for you maggie added i d even mention that you re not the one of ournumber she likes least why should that spoil it for me oh my dear you know what else have we been talking about itcosts you so much to be liked that s why i hesitated to tell youof my letter he stared a moment as if the subject had suddenly grown out ofrecognition but charlotte on other visits never used to costme anything no only her keep maggie smiled then i don t think i mind her keep if that s all theprincess however it was clear wished to be thoroughlyconscientious well it may not be quite all if i think of itsbeing pleasant to have her it s because she will make adifference well what s the harm in that if it s but a difference for thebetter ah then there you are and the princess showed in her smileher small triumphant wisdom if you acknowledge a possibledifference for the better we re not after all so tremendouslyright as we are i mean we re not as satisfied and amused we dosee there are ways of being grander but will charlotte stant her father asked with surprise makeus grander maggie on this looking at him well had a remarkable reply yes i think really grander he thought for if this was a sudden opening he wished but themore to meet it because she s so handsome no father and the princess was almost solemn because she sso great great great in nature in character in spirit great in life so mr verver echoed what has she done in life well she has been brave and bright said maggie that mayn tsound like much but she has been so in the face of things thatmight well have made it too difficult for many other girls shehasn t a creature in the world really that is nearly belongingto her only acquaintances who in all sorts of ways make use ofher and distant relations who are so afraid she ll make use ofthem that they seldom let her look at them mr verver was struck and as usual to some purpose if we gether here to improve us don t we too then make use of her it pulled the princess up however but an instant we re old old friends we do her good too i should always even at theworst speaking for myself admire her still more than i usedher i see that always does good maggie hesitated certainly she knows it she knows i mean how great i think her courage and her cleverness she s notafraid not of anything and yet she no more ever takes a libertywith you than if she trembled for her life and then she sinteresting which plenty of other people with plenty of othermerits never are a bit in which fine flicker of visionthe truth widened to the princess s view i myself of coursedon t take liberties but then i do always by nature tremblefor my life that s the way i live oh i say love her father vaguely murmured yes i live in terror she insisted i m a small creepingthing you ll not persuade me that you re not as good as charlottestant he still placidly enough remarked i may be as good but i m not so great and that s what we retalking about she has a great imagination she has in everyway a great attitude she has above all a great conscience more perhaps than ever in her life before maggie addressed herfather at this moment with a shade of the absolute in her tone she had never come so near telling him what he should take itfrom her to believe she has only twopence in the world butthat has nothing to do with it or rather indeed she quicklycorrected herself it has everything for she doesn t care inever saw her do anything but laugh at her poverty her life hasbeen harder than anyone knows it was moreover as if thus unprecedentedly positive his childhad an effect upon him that mr verver really felt as a newthing why then haven t you told me about her before well haven t we always known i should have thought he submitted that we had alreadypretty well sized her up certainly we long ago quite took her for granted but thingschange with time and i seem to know that after this interval i m going to like her better than ever i ve lived more myself i m older and one judges better yes i m going to see incharlotte said the princess and speaking now as with high andfree expectation more than i ve ever seen then i ll try to do so too she was it came back to mr ververmore the one of your friends i thought the best for you his companion however was so launched in her permitted libertyof appreciation that she for the moment scarce heard him she waslost in the case she made out the vision of the different waysin which charlotte had distinguished herself she would have liked for instance i m sure she would have likedextremely to marry and nothing in general is more ridiculous even when it has been pathetic than a woman who has tried andhas not been able it had all mr verver s attention she has tried she has seen cases where she would have liked to but she has not been able well there are more cases in europe in which it doesn t cometo girls who are poor than in which it does come to them especially said maggie with her continued competence whenthey re americans well her father now met her and met her cheerfully on allsides unless you mean he suggested that when the girls areamerican there are more cases in which it comes to the rich thanto the poor she looked at him good humouredly that may be but i m notgoing to be smothered in my case it ought to make me if i werein danger of being a fool all the nicer to people likecharlotte it s not hard for me she practically explained notto be ridiculous unless in a very different way i might easilybe ridiculous i suppose by behaving as if i thought i had donea great thing charlotte at any rate has done nothing andanyone can see it and see also that it s rather strange and yetno one no one not awfully presumptuous or offensive would like or would dare to treat her just as she is as anything butquite right that s what it is to have something about you thatcarries things off mr verver s silence on this could only be a sign that she hadcaused her story to interest him though the sign when he spokewas perhaps even sharper and is it also what you mean bycharlotte s being great well said maggie it s one of her ways but she has many again for a little her father considered and who is it she hastried to marry maggie on her side as well waited as if to bring it out witheffect but she after a minute either renounced or encountered anobstacle i m afraid i m not sure then how do you know well i don t know and qualifying again she was earnestlyemphatic i only make it out for myself but you must make it out about someone in particular she had another pause i don t think i want even for myself toput names and times to pull away any veil i ve an idea therehas been more than once somebody i m not acquainted with andneedn t be or want to be in any case it s all over and beyondgiving her credit for everything it s none of my business mr verver deferred yet he discriminated i don t see how youcan give credit without knowing the facts can t i give it generally for dignity dignity i mean inmisfortune you ve got to postulate the misfortune first well said maggie i can do that isn t it always a misfortuneto be when you re so fine so wasted and yet she went on not to wail about it not to look even as if you knew it mr verver seemed at first to face this as a large question andthen after a little solicited by another view to let theappeal drop well she mustn t be wasted we won t at least havewaste it produced in maggie s face another gratitude then dear sir that s all i want and it would apparently have settled their question and endedtheir talk if her father had not after a little shown thedisposition to revert how many times are you supposing that shehas tried once more at this and as if she hadn t been couldn t be hatedto be in such delicate matters literal she was moved toattenuate oh i don t say she absolutely ever tried he looked perplexed but if she has so absolutely failed whatthen had she done she has suffered she has done that and the princess added she has loved and she has lost mr verver however still wondered but how many times maggie hesitated but it cleared up once is enough enough that is for one to be kind to her her father listened yet not challenging only as with a need ofsome basis on which under these new lights his bounty could befirm but has she told you nothing ah thank goodness no he stared then don t young women tell because you mean it s just what they re supposed to do shelooked at him flushed again now with which after anotherhesitation do young men tell she asked he gave a short laugh how do i know my dear what young mendo then how do i know father what vulgar girls do i see i see he quickly returned but she spoke the next moment as if she might odiously havebeen sharp what happens at least is that where there s a greatdeal of pride there s a great deal of silence i don t know iadmit what i should do if i were lonely and sore for whatsorrow to speak of have i ever had in my life i don t knoweven if i m proud it seems to me the question has never come upfor me oh i guess you re proud mag her father cheerfullyinterposed i mean i guess you re proud enough well then i hope i m humble enough too i might at all events for all i know be abject under a blow how can i tell do yourealise father that i ve never had the least blow he gave her a long quiet look who should realise if i don t well you ll realise when i have one she exclaimed with ashort laugh that resembled as for good reasons his own of aminute before i wouldn t in any case have let her tell me whatwould have been dreadful to me for such wounds and shames aredreadful at least she added catching herself up i supposethey are for what as i say do i know of them i don t want toknow she spoke quite with vehemence there are things thatare sacred whether they re joys or pains but one can always forsafety be kind she kept on one feels when that s right she had got up with these last words she stood there before himwith that particular suggestion in her aspect to which even thelong habit of their life together had not closed his sense keptsharp year after year by the collation of types and signs thecomparison of fine object with fine object of one degree offinish of one form of the exquisite with another the appearanceof some slight slim draped antique of vatican or capitolinehalls late and refined rare as a note and immortal as a link set in motion by the miraculous infusion of a modern impulse andyet for all the sudden freedom of folds and footsteps forsakenafter centuries by their pedestal keeping still the quality theperfect felicity of the statue the blurred absent eyes thesmoothed elegant nameless head the impersonal flit of acreature lost in an alien age and passing as an image in wornrelief round and round a precious vase she had always had oddmoments of striking him daughter of his very own though she was as a figure thus simplified generalised in its grace a figurewith which his human connection was fairly interrupted by somevague analogy of turn and attitude something shyly mythologicaland nymphlike the trick he was not uncomplacently aware wasmainly of his own mind it came from his caring for preciousvases only less than for precious daughters and what was more tothe point still it often operated while he was quite at the sametime conscious that maggie had been described even in herprettiness as prim mrs rance herself had enthusiasticallyused the word of her while he remembered that when once she hadbeen told before him familiarly that she resembled a nun shehad replied that she was delighted to hear it and would certainlytry to while also finally it was present to him that discreetly heedless thanks to her long association withnobleness in art to the leaps and bounds of fashion she broughther hair down very straight and flat over her temples in theconstant manner of her mother who had not been a bitmythological nymphs and nuns were certainly separate types butmr verver when he really amused himself let consistency go the play of vision was at all events so rooted in him that hecould receive impressions of sense even while positivelythinking he was positively thinking while maggie stood there and it led for him to yet another question which in its turn ledto others still do you regard the condition as hers then thatyou spoke of a minute ago the condition why that of having loved so intensely that she s as you say beyond everything maggie had scarcely to reflect her answer was so prompt oh no she s beyond nothing for she has had nothing i see you must have had things to be them it s a kind of lawof perspective maggie didn t know about the law but she continued definite she s not for example beyond help oh well then she shall have all we can give her i ll write toher he said with pleasure angel she answered as she gaily and tenderly looked at him true as this might be however there was one thing more he wasan angel with a human curiosity has she told you she likes memuch certainly she has told me but i won t pamper you let it beenough for you it has always been one of my reasons for likingher then she s indeed not beyond everything mr verver more orless humorously observed oh it isn t thank goodness that she s in love with you it snot as i told you at first the sort of thing for you to fear he had spoken with cheer but it appeared to drop before thisreassurance as if the latter overdid his alarm and that shouldbe corrected oh my dear i ve always thought of her as alittle girl ah she s not a little girl said the princess then i ll write to her as a brilliant woman it s exactly what she is mr verver had got up as he spoke and for a little beforeretracing their steps they stood looking at each other as ifthey had really arranged something they had come out togetherfor themselves but it had produced something more what it hadproduced was in fact expressed by the words with which he met hiscompanion s last emphasis well she has a famous friend in you princess maggie took this in it was too plain for a protest do you knowwhat i m really thinking of she asked he wondered with her eyes on him eyes of contentment at herfreedom now to talk and he wasn t such a fool he presentlyshowed as not suddenly to arrive at it why of your findingher at last yourself a husband good for you maggie smiled but it will take she added some looking then let me look right here with you her father said as theywalked on ximrs assingham and the colonel quitting fawns before the end ofseptember had come back later on and now a couple of weeksafter they were again interrupting their stay but this timewith the question of their return left to depend on matters thatwere rather hinted at than importunately named the lutches andmrs rance had also by the action of charlotte stant s arrival ceased to linger though with hopes and theories as to somepromptitude of renewal of which the lively expression awakeningthe echoes of the great stone paved oak panelled galleried hallthat was not the least interesting feature of the place seemedstill a property of the air it was on this admirable spot that before her october afternoon had waned fanny assingham spentwith her easy host a few moments which led to her announcing herown and her husband s final secession at the same time as theytempted her to point the moral of all vain reverberations thedouble door of the house stood open to an effect of hazy autumnsunshine a wonderful windless waiting golden hour under theinfluence of which adam verver met his genial friend as she cameto drop into the post box with her own hand a thick sheaf ofletters they presently thereafter left the house together anddrew out half an hour on the terrace in a manner they were torevert to in thought later on as that of persons who really hadbeen taking leave of each other at a parting of the ways hetraced his impression on coming to consider back to a merethree words she had begun by using about charlotte stant shesimply cleared them out those had been the three words thrownoff in reference to the general golden peace that the kentishoctober had gradually ushered in the halcyon days the fullbeauty of which had appeared to shine out for them aftercharlotte s arrival for it was during these days that mrs ranceand the miss lutches had been observed to be gathering themselvesfor departure and it was with that difference made that thesense of the whole situation showed most fair the sense of howright they had been to engage for so ample a residence and ofall the pleasure so fruity an autumn there could hold in its lap this was what had occurred that their lesson had been learned and what mrs assingham had dwelt upon was that without charlotteit would have been learned but half it would certainly not havebeen taught by mrs rance and the miss lutches if these ladieshad remained with them as long as at one time seemed probable charlotte s light intervention had thus become a cause operatingcovertly but none the less actively and fanny assingham sspeech which she had followed up a little echoed within him fairly to startle him as the indication of somethingirresistible he could see now how this superior force hadworked and he fairly liked to recover the sight little harm ashe dreamed of doing little ill as he dreamed of wishing thethree ladies whom he had after all entertained for a stiffishseries of days she had been so vague and quiet about it wonderful charlotte that he hadn t known what was happening happening that is as a result of her influence their fires as they felt her turned to smoke mrs assingham remarked which he was to reflect on indeed even while they strolled hehad retained since his long talk with maggie the talk that hadsettled the matter of his own direct invitation to her friend anodd little taste as he would have described it for hearingthings said about this young woman hearing so to speak whatcould be said about her almost as it her portrait by someeminent hand were going on so that he watched it grow under themultiplication of touches mrs assingham it struck him appliedtwo or three of the finest in their discussion of their youngfriend so different a figure now from that early playmate ofmaggie s as to whom he could almost recall from of old thedefinite occasions of his having paternally lumped the twochildren together in the recommendation that they shouldn t maketoo much noise nor eat too much jam his companion professed thatin the light of charlotte s prompt influence she had not been astranger to a pang of pity for their recent visitors i felt infact privately so sorry for them that i kept my impression tomyself while they were here wishing not to put the rest of youon the scent neither maggie nor the prince nor yourself noreven charlotte herself if you didn t happen to notice since youdidn t apparently i perhaps now strike you as extravagant buti m not i followed it all one saw the consciousness i speak ofcome over the poor things very much as i suppose people at thecourt of the borgias may have watched each other begin to lookqueer after having had the honour of taking wine with the headsof the family my comparison s only a little awkward for i don tin the least mean that charlotte was consciously dropping poisoninto their cup she was just herself their poison in the senseof mortally disagreeing with them but she didn t know it ah she didn t know it mr verver had asked with interest well i think she didn t mrs assingham had to admit that shehadn t pressingly sounded her i don t pretend to be sure inevery connection of what charlotte knows she doesn t certainly like to make people suffer not in general as is thecase with so many of us even other women she likes much ratherto put them at their ease with her she likes that is as allpleasant people do to be liked ah she likes to be liked her companion had gone on she did at the same time no doubt want to help us to put usat our ease that is she wanted to put you and to put maggieabout you so far as that went she had a plan but it was onlyafter it was not before i really believe that she saw howeffectively she could work again as mr verver felt he must have taken it up ah shewanted to help us wanted to help me why mrs assingham asked after an instant should it surpriseyou he just thought oh it doesn t she saw of course as soon as she came with her quickness where we all were she didn t need each of us to go byappointment to her room at night or take her out into thefields for our palpitating tale no doubt even she was ratherimpatient of the poor things mr verver had here inquired while hewaited well of your not yourselves being so and of your not inparticular i haven t the least doubt in the world par exemple that she thinks you too meek oh she thinks me too meek and she had been sent for on the very face of it to work rightin all she had to do after all was to be nice to you to a me said adam verver he could remember now that his friend had positively had a laughfor his tone to you and to every one she had only to be whatshe is and to be it all round if she s charming how can shehelp it so it was and so only that she acted as the borgiawine used to act one saw it come over them the extent to which in her particular way a woman a woman other and so other thanthemselves could be charming one saw them understand andexchange looks then one saw them lose heart and decide to move for what they had to take home was that it s she who s the realthing ah it s she who s the real thing as he had not hitherto takenit home as completely as the miss lutches and mrs rance so doubtless he had now a little appeared to offer submission inhis appeal i see i see he could at least simply take it homenow yet as not without wanting at the same time to be sure ofwhat the real thing was and what would it be a definitelythat you understand by that she had only for an instant not found it easy to say why exactly what those women themselves want to be and what hereffect on them is to make them recognise that they never will oh of course never it not only remained and abode with them it positively developedand deepened after this talk that the luxurious side of hispersonal existence was now again furnished socially speaking with the thing classed and stamped as real just as he had beenable to think of it as not otherwise enriched in consequence ofhis daughter s marriage the note of reality in so muchprojected light continued to have for him the charm and theimportance of which the maximum had occasionally been reached inhis great finds continued beyond any other to keep himattentive and gratified nothing perhaps might affect us asqueerer had we time to look into it than this application ofthe same measure of value to such different pieces of property asold persian carpets say and new human acquisitions all themore indeed that the amiable man was not without an inkling onhis own side that he was as a taster of life economicallyconstructed he put into his one little glass everything heraised to his lips and it was as if he had always carried in hispocket like a tool of his trade this receptacle a little glasscut with a fineness of which the art had long since been lost and kept in an old morocco case stamped in uneffaceable gilt withthe arms of a deposed dynasty as it had served him to satisfyhimself so to speak both about amerigo and about the bernadinoluini he had happened to come to knowledge of at the time he wasconsenting to the announcement of his daughter s betrothal so itserved him at present to satisfy himself about charlotte stantand an extraordinary set of oriental tiles of which he had latelygot wind to which a provoking legend was attached and as towhich he had made out contentedly that further news was to beobtained from a certain mr gutermann seuss of brighton it wasall at bottom in him the aesthetic principle planted where itcould burn with a cold still flame where it fed almost whollyon the material directly involved on the idea followed byappropriation of plastic beauty of the thing visibly perfect inits kind where in short in spite of the general tendency ofthe devouring element to spread the rest of his spiritualfurniture modest scattered and tended with unconscious care escaped the consumption that in so many cases proceeds from theundue keeping up of profane altar fires adam verver had in otherwords learnt the lesson of the senses to the end of his ownlittle book without having for a day raised the smallestscandal in his economy at large being in this particular notunlike those fortunate bachelors or other gentlemen of pleasure who so manage their entertainment of compromising company thateven the austerest housekeeper occupied and competent below stairs never feels obliged to give warning that figure has however a freedom that the occasion doubtlessscarce demands though we may retain it for its rough negativevalue it was to come to pass by a pressure applied to thesituation wholly from within that before the first ten days ofnovember had elapsed he found himself practically alone at fawnswith his young friend amerigo and maggie having with a certainabruptness invited his assent to their going abroad for a month since his amusement was now scarce less happily assured than hissecurity an impulse eminently natural had stirred within theprince his life as for some time established was deliciouslydull and thereby on the whole what he best liked but a smallgust of yearning had swept over him and maggie repeated to herfather with infinite admiration the pretty terms in which after it had lasted a little he had described to her thisexperience he called it a serenade a low music that outsideone of the windows of the sleeping house disturbed his rest atnight timid as it was and plaintive he yet couldn t close hiseyes for it and when finally rising on tiptoe he had lookedout he had recognised in the figure below with a mandolin allduskily draped in her grace the raised appealing eyes and theone irresistible voice of the ever to be loved italy sooner orlater that way one had to listen it was a hovering hauntingghost as of a creature to whom one had done a wrong a dim pathetic shade crying out to be comforted for this there wasobviously but one way as there were doubtless also many wordsfor the simple fact that so prime a roman had a fancy for againseeing rome they would accordingly hadn t they better go fora little maggie meanwhile making the too absurdly artful pointwith her father so that he repeated it in his amusement tocharlotte stant to whom he was by this time conscious ofaddressing many remarks that it was absolutely when she came tothink the first thing amerigo had ever asked of her shedoesn t count of course his having asked of her to marry him this was mr verver s indulgent criticism but he foundcharlotte equally touched by the ingenuous maggie in easyagreement with him over the question if the prince had askedsomething of his wife every day in the year this would be stillno reason why the poor dear man should not in a beautiful fit ofhomesickness revisit without reproach his native country what his father in law frankly counselled was that thereasonable the really too reasonable pair should while theywere about it take three or four weeks of paris as well parisbeing always for mr verver in any stress of sympathy asuggestion that rose of itself to the lips if they would only dothat on their way back or however they preferred it charlotteand he would go over to join them there for a small look thougheven then assuredly as he had it at heart to add not in theleast because they should have found themselves bored at beingleft together the fate of this last proposal indeed was that itreeled for the moment under an assault of destructive analysisfrom maggie who having as she granted to choose between beingan unnatural daughter or an unnatural mother and electing forthe former wanted to know what would become of the principino ifthe house were cleared of everyone but the servants her questionhad fairly resounded but it had afterwards like many of herquestions dropped still more effectively than it had risen thehighest moral of the matter being before the couple took theirdeparture that mrs noble and dr brady must mount unchallengedguard over the august little crib if she hadn t supremelybelieved in the majestic value of the nurse whose experience wasin itself the amplest of pillows just as her attention was aspreading canopy from which precedent and reminiscence dropped asthickly as parted curtains if she hadn t been able to rest inthis confidence she would fairly have sent her husband on hisjourney without her in the same manner if the sweetest for itwas so she qualified him of little country doctors hadn t provedto her his wisdom by rendering irresistible especially on rainydays and in direct proportion to the frequency of his calls adapted to all weathers that she should converse with him forhours over causes and consequences over what he had found toanswer with his little five at home she would have drawn scantsupport from the presence of a mere grandfather and a merebrilliant friend these persons accordingly her ownpredominance having thus for the time given way could carrywith a certain ease and above all with mutual aid theirconsciousness of a charge so far as their office weighed theycould help each other with it which was in fact to become asmrs noble herself loomed larger for them not a little of arelief and a diversion mr verver met his young friend at certain hours in theday nursery very much as he had regularly met the child s fondmother charlotte having as she clearly considered given maggieequal pledges and desiring never to fail of the last word for thedaily letter she had promised to write she wrote with highfidelity she let her companion know and the effect of it was remarkably enough that he himself didn t write the reason ofthis was partly that charlotte told all about him which shealso let him know she did and partly that he enjoyed feeling asa consequence that he was generally quite systematically easedand as they said done for committed as it were to thischarming and clever young woman who by becoming for him adomestic resource had become for him practically a new person and committed especially in his own house which somehow madehis sense of it a deeper thing he took an interest in seeing howfar the connection could carry him could perhaps even lead him and in thus putting to the test for pleasant verification whatfanny assingham had said at the last about the difference sucha girl could make she was really making one now in theirsimplified existence and a very considerable one though therewas no one to compare her with as there had been so usefully for fanny no mrs rance no kitty no dotty lutch to help herto be felt according to fanny s diagnosis as real she wasreal decidedly from other causes and mr verver grew in timeeven a little amused at the amount of machinery mrs assinghamhad seemed to see needed for pointing it she was directly andimmediately real real on a pleasantly reduced and intimatescale and at no moments more so than during those at which wehave just glanced when mrs noble made them both together feelthat she she alone in the absence of the queen mother wasregent of the realm and governess of the heir treated on suchoccasions as at best a pair of dangling and merely nominalcourt functionaries picturesque hereditary triflers entitled tothe petites entrees but quite external to the state which beganand ended with the nursery they could only retire in quickenedsociability to what was left them of the palace there to digesttheir gilded insignificance and cultivate in regard to the trueexecutive such snuff taking ironies as might belong to rococochamberlains moving among china lap dogs every evening after dinner charlotte stant played to him seated at the piano and requiring no music she went through his favourite things and he had many favourites with a facilitythat never failed or that failed but just enough to pick itselfup at a touch from his fitful voice she could play anything shecould play everything always shockingly she of course insisted but always by his own vague measure very much as if she might slim sinuous and strong and with practised passion have beenplaying lawn tennis or endlessly and rhythmically waltzing hislove of music unlike his other loves owned to vaguenesses butwhile on his comparatively shaded sofa and smoking smoking always smoking in the great fawns drawing room as everywhere the cigars of his youth rank with associations while i say heso listened to charlotte s piano where the score was ever absentbut between the lighted candles the picture distinct thevagueness spread itself about him like some boundless carpet asurface delightfully soft to the pressure of his interest it wasa manner of passing the time that rather replaced conversation but the air at the end none the less before they separated had a way of seeming full of the echoes of talk they separated in the hushed house not quite easily yet not quite awkwardlyeither with tapers that twinkled in the large dark spaces andfor the most part so late that the last solemn servant had beendismissed for the night late as it was on a particular evening toward the end of october there had been a full word or two dropped into the still stirringsea of other voices a word or two that affected our friend evenat the moment and rather oddly as louder and rounder than anyprevious sound and then he had lingered under pretext of anopened window to be made secure after taking leave of hiscompanion in the hall and watching her glimmer away up thestaircase he had for himself another impulse than to go to bed picking up a hat in the hall slipping his arms into a sleevelesscape and lighting still another cigar he turned out upon theterrace through one of the long drawing room windows and moved toand fro there for an hour beneath the sharp autumn stars it waswhere he had walked in the afternoon sun with fanny assingham and the sense of that other hour the sense of the suggestivewoman herself was before him again as in spite of all theprevious degustation we have hinted at it had not yet been hethought in a loose an almost agitated order of many things the power that was in them to agitate having been part of hisconviction that he should not soon sleep he truly felt for awhile that he should never sleep again till something had come tohim some light some idea some mere happy word perhaps that hehad begun to want but had been till now and especially the lastday or two vainly groping for can you really then come if westart early that was practically all he had said to the girlas she took up her bedroom light and why in the world not wheni ve nothing else to do and should besides so immensely likeit this had as definitely been on her side the limit of thelittle scene there had in fact been nothing to call a scene even of the littlest at all though he perhaps didn t quite knowwhy something like the menace of one hadn t proceeded from herstopping half way upstairs to turn and say as she looked down onhim that she promised to content herself for their journey with a toothbrush and a sponge there hovered about him at allevents while he walked appearances already familiar as well astwo or three that were new and not the least vivid of the formerconnected itself with that sense of being treated withconsideration which had become for him as we have noted one ofthe minor yet so far as there were any such quite one of thecompensatory incidents of being a father in law it had struckhim up to now that this particular balm was a mixture of whichamerigo as through some hereditary privilege alone possessedthe secret so that he found himself wondering if it had come to charlotte who had unmistakably acquired it through the youngman s having amiably passed it on she made use for her soquietly grateful host however this might be of quite the sameshades of attention and recognition was mistress in an equaldegree of the regulated the developed art of placing him high inthe scale of importance that was even for his own thought aclumsy way of expressing the element of similarity in theagreeable effect they each produced on him and it held him for alittle only because this coincidence in their felicity caused himvaguely to connect or associate them in the matter of tradition training tact or whatever else one might call it it mightalmost have been if such a link between them was to beimagined that amerigo had a little coached or incited theiryoung friend or perhaps rather that she had simply as one ofthe signs of the general perfection fanny assingham commended inher profited by observing during her short opportunity beforethe start of the travellers the pleasant application by theprince of his personal system he might wonder what exactly itwas that they so resembled each other in treating him like fromwhat noble and propagated convention in cases in which theexquisite importance was to be neither too grossly attributednor too grossly denied they had taken their specific lesson butthe difficulty was here of course that one could really neverknow couldn t know without having been one s self a personage whether a pope a king a president a peer a general or just abeautiful author before such a question as before several others when theyrecurred he would come to a pause leaning his arms on the oldparapet and losing himself in a far excursion he had as to somany of the matters in hand a divided view and this was exactlywhat made him reach out in his unrest for some idea lurking inthe vast freshness of the night at the breath of whichdisparities would submit to fusion and so spreading beneathhim make him feel that he floated what he kept finding himselfreturn to disturbingly enough was the reflection deeper thananything else that in forming a new and intimate tie he shouldin a manner abandon or at the best signally relegate hisdaughter he should reduce to definite form the idea that he hadlost her as was indeed inevitable by her own marriage heshould reduce to definite form the idea of his having incurred aninjury or at the best an inconvenience that required somemakeweight and deserved some amends and he should do this themore which was the great point that he should appear to adopt in doing it the sentiment in fact the very conviction entertained and quite sufficiently expressed by maggie herself in her beautiful generosity as to what he had suffered puttingit with extravagance at her hands if she put it withextravagance the extravagance was yet sincere for it came whichshe put with extravagance too from her persistence always inthinking feeling talking about him as young he had hadglimpses of moments when to hear her thus in her absolutelyunforced compunction one would have supposed the special edge ofthe wrong she had done him to consist in his having still beforehim years and years to groan under it she had sacrificed aparent the pearl of parents no older than herself it wouldn tso much have mattered if he had been of common parental age thathe wasn t that he was just her extraordinary equal andcontemporary this was what added to her act the long train ofits effect light broke for him at last indeed quite as aconsequence of the fear of breathing a chill upon this luxurianceof her spiritual garden as at a turn of his labyrinth he saw hisissue which opened out so wide for the minute that he held hisbreath with wonder he was afterwards to recall how just then the autumn night seemed to clear to a view in which the wholeplace everything round him the wide terrace where he stood theothers with their steps below the gardens the park the lake the circling woods lay there as under some strange midnight sun it all met him during these instants as a vast expanse ofdiscovery a world that looked so lighted extraordinarily new and in which familiar objects had taken on a distinctness that as if it had been a loud a spoken pretension to beauty interest importance to he scarce knew what gave them aninordinate quantity of character and verily an inordinate size this hallucination or whatever he might have called it wasbrief but it lasted long enough to leave him gasping the gaspof admiration had by this time however lost itself in anintensity that quickly followed the way the wonder of it sincewonder was in question truly had been the strange delay of hisvision he had these several days groped and groped for an objectthat lay at his feet and as to which his blindness came from hisstupidly looking beyond it had sat all the while at his hearth stone whence it now gazed up in his face once he had recognised it there everything became coherent thesharp point to which all his light converged was that the wholecall of his future to him as a father would be in his somanaging that maggie would less and less appear to herself tohave forsaken him and it not only wouldn t be decently humane decently possible not to make this relief easy to her the ideashone upon him more than that as exciting inspiring uplifting it fell in so beautifully with what might be otherwisepossible it stood there absolutely confronted with the materialway in which it might be met the way in which it might be metwas by his putting his child at peace and the way to put her atpeace was to provide for his future that is for hers bymarriage by a marriage as good speaking proportionately ashers had been as he fairly inhaled this measure of refreshmenthe tasted the meaning of recent agitations he had seen thatcharlotte could contribute what he hadn t seen was what shecould contribute to when it had all supremely cleared up and hehad simply settled this service to his daughter well before himas the proper direction of his young friend s leisure the cooldarkness had again closed round him but his moral lucidity wasconstituted it wasn t only moreover that the word with a click so fitted the riddle but that the riddle in such perfection fitted the word he might have been equally in want and yet nothave had his remedy oh if charlotte didn t accept him ofcourse the remedy would fail but as everything had fallentogether it was at least there to be tried and success would begreat that was his last throb if the measure of relief effectedfor maggie should at all prove to have been given by his ownactual sense of felicity he really didn t know when in his lifehe had thought of anything happier to think of it merely forhimself would have been even as he had just lately felt evendoing all justice to that condition yes impossible but therewas a grand difference in thinking of it for his child xiiit was at brighton above all that this difference came out itwas during the three wonderful days he spent there with charlottethat he had acquainted himself further though doubtless not evennow quite completely with the merits of his majestic scheme andwhile moreover to begin with he still but held his vision inplace steadying it fairly with his hands as he had oftensteadied for inspection a precarious old pot or kept a glazedpicture in its right relation to the light the other the outerpresumptions in his favour those independent of what he mighthimself contribute and that therefore till he should speak remained necessarily vague that quantity i say struck him aspositively multiplying as putting on in the fresh brighton airand on the sunny brighton front a kind of tempting palpability he liked in this preliminary stage to feel that he should beable to speak and that he would the word itself beingromantic pressing for him the spring of association with storiesand plays where handsome and ardent young men in uniforms tights cloaks high boots had it in soliloquies ever on theirlips and the sense on the first day that he should probably havetaken the great step before the second was over conduced alreadyto make him say to his companion that they must spend more thantheir mere night or two at his ease on the ground of what wasbefore him he at all events definitely desired to be and it wasstrongly his impression that he was proceeding step by step hewas acting it kept coming back to that not in the dark but inthe high golden morning not in precipitation flurry fever dangers these of the path of passion properly so called but withthe deliberation of a plan a plan that might be a thing of lessjoy than a passion but that probably would in compensation forthat loss be found to have the essential property to wear eventhe decent dignity of reaching further and of providing for morecontingencies the season was in local parlance on theelements were assembled the big windy hotel the draughty socialhall swarmed with types in charlotte s constant phrase andresounded with a din in which the wild music of gilded andbefrogged bands croatian dalmatian carpathian violentlyexotic and nostalgic was distinguished as struggling against theperpetual popping of corks much of this would decidedly havedisconcerted our friends if it hadn t all happened morepreponderantly to give them the brighter surprise the nobleprivacy of fawns had left them had left mr verver at least with a little accumulated sum of tolerance to spend on the highpitch and high colour of the public sphere fawns as it had beenfor him and as maggie and fanny assingham had both attested wasout of the world whereas the scene actually about him with thevery sea a mere big booming medium for excursions and aquariums affected him as so plump in the conscious centre that nothingcould have been more complete for representing that pulse of lifewhich they had come to unanimity at home on the subject of theiradvisedly not hereafter forgetting the pulse of life was whatcharlotte in her way at home had lately reproduced and therewere positively current hours when it might have been open to hercompanion to feel himself again indebted to her forintroductions he had brought her to put it crudely but itwas almost as if she were herself in her greater gaiety herlivelier curiosity and intensity her readier happier irony taking him about and showing him the place no one really whenhe came to think had ever taken him about before it had alwaysbeen he of old who took others and who in particular tookmaggie this quickly fell into its relation with him as part ofan experience marking for him no doubt what people call considerately a time of life a new and pleasant order aflattered passive state that might become why shouldn t it one of the comforts of the future mr gutermann seuss proved on the second day our friend hadwaited till then a remarkably genial a positively lustrousyoung man occupying a small neat house in a quarter of the placeremote from the front and living as immediate and striking signstestified in the bosom of his family our visitors foundthemselves introduced by the operation of close contiguity to anumerous group of ladies and gentlemen older and younger and ofchildren larger and smaller who mostly affected them as scarceless anointed for hospitality and who produced at first theimpression of a birthday party of some anniversary gregariouslyand religiously kept though they subsequently fell into theirplaces as members of one quiet domestic circle preponderantlyand directly indebted for their being in fact to mr gutermann seuss to the casual eye a mere smart and shining youthof less than thirty summers faultlessly appointed in everyparticular he yet stood among his progeny eleven in all as heconfessed without a sigh eleven little brown clear faces yetwith such impersonal old eyes astride of such impersonal oldnoses while he entertained the great american collector whom hehad so long hoped he might meet and whose charming companion the handsome frank familiar young lady presumably mrs verver noticed the graduated offspring noticed the fat ear ringedaunts and the glossy cockneyfied familiar uncles inimitable ofaccent and assumption and of an attitude of cruder intentionthan that of the head of the firm noticed the place in short noticed the treasure produced noticed everything as from thehabit of a person finding her account at any time according to awisdom well learned of life in almost any funny impression itreally came home to her friend on the spot that this free rangeof observation in her picking out the frequent funny withextraordinary promptness would verily henceforth make adifferent thing for him of such experiences of the customaryhunt for the possible prize the inquisitive play of his acceptedmonomania which different thing could probably be a lighter andperhaps thereby a somewhat more boisterously refreshing form ofsport such omens struck him as vivid in any case when mr gutermann seuss with a sharpness of discrimination he had atfirst scarce seemed to promise invited his eminent couple intoanother room before the threshold of which the rest of thetribe unanimously faltering dropped out of the scene thetreasure itself here the objects on behalf of which mr verver sinterest had been booked established quickly enough their claimto engage the latter s attention yet at what point of his pastdid our friend s memory looking back and back catch him in anysuch place thinking so much less of wares artfully paraded thanof some other and quite irrelevant presence such places were notstrange to him when they took the form of bourgeois back parlours a trifle ominously grey and grim from their northlight at watering places prevailingly homes of humbug or evenwhen they wore some aspect still less if not perhaps still more insidious he had been everywhere pried and prowled everywhere going on occasion so far as to risk he believed life healthand the very bloom of honour but where while precious things extracted one by one from thrice locked yet often vulgar drawersand soft satchels of old oriental ilk were impressively rangedbefore him had he till now let himself in consciousness wander like one of the vague he didn t betray it ah that he knew but two recognitions tookplace for him at once and one of them suffered a little insweetness by the confusion mr gutermann seuss had truly forthe crisis the putting down of his cards a rare manner he wasperfect master of what not to say to such a personage as mr verver while the particular importance that dispenses withchatter was diffused by his movements themselves his repeatedact of passage between a featureless mahogany meuble and a tableso virtuously disinterested as to look fairly smug under a cottoncloth of faded maroon and indigo all redolent of patriarchalteas the damascene tiles successively and oh so tenderly unmuffled and revealed lay there at last in their full harmonyand their venerable splendour but the tribute of appreciationand decision was while the spectator considered simplified to apoint that but just failed of representing levity on the part ofa man who had always acknowledged without shame in such affairs the intrinsic charm of what was called discussion the infinitelyancient the immemorial amethystine blue of the glaze scarcelymore meant to be breathed upon it would seem than the cheek ofroyalty this property of the ordered and matched array hadinevitably all its determination for him but his submission was perhaps for the first time in his life of the quick mind alone the process really itself in its way as fine as the perfectionperceived and admired every inch of the rest of him being givento the foreknowledge that an hour or two later he should have spoken the burning of his ships therefore waited too near tolet him handle his opportunity with his usual firm and sentientfingers waited somehow in the predominance of charlotte s veryperson in her being there exactly as she was capable as mr gutermann seuss himself was capable of the right felicity ofsilence but with an embracing ease through it all that madedeferred criticism as fragrant as some joy promised a lover byhis mistress or as a big bridal bouquet held patiently behindher he couldn t otherwise have explained surely why he foundhimself thinking to his enjoyment of so many other matters thanthe felicity of his acquisition and the figure of his cheque quite equally high any more than why later on with theirreturn to the room in which they had been received and therenewed encompassment of the tribe he felt quite merged in theelated circle formed by the girl s free response to thecollective caress of all the shining eyes and by her genialacceptance of the heavy cake and port wine that as she wasafterwards to note added to their transaction for a finish thetouch of some mystic rite of old jewry this characterisation came from her as they walked away walkedtogether in the waning afternoon back to the breezy sea and thebustling front back to the nimble and the flutter and theshining shops that sharpened the grin of solicitation on the maskof night they were walking thus as he felt nearer and nearerto where he should see his ships burn and it was meanwhile forhim quite as if this red glow would impart at the harmonioushour a lurid grandeur to his good faith it was meanwhile too asign of the kind of sensibility often playing up in him that fabulous as this truth may sound he found a sentimental link anobligation of delicacy or perhaps even one of the penalties ofits opposite in his having exposed her to the north light thequite properly hard business light of the room in which they hadbeen alone with the treasure and its master she had listened tothe name of the sum he was capable of looking in the face giventhe relation of intimacy with him she had already beyond allretractation accepted the stir of the air produced at the otherplace by that high figure struck him as a thing that from themoment she had exclaimed or protested as little as he himself hadapologised left him but one thing more to do a man of decentfeeling didn t thrust his money a huge lump of it in such away under a poor girl s nose a girl whose poverty was after afashion the very basis of her enjoyment of his hospitality without seeing logically a responsibility attached and thiswas to remain none the less true for the fact that twenty minuteslater after he had applied his torch applied it with a sign ortwo of insistence what might definitely result failed to beimmediately clear he had spoken spoken as they sat together onthe out of the way bench observed during one of their walks andkept for the previous quarter of the present hour well in hismemory s eye the particular spot to which between intensepauses and intenser advances he had all the while consistentlyled her below the great consolidated cliff well on to where thecity of stucco sat most architecturally perched with therumbling beach and the rising tide and the freshening stars infront and above the safe sense of the whole place yet prevailedin lamps and seats and flagged walks hovering also overhead inthe close neighbourhood of a great replete community about toassist anew at the removal of dish covers we ve had as it seems to me such quite beautiful daystogether that i hope it won t come to you too much as a shockwhen i ask if you think you could regard me with any satisfactionas a husband as if he had known she wouldn t she of coursecouldn t at all gracefully and whether or no reply with arush he had said a little more quite as he had felt he must inthinking it out in advance he had put the question on whichthere was no going back and which represented thereby thesacrifice of his vessels and what he further said was to standfor the redoubled thrust of flame that would make combustionsure this isn t sudden to me and i ve wondered at moments ifyou haven t felt me coming to it i ve been coming ever since weleft fawns i really started while we were there he spokeslowly giving her as he desired time to think all the morethat it was making her look at him steadily and making her also in a remarkable degree look well while she did so a largeand so far a happy consequence she wasn t at all eventsshocked which he had glanced at but for a handsome humility andhe would give her as many minutes as she liked you mustn tthink i m forgetting that i m not young oh that isn t so it s i that am old you are young this waswhat she had at first answered and quite in the tone too ofhaving taken her minutes it had not been wholly to the point but it had been kind which was what he most wanted and shekept for her next words to kindness kept to her clear loweredvoice and unshrinking face to me too it thoroughly seems thatthese days have been beautiful i shouldn t be grateful to themif i couldn t more or less have imagined their bringing us tothis she affected him somehow as if she had advanced a step tomeet him and yet were at the same time standing still it onlymeant however doubtless that she was gravely and reasonably thinking as he exactly desired to make her if she would butthink enough she would probably think to suit him it seems tome she went on that it s for you to be sure ah but i am sure said adam verver on matters of importancei never speak when i m not so if you can yourself face such aunion you needn t in the least trouble she had another pause and she might have been felt as facing itwhile through lamplight and dusk through the breath of themild slightly damp southwest she met his eyes without evasion yet she had at the end of another minute debated only to theextent of saying i won t pretend i don t think it would be goodfor me to marry good for me i mean she pursued because i mso awfully unattached i should like to be a little less adrift i should like to have a home i should like to have an existence i should like to have a motive for one thing more than another amotive outside of myself in fact she said so sincerely thatit almost showed pain yet so lucidly that it almost showedhumour in fact you know i want to be married it s well it s the condition the condition he was just vague it s the state i mean i don t like my own miss among usall is too dreadful except for a shopgirl i don t want to be ahorrible english old maid oh you want to be taken care of very well then i ll do it i dare say it s very much that only i don t see why for what ispeak of she smiled for a mere escape from my state i needdo quite so much so much as marry me in particular her smile was as for true directness i might get what i wantfor less you think it so much for you to do yes she presently said i think it s a great deal then it was that though she was so gentle so quite perfect withhim and he felt he had come on far then it was that of a suddensomething seemed to fail and he didn t quite know where theywere there rose for him with this the fact to be sure oftheir disparity deny it as mercifully and perversely as shewould he might have been her father of course yes that s mydisadvantage i m not the natural i m so far from being theideal match to your youth and your beauty i ve the drawback thatyou ve seen me always so inevitably in such another light but she gave a slow headshake that made contradiction soft madeit almost sad in fact as from having to be so complete and hehad already before she spoke the dim vision of some objectionin her mind beside which the one he had named was light andwhich therefore must be strangely deep you don t understand me it s of all that it is for you to do it s of that i m thinking oh with this for him the thing was clearer then you needn tthink i know enough what it is for me to do but she shook her head again i doubt if you know i doubt ifyou can and why not please when i ve had you so before me that i mold has at least that fact about it to the good that i ve knownyou long and from far back do you think you ve known me asked charlotte stant hehesitated for the tone of it and her look with it might havemade him doubt just these things in themselves however withall the rest with his fixed purpose now his committed deed thefine pink glow projected forward of his ships behind him definitely blazing and crackling this quantity was to push himharder than any word of her own could warn him all that she washerself moreover was so lighted to its advantage by the pinkglow he wasn t rabid but he wasn t either as a man of a properspirit to be frightened what is that then if i accept it butas strong a reason as i can want for just learning to know you she faced him always kept it up as for honesty and yet at thesame time in her odd way as for mercy how can you tellwhether if you did you would it was ambiguous for an instant as she showed she felt i meanwhen it s a question of learning one learns sometimes too late i think it s a question he promptly enough made answer ofliking you the more just for your saying these things you shouldmake something he added of my liking you i make everything but are you sure of having exhausted allother ways this of a truth enlarged his gaze but what other ways why you ve more ways of being kind than anyone i ever knew take it then he answered that i m simply putting them alltogether for you she looked at him on this long again stillas if it shouldn t be said she hadn t given him time or hadwithdrawn from his view so to speak a single inch of hersurface this at least she was fully to have exposed itrepresented her as oddly conscientious and he scarce knew inwhat sense it affected him on the whole however withadmiration you re very very honourable it s just what i want to be i don t see she added whyyou re not right i don t see why you re not happy as you are ican not ask myself i can not ask you she went on if you rereally as much at liberty as your universal generosity leads youto assume oughtn t we she asked to think a little of others oughtn t i at least in loyalty at any rate in delicacy tothink of maggie with which intensely gentle so as not toappear too much to teach him his duty she explained she severything to you she has always been are you so certain thatthere s room in your life for another daughter is that what you mean she had not hungupon it long but he had quickly taken her up he had not however disconcerted her for another young woman very much of her age and whose relation to her has always beenso different from what our marrying would make it for anothercompanion said charlotte stant can t a man be all his life then he almost fiercely asked anything but a father but he went on before she could answer you talk about differences but they ve been already made as noone knows better than maggie she feels the one she made herselfby her own marriage made i mean for me she constantly thinksof it it allows her no rest to put her at peace is therefore he explained what i m trying with you to do i can t do italone but i can do it with your help you can make her hesaid positively happy about me about you she thoughtfully echoed but what can i make herabout herself oh if she s at ease about me the rest will take care of itself the case he declared is in your hands you ll effectually putout of her mind that i feel she has abandoned me interest certainly now was what he had kindled in her face butit was all the more honourable to her as he had just called itthat she should want to see each of the steps of his conviction if you ve been driven to the likes of me mayn t it show thatyou ve felt truly forsaken well i m willing to suggest that if i can show at the sametime that i feel consoled but have you she demanded really felt so he hesitated consoled forsaken no i haven t but if it s her idea if it was her idea inshort that was enough this enunciation of motive the nextmoment however sounded to him perhaps slightly thin so that hegave it another touch that is if it s my idea i happen yousee to like my idea well it s beautiful and wonderful but isn t it possibly charlotte asked not quite enough to marry me for why so my dear child isn t a man s idea usually what he doesmarry for charlotte considering looked as if this might perhaps be alarge question or at all events something of an extension of onethey were immediately concerned with doesn t that a good dealdepend on the sort of thing it may be she suggested that aboutmarriage ideas as he called them might differ with which however giving no more time to it she sounded another question don t you appear rather to put it to me that i may accept youroffer for maggie s sake somehow she turned it over i don tso clearly see her quite so much finding reassurance or evenquite so much needing it do you then make nothing at all of her having been so ready toleave us ah charlotte on the contrary made much she was ready to leaveus because she had to be from the moment the prince wanted itshe could only go with him perfectly so that if you see your way she will be able to gowith him in future as much as she likes charlotte appeared to examine for a minute in maggie s interest this privilege the result of which was a limited concession you ve certainly worked it out of course i ve worked it out that s exactly what i have done she hadn t for a long time been so happy about anything as atyour being there with me i was to be with you said charlotte for her security well adam verver rang out this is her security you veonly if you can t see it to ask her ask her the girl echoed it in wonder certainly in somany words telling her you don t believe me still she debated do you mean write it to her quite so immediately to morrow oh i don t think i can write it said charlotte stant when iwrite to her and she looked amused for so different a shade it s about the principino s appetite and dr brady s visits very good then put it to her face to face we ll go straight toparis to meet them charlotte at this rose with a movement that was like a smallcry but her unspoken sense lost itself while she stood with hereyes on him he keeping his seat as for the help it gave him alittle to make his appeal go up presently however a new sensehad come to her and she covered him kindly with the expressionof it i do think you know you must rather like me thank you said adam verver you will put it to her yourselfthen she had another hesitation we go over you say to meet them as soon as we can get back to fawns and wait there for them ifnecessary till they come wait a at fawns wait in paris that will be charming in itself you take me to pleasant places she turned it over youpropose to me beautiful things it rests but with you to make them beautiful and pleasant you ve made brighton ah she almost tenderly protested with what i m doing now you re promising me now what i want aren t you promising me he pressed getting up aren t you promising me to abide by whatmaggie says oh she wanted to be sure she was do you mean she ll ask it ofme it gave him indeed as by communication a sense of the proprietyof being himself certain yet what was he but certain she llspeak to you she ll speak to you for me this at last then seemed to satisfy her very good may we waitagain to talk of it till she has done so he showed with hishands down in his pockets and his shoulders expressively up acertain disappointment soon enough none the less hisgentleness was all back and his patience once more exemplary ofcourse i give you time especially he smiled as it s timethat i shall be spending with you our keeping on together willhelp you perhaps to see to see i mean how i need you i already see said charlotte how you ve persuaded yourselfyou do but she had to repeat it that isn t unfortunately all well then how you ll make maggie right right she echoed it as if the word went far and o oh she still critically murmured as they moved together away xiiihe had talked to her of their waiting in paris a week later buton the spot there this period of patience suffered no greatstrain he had written to his daughter not indeed from brighton but directly after their return to fawns where they spent onlyforty eight hours before resuming their journey and maggie sreply to his news was a telegram from rome delivered to him atnoon of their fourth day and which he brought out to charlotte who was seated at that moment in the court of the hotel wherethey had agreed that he should join her for their proceedingtogether to the noontide meal his letter at fawns a letter ofseveral pages and intended lucidly unreservedly in fact all buttriumphantly to inform had proved on his sitting down to it and a little to his surprise not quite so simple a document toframe as even his due consciousness of its weight of meaning hadallowed him to assume this doubtless however only for reasonsnaturally latent in the very wealth of that consciousness whichcontributed to his message something of their own quality ofimpatience the main result of their talk for the time had beena difference in his relation to his young friend as well as adifference equally sensible in her relation to himself andthis in spite of his not having again renewed his undertaking to speak to her so far even as to tell her of the communicationdespatched to rome delicacy a delicacy more beautiful still all the delicacy she should want reigned between them it beingrudimentary in their actual order that she mustn t be furtherworried until maggie should have put her at her ease it was just the delicacy however that in paris which suggestively was brighton at a hundredfold higher pitch made between him and his companion the tension made the suspense made what he would have consented perhaps to call the provisionalpeculiarity of present conditions these elements acted in amanner of their own imposing and involving under one head manyabstentions and precautions twenty anxieties and reminders things verily he would scarce have known how to express andyet creating for them at every step an acceptance of theirreality he was hanging back with charlotte till another personshould intervene for their assistance and yet they had by whathad already occurred been carried on to something it was out ofthe power of other persons to make either less or greater commonconventions that was what was odd had to be on this basis morethought of those common conventions that previous to thepassage by the brighton strand he had so enjoyed the sense oftheir overlooking the explanation would have been he supposed or would have figured it with less of unrest that paris had inits way deeper voices and warnings so that if you went at all far there it laid bristling traps as they might have beenviewed all smothered in flowers for your going further still there were strange appearances in the air and before you knew ityou might be unmistakably matching them since he wishedtherefore to match no appearance but that of a gentleman playingwith perfect fairness any game in life he might be called to hefound himself on the receipt of maggie s missive rejoicing witha certain inconsistency the announcement made her from home had in the act cost some biting of his pen to sundry parts of him his personal modesty his imagination of her prepared state forso quick a jump it didn t much matter which and yet he was moreeager than not for the drop of delay and for the quickertransitions promised by the arrival of the imminent pair therewas after all a hint of offence to a man of his age in beingtaken as they said at the shops on approval maggie certainly would have been as far as charlotte herself from positivelydesiring this and charlotte on her side as far as maggie fromholding him light as a real value she made him fidget thus poorgirl but from generous rigour of conscience these allowances of his spirit were all the same consistentwith a great gladness at the sight of the term of his ordeal forit was the end of his seeming to agree that questions and doubtshad a place the more he had inwardly turned the matter over themore it had struck him that they had in truth only an ugliness what he could have best borne as he now believed would havebeen charlotte s simply saying to him that she didn t like himenough this he wouldn t have enjoyed but he would quite haveunderstood it and been able ruefully to submit she did like himenough nothing to contradict that had come out for him so thathe was restless for her as well as for himself she looked at himhard a moment when he handed her his telegram and the look forwhat he fancied a dim shy fear in it gave him perhaps his bestmoment of conviction that as a man so to speak he properlypleased her he said nothing the words sufficiently did it forhim doing it again better still as charlotte who had left herchair at his approach murmured them out we start to night tobring you all our love and joy and sympathy there they were the words and what did she want more she didn t however asshe gave him back the little unfolded leaf say they were enough though he saw the next moment that her silence was probablynot disconnected from her having just visibly turned pale herextraordinarily fine eyes as it was his present theory that hehad always thought them shone at him the more darkly out of thischange of colour and she had again with it her apparent way ofsubjecting herself for explicit honesty and through herwillingness to face him to any view he might take all at hisease and even to wantonness of the condition he produced inher as soon as he perceived that emotion kept her soundless heknew himself deeply touched since it proved that little as sheprofessed she had been beautifully hoping they stood there aminute while he took in from this sign that yes then certainlyshe liked him enough liked him enough to make him old as he wasready to brand himself flush for the pleasure of it thepleasure of it accordingly made him speak first do you begin alittle to be satisfied still however she had to think we ve hurried them you see why so breathless a start because they want to congratulate us they want said adamverver to see our happiness she wondered again and this time also for him as publicly aspossible so much as that do you think it s too much she continued to think plainly they weren t to have started foranother week well what then isn t our situation worth the little sacrifice we ll go back to rome as soon as you like with them this seemed to hold her as he had previously seen her held justa trifle inscrutably by his allusions to what they would dotogether on a certain contingency worth it the littlesacrifice for whom for us naturally yes she said we wantto see them for our reasons that is she rather dimly smiled you do and you do my dear too he bravely declared yes then i dotoo she after an instant ungrudging enough acknowledged forus however something depends on it rather but does nothing depend on it for them what can from the moment that as appears they don t want tonip us in the bud i can imagine their rushing up to prevent us but an enthusiasm for us that can wait so very little suchintense eagerness i confess she went on more than a littlepuzzles me you may think me she also added ungracious andsuspicious but the prince can t at all want to come back sosoon he wanted quite too intensely to get away mr verver considered well hasn t he been away yes just long enough to see how he likes it besides saidcharlotte he may not be able to join in the rosy view of ourcase that you impute to her it can t in the least have appearedto him hitherto a matter of course that you should give his wifea bouncing stepmother adam verver at this looked grave i m afraid then he ll justhave to accept from us whatever his wife accepts and accept it if he can imagine no better reason just because she does that he declared will have to do for him his tone made her for a moment meet his face after which letme she abruptly said see it again taking from him thefolded leaf that she had given back and he had kept in his hand isn t the whole thing she asked when she had read it over perhaps but a way like another for their gaining time he again stood staring but the next minute with that upwardspring of his shoulders and that downward pressure of his pocketswhich she had already more than once at disconcerted moments determined in him he turned sharply away and wandered from herin silence he looked about in his small despair he crossed thehotel court which overarched and glazed muffled against loudsounds and guarded against crude sights heated gilded draped almost carpeted with exotic trees in tubs exotic ladies inchairs the general exotic accent and presence suspended as withwings folded or feebly fluttering in the superior the supreme the inexorably enveloping parisian medium resembled somecritical apartment of large capacity some dental medical surgical waiting room a scene of mixed anxiety and desire preparatory for gathered barbarians to the due amputation orextraction of excrescences and redundancies of barbarism he wentas far as the porte cochere took counsel afresh of his usualoptimism sharpened even somehow just here by the very air hetasted and then came back smiling to charlotte it isincredible to you that when a man is still as much in love asamerigo his most natural impulse should be to feel what his wifefeels to believe what she believes to want what she wants inthe absence that is of special impediments to his so doing the manner of it operated she acknowledged with no great delaythis natural possibility no nothing is incredible to me ofpeople immensely in love well isn t amerigo immensely in love she hesitated but as for the right expression of her sense of thedegree but she after all adopted mr verver s immensely then there you are she had another smile however she wasn t there quite yet thatisn t all that s wanted but what more why that his wife shall have made him really believe that shereally believes with which charlotte became still more lucidlylogical the reality of his belief will depend in such a case onthe reality of hers the prince may for instance now she wenton have made out to his satisfaction that maggie may mainlydesire to abound in your sense whatever it is you do he mayremember that he has never seen her do anything else well said adam verver what kind of a warning will he havefound in that to what catastrophe will he have observed such adisposition in her to lead just to this one with which she struck him as risingstraighter and clearer before him than she had done even yet our little question itself her appearance had in fact at themoment such an effect on him that he could answer but inmarvelling mildness hadn t we better wait a while till we callit a catastrophe her rejoinder to this was to wait though by no means as long ashe meant when at the end of her minute she spoke however itwas mildly too what would you like dear friend to wait for it lingered between them in the air this demand and theyexchanged for the time a look which might have made each of themseem to have been watching in the other the signs of its overtirony these were indeed immediately so visible in mr verver sface that as if a little ashamed of having so markedly producedthem and as if also to bring out at last under pressure something she had all the while been keeping back she took ajump to pure plain reason you haven t noticed for yourself buti can t quite help noticing that in spite of what you assume weassume if you like maggie wires her joy only to you she makesno sign of its overflow to me it was a point and staring a moment he took account of it buthe had as before his presence of mind to say nothing of hiskindly humour why you complain of the very thing that s mostcharmingly conclusive she treats us already as one clearly now for the girl in spite of lucidity and logic therewas something in the way he said things she faced him in allher desire to please him and then her word quite simply anddefinitely showed it i do like you you know well what could this do but stimulate his humour i see what sthe matter with you you won t be quiet till you ve heard fromthe prince himself i think the happy man added that i ll goand secretly wire to him that you d like reply paid a few wordsfor yourself it could apparently but encourage her further to smile replypaid for him you mean or for me oh i ll pay with pleasure anything back for you as manywords as you like and he went on to keep it up not requiringeither to see your message she could take it visibly as he meant it should you requireto see the prince s not a bit you can keep that also to yourself on his speaking however as if his transmitting the hint were areal question she appeared to consider and almost as if forgood taste that the joke had gone far enough it doesn tmatter unless he speaks of his own movement and why should itbe she asked a thing that would occur to him i really think mr verver concurred that it naturallywouldn t he doesn t know you re morbid she just wondered but she agreed no he hasn t yet found itout perhaps he will but he hasn t yet and i m willing to givehim meanwhile the benefit of the doubt so with this thesituation to her view would appear to have cleared had she nottoo quickly had one of her restless relapses maggie however does know i m morbid she hasn t the benefit well said adam verver a little wearily at last i think ifeel that you ll hear from her yet it had even fairly come overhim under recurrent suggestion that his daughter s omission wassurprising and maggie had never in her life been wrong for morethan three minutes oh it isn t that i hold that i ve a right to it charlotte thenext instant rather oddly qualified and the observation itselfgave him a further push very well i shall like it myself at this then as if moved by his way of constantly and more orless against his own contention coming round to her she showedhow she could also always and not less gently come half way ispeak of it only as the missing grace the grace that s ineverything that maggie does it isn t my due she kept it up but taking from you that we may still expect it it will havethe touch it will be beautiful then come out to breakfast mr verver had looked at hiswatch it will be here when we get back if it isn t and charlotte smiled as she looked about for afeather boa that she had laid down on descending from her room if it isn t it will have had but that slight fault he saw her boa on the arm of the chair from which she had movedto meet him and after he had fetched it raising it to make itscharming softness brush his face for it was a wondrous productof paris purchased under his direct auspices the day before heheld it there a minute before giving it up will you promise methen to be at peace she looked while she debated at his admirable present ipromise you quite for ever quite for ever remember he went on to justify his demand remember that inwiring you she ll naturally speak even more for her husband thanshe has done in wiring me it was only at a word that charlotte had a demur naturally why our marriage puts him for you you see or puts you forhim into a new relation whereas it leaves his relation to meunchanged it therefore gives him more to say to you about it about its making me his stepmother in law or whatever i shouldbecome over which for a little she not undivertedly mused yes there may easily be enough for a gentleman to say to ayoung woman about that well amerigo can always be according to the case either asfunny or as serious as you like and whichever he may be for you in sending you a message he ll be it all and then as the girl with one of her so deeply and oddly yet so tenderly criticallooks at him failed to take up the remark he found himselfmoved as by a vague anxiety to add a question don t you thinkhe s charming oh charming said charlotte stant if he weren t i shouldn tmind no more should i her friend harmoniously returned ah but you don t mind you don t have to you don t have to imean as i have it s the last folly ever to care in an anxiousway the least particle more than one is absolutely forced if iwere you she went on if i had in my life for happiness andpower and peace even a small fraction of what you have it wouldtake a great deal to make me waste my worry i don t know shesaid what in the world that didn t touch my luck i shouldtrouble my head about i quite understand you yet doesn t it just depend mr ververasked on what you call one s luck it s exactly my luck thati m talking about i shall be as sublime as you like when you vemade me all right it s only when one is right that one reallyhas the things you speak of it isn t they he explained thatmake one so it s the something else i want that makes themright if you ll give me what i ask you ll see she had taken her boa and thrown it over her shoulders and hereyes while she still delayed had turned from him engaged byanother interest though the court was by this time the hour ofdispersal for luncheon so forsaken that they would have had it for free talk should they have been moved to loudness quite tothemselves she was ready for their adjournment but she was alsoaware of a pedestrian youth in uniform a visible emissary ofthe postes et telegraphes who had approached from the street the small stronghold of the concierge and who presented there amissive taken from the little cartridge box slung over hisshoulder the portress meeting him on the threshold metequally across the court charlotte s marked attention to hisvisit so that within the minute she had advanced to ourfriends with her cap streamers flying and her smile ofannouncement as ample as her broad white apron she raised alofta telegraphic message and as she delivered it sociablydiscriminated cette fois ci pour madame with which she asgenially retreated leaving charlotte in possession charlotte taking it held it at first unopened her eyes had come back toher companion who had immediately and triumphantly greeted it ah there you are she broke the envelope then in silence and for a minute as withthe message he himself had put before her studied its contentswithout a sign he watched her without a question and at lastshe looked up i ll give you she simply said what you ask the expression of her face was strange but since when had awoman s at moments of supreme surrender not a right to be hetook it in with his own long look and his grateful silence sothat nothing more for some instants passed between them theirunderstanding sealed itself he already felt that she had madehim right but he was in presence too of the fact that maggie hadmade her so and always therefore without maggie where infine would he be she united them brought them together as withthe click of a silver spring and on the spot with the visionof it his eyes filled charlotte facing him meanwhile with herexpression made still stranger by the blur of his gratitude through it all however he smiled what my child does forme through it all as well that is still through the blur he sawcharlotte rather than heard her reply she held her paper wideopen but her eyes were all for his it isn t maggie it s theprince i say he gaily rang out then it s best of all it s enough thank you for thinking so to which he added it s enough forour question but it isn t is it quite enough for ourbreakfast dejeunons she stood there however in spite of this appeal her documentalways before them don t you want to read it he thought not if it satisfies you i don t require it but she gave him as for her conscience another chance you canif you like he hesitated afresh but as for amiability not for curiosity is it funny thus finally she again dropped her eyes on it drawing in herlips a little no i call it grave ah then i don t want it very grave said charlotte stant well what did i tell you of him he asked rejoicing as theystarted a question for all answer to which before she took hisarm the girl thrust her paper crumpled into the pocket of hercoat part thirdxivcharlotte half way up the monumental staircase had begun bywaiting alone waiting to be rejoined by her companion who hadgone down all the way as in common kindness bound and who hisduty performed would know where to find her she was meanwhile though extremely apparent not perhaps absolutely advertised butshe would not have cared if she had been so little was it bythis time her first occasion of facing society with aconsciousness materially with a confidence quite splendidly enriched for a couple of years now she had known as never beforewhat it was to look well to look that is as well as she hadalways felt from far back that in certain conditions shemight on such an evening as this that of a great official partyin the full flush of the london spring time the conditionsaffected her her nerves her senses her imagination as allprofusely present so that perhaps at no moment yet had she beenso justified of her faith as at the particular instant of ourbeing again concerned with her that of her chancing to glancehigher up from where she stood and meeting in consequence thequiet eyes of colonel assingham who had his elbows on the broadbalustrade of the great gallery overhanging the staircase and whoimmediately exchanged with her one of his most artlessly familiarsignals this simplicity of his visual attention struck her evenwith the other things she had to think about as the quietestnote in the whole high pitch much in fact as if she hadpressed a finger on a chord or a key and created for the numberof seconds an arrest of vibration a more muffled thump thesight of him suggested indeed that fanny would be there thoughso far as opportunity went she had not seen her this was aboutthe limit of what it could suggest the air however had suggestions enough it abounded in them many of them precisely helping to constitute those conditionswith which for our young woman the hour was brilliantlycrowned she was herself in truth crowned and it all hungtogether melted together in light and colour and sound theunsurpassed diamonds that her head so happily carried the otherjewels the other perfections of aspect and arrangement that madeher personal scheme a success the proved private theory thatmaterials to work with had been all she required and that therewere none too precious for her to understand and use to whichmight be added lastly as the strong scented flower of the totalsweetness an easy command a high enjoyment of her crisis fora crisis she was ready to take it and this ease it was doubtless that helped her while she waited to the rightassurance to the right indifference to the right expression and above all as she felt to the right view of her opportunityfor happiness unless indeed the opportunity itself rather were in its mere strange amplitude the producing theprecipitating cause the ordered revellers rustling and shining with sweep of train and glitter of star and clink of sword andyet for all this but so imperfectly articulate so vaguelyvocal the double stream of the coming and the going flowingtogether where she stood passed her brushed her treated her tomuch crude contemplation and now and then to a spasm of speech an offered hand even in some cases to an unencouraged pause butshe missed no countenance and invited no protection she fairlyliked to be so long as she might just as she was exposed alittle to the public no doubt in her unaccompanied state but even if it were a bit brazen careless of queer reflections onthe dull polish of london faces and exposed since it was aquestion of exposure to much more competent recognitions of herown she hoped no one would stop she was positively keepingherself it was her idea to mark in a particular manner theimportance of something that had just happened she knew how sheshould mark it and what she was doing there made already abeginning when presently therefore from her standpoint she saw theprince come back she had an impression of all the place as higherand wider and more appointed for great moments with its dome oflustres lifted its ascents and descents more majestic itsmarble tiers more vividly overhung its numerosity of royalties foreign and domestic more unprecedented its symbolism of state hospitality both emphasised and refined this wasdoubtless a large consequence of a fairly familiar cause aconsiderable inward stir to spring from the mere vision strikingas that might be of amerigo in a crowd but she had her reasons she held them there she carried them in fact responsibly andovertly as she carried her head her high tiara her folded fan her indifferent unattended eminence and it was when he reachedher and she could taking his arm show herself as placed in herrelation that she felt supremely justified it was her notion ofcourse that she gave a glimpse of but few of her grounds for thisdiscrimination indeed of the most evident alone yet she wouldhave been half willing it should be guessed how she drewinspiration drew support in quantity sufficient for almostanything from the individual value that through all thepicture her husband s son in law kept for the eye deriving itfrom his fine unconscious way in the swarming social sum ofoutshining overlooking and overtopping it was as if inseparation even the shortest she half forgot or disbelieved howhe affected her sight so that reappearance had in him eachtime a virtue of its own a kind of disproportionate intensitysuggesting his connection with occult sources of renewal whatdid he do when he was away from her that made him always comeback only looking as she would have called it more so superior to any shade of cabotinage he yet almostresembled an actor who between his moments on the stage revisits his dressing room and before the glass pressed by hisneed of effect retouches his make up the prince was at present for instance though he had quitted her but ten minutes before still more than then the person it pleased her to be left with atruth that had all its force for her while he made her his carefor their conspicuous return together to the upper rooms conspicuous beyond any wish they could entertain was what poorwonderful man he couldn t help making it and when she raisedher eyes again on the ascent to bob assingham still aloft inhis gallery and still looking down at her she was aware that inspite of hovering and warning inward voices she even enjoyed thetestimony rendered by his lonely vigil to the lustre shereflected he was always lonely at great parties the dear colonel itwasn t in such places that the seed he sowed at home was everreaped by him but nobody could have seemed to mind it less tobrave it with more bronzed indifference so markedly that hemoved about less like one of the guests than like some quitepresentable person in charge of the police arrangements or theelectric light to mrs verver as will be seen he represented with the perfect good faith of his apparent blankness somethingdefinite enough though her bravery was not thereby too blightedfor her to feel herself calling him to witness that the onlywitchcraft her companion had used within the few minutes wasthat of attending maggie who had withdrawn from the scene toher carriage notified at all events of fanny s probablepresence charlotte was for a while after this divided betweenthe sense of it as a fact somehow to reckon with and deal with which was a perception that made in its degree for theprudence the pusillanimity of postponement of avoidance and aquite other feeling an impatience that presently ended byprevailing an eagerness really to be suspected sounded veritably arraigned if only that she might have the bad momentover if only that she might prove to herself let alone tomrs assingham also that she could convert it to good if only in short to be square as they said with her question forherself indeed particularly it wasn t a question but somethingin her bones told her that fanny would treat it as one and therewas truly nothing that from this friend she was not bound indecency to take she might hand things back with every tenderprecaution with acknowledgments and assurances but she owed itto them in any case and it to all mrs assingham had done forher not to get rid of them without having well unwrapped andturned them over to night as happened and she recognised it more and more withthe ebbing minutes as an influence of everything about her to night exactly she would no doubt since she knew why be asfirm as she might at any near moment again hope to be for goingthrough that process with the right temper and tone she said after a little to the prince stay with me let no one takeyou for i want her yes i do want her to see us together andthe sooner the better said it to keep her hand on him throughconstant diversions and made him in fact by saying it professa momentary vagueness she had to explain to him that it wasfanny assingham she wanted to see who clearly would be there since the colonel never either stirred without her or oncearrived concerned himself for her fate and she had further after amerigo had met her with see us together why in theworld hasn t she often seen us together to inform him thatwhat had elsewhere and otherwise happened didn t now matter andthat she at any rate well knew for the occasion what she wasabout you re strange cara mia he consentingly enoughdropped but for whatever strangeness he kept her as theycirculated from being waylaid even remarking to her afresh ashe had often done before on the help rendered in suchsituations by the intrinsic oddity of the london squash athing of vague slow senseless eddies revolving as in fear ofsome menace of conversation suspended over it the drop of which with some consequent refreshing splash or spatter yet never tookplace of course she was strange this as they went charlotteknew for herself how could she be anything else when thesituation holding her and holding him for that matter just asmuch had so the stamp of it she had already accepted herconsciousness as we have already noted that a crisis for themall was in the air and when such hours were not depressing which was the form indeed in which she had mainly known them they were apparently in a high degree exhilarating later on in a corner to which at sight of an empty sofa mrs assingham had after a single attentive arrest led her with acertain earnestness this vision of the critical was much moresharpened than blurred fanny had taken it from her yes she wasthere with amerigo alone maggie having come with them and then within ten minutes changed her mind repented and departed soyou re staying on together without her the elder woman hadasked and it was charlotte s answer to this that had determinedfor them quite indeed according to the latter s expectation theneed of some seclusion and her companion s pounce at the sofa they were staying on together alone and oh distinctly it wasalone that maggie had driven away her father as usual nothaving managed to come as usual mrs assingham had seemedto wonder mr verver s reluctances not having she in fact quiteintimated hitherto struck her charlotte responded at any rate that his indisposition to go out had lately much increased eventhough to night as she admitted he had pleaded his not feelingwell maggie had wished to stay with him for the prince and she dining out had afterwards called in portland place whence inthe event they had brought her charlotte on maggie had comebut to oblige her father she had urged the two others to gowithout her then she had yielded for the time to mr verver spersuasion but here when they had after the long wait in thecarriage fairly got in here once up the stairs with the roomsbefore them remorse had ended by seizing her she had listenedto no other remonstrance and at present therefore as charlotteput it the two were doubtless making together a little party athome but it was all right so charlotte also put it there wasnothing in the world they liked better than these snatchedfelicities little parties long talks with i ll come to youto morrow and no i ll come to you make believe renewals oftheir old life they were fairly at times the dear things likechildren playing at paying visits playing at mr thompson and mrs fane each hoping that the other would really stay to tea charlotte was sure she should find maggie there on getting home a remark in which mrs verver s immediate response to herfriend s inquiry had culminated she had thus on the spot thesense of having given her plenty to think about and thatmoreover of liking to see it even better than she had expected she had plenty to think about herself and there was alreadysomething in fanny that made it seem still more you say your husband s ill he felt too ill to come no my dear i think not if he had been too ill i wouldn t haveleft him and yet maggie was worried mrs assingham asked she worries you know easily she s afraid of influenza ofwhich he has had at different times though never with the leastgravity several attacks but you re not afraid of it charlotte had for a moment a pause it had continued to come toher that really to have her case out as they said with theperson in the world to whom her most intimate difficulties hadoftenest referred themselves would help her on the whole morethan hinder and under that feeling all her opportunity withnothing kept back with a thing or two perhaps even thrustforward seemed temptingly to open besides didn t fanny atbottom half expect absolutely at the bottom half want things so that she would be disappointed if after what must just haveoccurred for her she didn t get something to put between theteeth of her so restless rumination that cultivation of thefear of which our young woman had already had glimpses that shemight have gone too far in her irrepressible interest in otherlives what had just happened it pieced itself together forcharlotte was that the assingham pair drifting like everyoneelse had had somewhere in the gallery in the rooms anaccidental concussion had it after the colonel over hisbalustrade had observed in the favouring high light her publicjunction with the prince his very dryness in this encounter had as always struck a spark from his wife s curiosity and familiar on his side with all that she saw in things he hadthrown her as a fine little bone to pick some report of the wayone of her young friends was going on with another he knewperfectly such at least was charlotte s liberal assumption thatshe wasn t going on with anyone but she also knew that giventhe circumstances she was inevitably to be sacrificed in someform or another to the humorous intercourse of the inimitablecouple the prince meanwhile had also under coercion sacrificedher the ambassador had come up to him with a message fromroyalty to whom he was led away after which she had talked forfive minutes with sir john brinder who had been of theambassador s company and who had rather artlessly remained withher fanny had then arrived in sight of them at the same momentas someone else she didn t know someone who knew mrs assinghamand also knew sir john charlotte had left it to her friend scompetence to throw the two others immediately together and tofind a way for entertaining her in closer quarters this was thelittle history of the vision in her that was now rapidlyhelping her to recognise a precious chance the chance thatmightn t again soon be so good for the vivid making of a point her point was before her it was sharp bright true above allit was her own she had reached it quite by herself no one noteven amerigo amerigo least of all who would have nothing to dowith it had given her aid to make it now with force for fannyassingham s benefit would see her further in the direction inwhich the light had dawned than any other spring she should yetawhile doubtless be able to press the direction was that ofher greater freedom which was all in the world she had in mind her opportunity had accordingly after a few minutes of mrs assingham s almost imprudently interested expression of face positively acquired such a price for her that she may forourselves while the intensity lasted rather resemble a personholding out a small mirror at arm s length and consulting itwith a special turn of the head it was in a word with thisvalue of her chance that she was intelligently playing when shesaid in answer to fanny s last question don t you remember whatyou told me on the occasion of something or other the otherday that you believe there s nothing i m afraid of so my dear don t ask me mayn t i ask you mrs assingham returned how the case standswith your poor husband certainly dear only when you ask me as if i mightn t perhapsknow what to think it seems to me best to let you see that iknow perfectly what to think mrs assingham hesitated then blinking a little she took herrisk you didn t think that if it was a question of anyone sreturning to him in his trouble it would be better you yourselfshould have gone well charlotte s answer to this inquiry visibly shaped itself inthe interest of the highest considerations the highestconsiderations were good humour candour clearness and obviously the real truth if we couldn t be perfectly frank anddear with each other it would be ever so much better wouldn tit that we shouldn t talk about anything at all which however would be dreadful and we certainly at any rate haven t yetcome to it you can ask me anything under the sun you like because don t you see you can t upset me i m sure my dear charlotte fanny assingham laughed i don twant to upset you indeed love you simply couldn t even if you thought itnecessary that s all i mean nobody could for it belongs to mysituation that i m by no merit of my own just fixed fixed asfast as a pin stuck up to its head in a cushion i m placed ican t imagine anyone more placed there i am fanny had indeed never listened to emphasis more firmly applied and it brought into her own eyes though she had reasons forstriving to keep them from betrayals a sort of anxiety ofintelligence i dare say but your statement of your position however you see it isn t an answer to my inquiry it seems tome at the same time i confess mrs assingham added to givebut the more reason for it you speak of our being frank howcan we possibly be anything else if maggie has gone off throughfinding herself too distressed to stay and if she s willing toleave you and her husband to show here without her aren t thegrounds of her preoccupation more or less discussable if they re not charlotte replied it s only from their being in a way too evident they re not grounds for me they weren twhen i accepted adam s preference that i should come to nightwithout him just as i accept absolutely as a fixed rule allhis preferences but that doesn t alter the fact of course thatmy husband s daughter rather than his wife should have felt shecould after all be the one to stay with him the one to makethe sacrifice of this hour seeing especially that the daughterhas a husband of her own in the field with which she produced as it were her explanation i ve simply to see the truth of thematter see that maggie thinks more on the whole of fathersthan of husbands and my situation is such she went on thatthis becomes immediately don t you understand a thing i have tocount with mrs assingham vaguely heaving panting a little but trying notto show it turned about from some inward spring in her seat if you mean such a thing as that she doesn t adore theprince i don t say she doesn t adore him what i say is that shedoesn t think of him one of those conditions doesn t always atall stages involve the other this is just how she adores him charlotte said and what reason is there in the world afterall why he and i shouldn t as you say show together we veshown together my dear she smiled before her friend for a little only looked at her speaking then withabruptness you ought to be absolutely happy you live with suchgood people the effect of it as well was an arrest for charlotte whoseface however all of whose fine and slightly hard radiance ithad caused the next instant further to brighten does one everput into words anything so fatuously rash it s a thing that mustbe said in prudence for one by somebody who s so good as totake the responsibility the more that it gives one always achance to show one s best manners by not contradicting it certainly you ll never have the distress or whatever ofhearing me complain truly my dear i hope in all conscience not and the elderwoman s spirit found relief in a laugh more resonant than wasquite advised by their pursuit of privacy to this demonstration her friend gave no heed with all ourabsence after marriage and with the separation from her producedin particular by our so many months in america maggie has stillarrears still losses to make up still the need of showing how for so long she simply kept missing him she missed hiscompany a large allowance of which is in spite of everythingelse of the first necessity to her so she puts it in when shecan a little here a little there and it ends by making up aconsiderable amount the fact of our distinct establishments which has all the same everything in its favour charlottehastened to declare makes her really see more of him than whenthey had the same house to make sure she doesn t fail of itshe s always arranging for it which she didn t have to do whilethey lived together but she likes to arrange charlottesteadily proceeded it peculiarly suits her and the result ofour separate households is really for them more contact andmore intimacy to night for instance has been practically anarrangement she likes him best alone and it s the way saidour young woman in which he best likes her it s what i meantherefore by being placed and the great thing is as they say to know one s place doesn t it all strike you she wound up as rather placing the prince too fanny assingham had at this moment the sense as of a large heapeddish presented to her intelligence and inviting it to a feast sothick were the notes of intention in this remarkable speech butshe also felt that to plunge at random to help herself toofreely would apart from there not being at such a moment timefor it tend to jostle the ministering hand confound the arrayand more vulgarly speaking make a mess so she picked out after consideration a solitary plum so placed that you have toarrange certainly i have to arrange and the prince also if the effect for him is the same really i think not less and does he arrange mrs assingham asked to make up hisarrears the question had risen to her lips it was as ifanother morsel on the dish had tempted her the sound of itstruck her own ear immediately as giving out more of herthought than she had as yet intended but she quickly saw thatshe must follow it up at any risk with simplicity and thatwhat was simplest was the ease of boldness make them up imean by coming to see you charlotte replied however without as her friend would havephrased it turning a hair she shook her head but it wasbeautifully gentle he never comes oh said fanny assingham with which she felt a little stupid there it is he might so well you know otherwise otherwise and fanny was still vague it passed this time over her companion whose eyes wandering to a distance found themselves held the prince was at handagain the ambassador was still at his side they were stopped amoment by a uniformed personage a little old man of apparentlythe highest military character bristling with medals and orders this gave charlotte time to go on he has not been for threemonths and then as with her friend s last word in her ear otherwise yes he arranges otherwise and in my position she added i might too it s too absurd we shouldn t meet you ve met i gather said fanny assingham to night yes as far as that goes but what i mean is that i might placed for it as we both are go to see him and do you fanny asked with almost mistaken solemnity the perception of this excess made charlotte whether for gravityor for irony hang fire a minute i have been but that snothing she said in itself and i tell you of it only to showyou how our situation works it essentially becomes one asituation for both of us the prince s however is his ownaffair i meant but to speak of mine your situation s perfect mrs assingham presently declared i don t say it isn t taken in fact all round i think it is and i don t as i tell you complain of it the only thing isthat i have to act as it demands of me to act said mrs assingham with an irrepressible quaver isn t it acting my dear to accept it i do accept it what doyou want me to do less i want you to believe that you re a very fortunate person do you call that less charlotte asked with a smile from thepoint of view of my freedom i call it more let it take myposition any name you like don t let it at any rate and mrs assingham s impatienceprevailed at last over her presence of mind don t let it makeyou think too much of your freedom i don t know what you call too much for how can i not see it asit is you d see your own quickly enough if the colonel gave youthe same liberty and i haven t to tell you with your so muchgreater knowledge of everything what it is that gives suchliberty most for yourself personally of course charlotte wenton you only know the state of neither needing it nor missingit your husband doesn t treat you as of less importance to himthan some other woman ah don t talk to me of other women fanny now overtly panted do you call mr verver s perfectly natural interest in hisdaughter the greatest affection of which he is capable charlotte tookit up in all readiness i do distinctly and in spite of myhaving done all i could think of to make him capable of agreater i ve done earnestly everything i could i ve made it month after month my study but i haven t succeeded it has beenvividly brought home to me to night however she pursued i vehoped against hope for i recognise that as i told you at thetime i was duly warned and then as she met in her friend sface the absence of any such remembrance he did tell me that hewanted me just because i could be useful about her with whichcharlotte broke into a wonderful smile so you see i am it was on fanny assingham s lips for the moment to reply thatthis was on the contrary exactly what she didn t see she camein fact within an ace of saying you strike me as having quitefailed to help his idea to work since by your account maggiehas him not less but so much more on her mind how in theworld with so much of a remedy comes there to remain so much ofwhat was to be obviated but she saved herself in time conscious above all that she was in presence of still deeperthings than she had yet dared to fear that there was more init than any admission she had made represented and she had heldherself familiar with admissions so that not to seem tounderstand where she couldn t accept and not to seem to acceptwhere she couldn t approve and could still less withprecipitation advise she invoked the mere appearance of castingno weight whatever into the scales of her young friend sconsistency the only thing was that as she was quickly enoughto feel she invoked it rather to excess it brought her her invocation too abruptly to her feet she brushed awayeverything i can t conceive my dear what you re talkingabout charlotte promptly rose then as might be to meet it and hercolour for the first time perceptibly heightened she looked for the minute as her companion had looked as if twentyprotests blocking each other s way had surged up within her but when charlotte had to make a selection her selection wasalways the most effective possible it was happy now above all for being made not in anger but in sorrow you give me up then give you up you forsake me at the hour of my life when it seems to me i mostdeserve a friend s loyalty if you do you re not just fanny you re even i think she went on rather cruel and it s leastof all worthy of you to seem to wish to quarrel with me in orderto cover your desertion she spoke at the same time with thenoblest moderation of tone and the image of high pale lighteddisappointment she meanwhile presented as of a creature patientand lonely in her splendour was an impression so firmly imposedthat she could fill her measure to the brim and yet enjoy thelast word as it is called in such cases with a perfection voidof any vulgarity of triumph she merely completed for truth ssake her demonstration what is a quarrel with me but a quarrelwith my right to recognise the conditions of my bargain buti can carry them out alone she said as she turned away sheturned to meet the ambassador and the prince who their colloquywith their field marshal ended were now at hand and had already between them she was aware addressed her a remark that failedto penetrate the golden glow in which her intelligence wastemporarily bathed she had made her point the point she hadforeseen she must make she had made it thoroughly and once forall so that no more making was required and her success wasreflected in the faces of the two men of distinction before her unmistakably moved to admiration by her exceptional radiance sheat first but watched this reflection taking no note of any lessadequate form of it possibly presented by poor fanny poor fannyleft to stare at her incurred score chalked up in so fewstrokes on the wall then she took in what the ambassador wassaying in french what he was apparently repeating to her a desire for your presence madame has been expressed entres haut lieu and i ve let myself in for the responsibility tosay nothing of the honour of seeing as the most respectful ofyour friends that so august an impatience is not kept waiting the greatest possible personage had in short according to theodd formula of societies subject to the greatest personagespossible sent for her and she asked in her surprise whatin the world does he want to do to me only to know withoutlooking that fanny s bewilderment was called to a still largerapplication and to hear the prince say with authority indeedwith a certain prompt dryness you must go immediately it s asummons the ambassador using authority as well had alreadysomehow possessed himself of her hand which he drew into hisarm and she was further conscious as she went off with him that though still speaking for her benefit amerigo had turned tofanny assingham he would explain afterwards besides which shewould understand for herself to fanny however he had laughed as a mark apparently that for this infallible friend noexplanation at all would be necessary xvit may be recorded none the less that the prince was the nextmoment to see how little any such assumption was founded alonewith him now mrs assingham was incorruptible they send forcharlotte through you no my dear as you see through the ambassador ah but the ambassador and you for the last quarter of an hour have been for them as one he s your ambassador it may indeedbe further mentioned that the more fanny looked at it the moreshe saw in it they ve connected her with you she s treated asyour appendage oh my appendage the prince amusedly exclaimed cara mia what a name she s treated rather say as my ornament and myglory and it s so remarkable a case for a mother in law that yousurely can t find fault with it you ve ornaments enough it seems to me as you ve certainlyglories enough without her and she s not the least little bit mrs assingham observed your mother in law in such a matter ashade of difference is enormous she s no relation to youwhatever and if she s known in high quarters but as going aboutwith you then then she failed however as from positiveintensity of vision then then what he asked with perfectgood nature she had better in such a case not be known at all but i assure you i never just now so much as mentioned her doyou suppose i asked them said the young man still amused ifthey didn t want to see her you surely don t need to be shownthat charlotte speaks for herself that she does so above all onsuch an occasion as this and looking as she does to night how so looking can she pass unnoticed how can she not have success besides he added as she but watched his face letting him say what he would as if she wanted to see how hewould say it besides there is always the fact that we re ofthe same connection of what is your word the same concern we re certainly not with the relation of our respective sposi simply formal acquaintances we re in the same boat and theprince smiled with a candour that added an accent to hisemphasis fanny assingham was full of the special sense of his manner itcaused her to turn for a moment s refuge to a corner of hergeneral consciousness in which she could say to herself that shewas glad she wasn t in love with such a man as with charlottejust before she was embarrassed by the difference between whatshe took in and what she could say what she felt and what shecould show it only appears to me of great importance that nowthat you all seem more settled here charlotte should be known for any presentation any further circulation or introduction as in particular her husband s wife known in the leastpossible degree as anything else i don t know what you mean bythe same boat charlotte is naturally in mr verver s boat and pray am i not in mr verver s boat too why but for mr verver s boat i should have been by this time and his quickitalian gesture an expressive direction and motion of hisforefinger pointed to deepest depths away down down down she knew of course what he meant how it had taken hisfather in law s great fortune and taken no small slice tosurround him with an element in which all too fatally weightedas he had originally been he could pecuniarily float and withthis reminder other things came to her how strange it was that with all allowance for their merit it should befall some peopleto be so inordinately valued quoted as they said in thestock market so high and how still stranger perhaps thatthere should be cases in which for some reason one didn t mindthe so frequently marked absence in them of the purpose really torepresent their price she was thinking feeling at any rate for herself she was thinking that the pleasure she could take inthis specimen of the class didn t suffer from his consent to bemerely made buoyant partly because it was one of those pleasures he inspired them that by their nature couldn t suffer towhatever proof they were put and partly because besides heafter all visibly had on his conscience some sort of return forservices rendered he was a huge expense assuredly but it hadbeen up to now her conviction that his idea was to behavebeautifully enough to make the beauty well nigh an equivalent and that he had carried out his idea carried it out bycontinuing to lead the life to breathe the air very nearly tothink the thoughts that best suited his wife and her father this she had till lately enjoyed the comfort of so distinctlyperceiving as to have even been moved more than once to expressto him the happiness it gave her he had that in his favour asagainst other matters yet it discouraged her too and ratheroddly that he should so keep moving and be able to show herthat he moved on the firm ground of the truth hisacknowledgment of obligation was far from unimportant but shecould find in his grasp of the real itself a kind of ominousintimation the intimation appeared to peep at her even out ofhis next word lightly as he produced it isn t it rather as if we had charlotte and i for bringing ustogether a benefactor in common and the effect for hisinterlocutress was still further to be deepened i somehowfeel half the time as if he were her father in law too it s asif he had saved us both which is a fact in our lives or at anyrate in our hearts to make of itself a link don t youremember he kept it up how the day she suddenly turned upfor you just before my wedding we so frankly and funnilytalked in her presence of the advisability for her of somegood marriage and then as his friend s face in her extremity quite again as with charlotte but continued to fly the blackflag of general repudiation well we really began then as itseems to me the work of placing her where she is we were whollyright and so was she that it was exactly the thing is shown byits success we recommended a good marriage at almost any price so to speak and taking us at our word she has made the verybest that was really what we meant wasn t it only what shehas got something thoroughly good it would be difficult itseems to me for her to have anything better once you allow herthe way it s to be taken of course if you don t allow her thatthe case is different her offset is a certain decent freedom which i judge she ll be quite contented with you may say thatwill be very good of her but she strikes me as perfectly humbleabout it she proposes neither to claim it nor to use it with anysort of retentissement she would enjoy it i think quite asquietly as it might be given the boat you see the princeexplained it no less considerately and lucidly is a good dealtied up at the dock or anchored if you like out in the stream i have to jump out from time to time to stretch my legs andyou ll probably perceive if you give it your attention thatcharlotte really can t help occasionally doing the same it isn teven a question sometimes of one s getting to the dock one hasto take a header and splash about in the water call our havingremained here together to night call the accident of my havingput them put our illustrious friends there on my companion strack for i grant you this as a practical result of ourcombination call the whole thing one of the harmless littleplunges off the deck inevitable for each of us why not takethem when they occur as inevitable and above all as notendangering life or limb we shan t drown we shan t sink atleast i can answer for myself mrs verver too moreover do herthe justice visibly knows how to swim he could easily go on for she didn t interrupt him fanny feltnow that she wouldn t have interrupted him for the world shefound his eloquence precious there was not a drop of it that shedidn t in a manner catch as it came for immediate bottling for future preservation the crystal flask of her innermostattention really received it on the spot and she had evenalready the vision of how in the snug laboratory of herafterthought she should be able chemically to analyse it therewere moments positively still beyond this when with themeeting of their eyes something as yet unnamable came out forher in his look when something strange and subtle and atvariance with his words something that gave them away glimmereddeep down as an appeal almost an incredible one to her finercomprehension what inconceivably was it like wasn t it however gross such a rendering of anything so occult fairlylike a quintessential wink a hint of the possibility of theirreally treating their subject of course on some betteroccasion and thereby as well finding it much more interesting if this far red spark which might have been figured by her mindas the head light of an approaching train seen through the lengthof a tunnel was not on her side an ignis fatuus a meresubjective phenomenon it twinkled there at the direct expense ofwhat the prince was inviting her to understand meanwhile too however and unmistakably the real treatment of their subjectdid at a given moment sound this was when he proceeded withjust the same perfect possession of his thought on the manner ofwhich he couldn t have improved to complete his successfulsimile by another in fact by just the supreme touch the touchfor which it had till now been waiting for mrs verver to beknown to people so intensely and exclusively as her husband swife something is wanted that you know they haven t exactlygot he should manage to be known or at least to be seen alittle more as his wife s husband you surely must by this timehave seen for yourself that he has his own habits and his ownways and that he makes more and more as of course he has aperfect right to do his own discriminations he s so perfect soideal a father and doubtless largely by that very fact agenerous a comfortable an admirable father in law that ishould really feel it base to avail myself of any standpointwhatever to criticise him to you nevertheless i may make justone remark for you re not stupid you always understand soblessedly what one means he paused an instant as if even this one remark might bedifficult for him should she give no sign of encouraging him toproduce it nothing would have induced her however to encouragehim she was now conscious of having never in her life stood sostill or sat inwardly as it were so tight she felt like thehorse of the adage brought and brought by her own fault to thewater but strong for the occasion in the one fact that shecouldn t be forced to drink invited in other words tounderstand she held her breath for fear of showing she did andthis for the excellent reason that she was at last fairly afraidto it was sharp for her at the same time that she was certain in advance of his remark that she heard it before it hadsounded that she already tasted in fine the bitterness itwould have for her special sensibility but her companion froman inward and different need of his own was presently notdeterred by her silence what i really don t see is why fromhis own point of view given that is his conditions sofortunate as they stood he should have wished to marry at all there it was then exactly what she knew would come and exactly for reasons that seemed now to thump at her heart as distressingto her yet she was resolved meanwhile not to suffer as theyused to say of the martyrs then and there not to suffer odiously helplessly in public which could be prevented but byher breaking off with whatever inconsequence by her treatingtheir discussion as ended and getting away she suddenly wantedto go home much as she had wanted an hour or two before tocome she wanted to leave well behind her both her question andthe couple in whom it had abruptly taken such vivid form butit was dreadful to have the appearance of disconcerted flight discussion had of itself to her sense become danger suchlight as from open crevices it let in and the overtrecognition of danger was worse than anything else the worst infact came while she was thinking how she could retreat and stillnot overtly recognise her face had betrayed her trouble andwith that she was lost i m afraid however the prince said that i for some reason distress you for which i beg yourpardon we ve always talked so well together it has been fromthe beginning the greatest pull for me nothing so much as sucha tone could have quickened her collapse she felt he had her nowat his mercy and he showed as he went on that he knew it weshall talk again all the same better than ever i depend on ittoo much don t you remember what i told you so definitely oneday before my marriage that moving as i did in so many waysamong new things mysteries conditions expectations assumptions different from any i had known i looked to you asmy original sponsor my fairy godmother to see me through i begyou to believe he added that i look to you yet his very insistence had fortunately the next moment affectedher as bringing her help with which at least she could hold upher head to speak ah you are through you were through longago or if you aren t you ought to be well then if i ought to be it s all the more reason why youshould continue to help me because very distinctly i assureyou i m not the new things or ever so many of them are stillfor me new things the mysteries and expectations and assumptionsstill contain an immense element that i ve failed to puzzle out as we ve happened so luckily to find ourselves again reallytaking hold together you must let me as soon as possible cometo see you you must give me a good kind hour if you refuse itme and he addressed himself to her continued reserve i shallfeel that you deny with a stony stare your responsibility at this as from a sudden shake her reserve proved an inadequatevessel she could bear her own her private reference to theweight on her mind but the touch of another hand made it toohorribly press oh i deny responsibility to you so far as iever had it i ve done with it he had been all the while beautifully smiling but she made hislook now penetrate her again more as to whom then do youconfess it ah mio caro that s if to anyone my own business he continued to look at her hard you give me up then it was what charlotte had asked her ten minutes before and itscoming from him so much in the same way shook her in her place she was on the point of replying do you and she agree togetherfor what you ll say to me but she was glad afterwards to havechecked herself in time little as her actual answer had perhapsbettered it i think i don t know what to make of you you must receive me at least he said oh please not till i m ready for you and though she founda laugh for it she had to turn away she had never turned awayfrom him before and it was quite positively for her as if shewere altogether afraid of him xvilater on when their hired brougham had with the longvociferation that tormented her impatience been extricated fromthe endless rank she rolled into the london night beside herhusband as into a sheltering darkness where she could muffleherself and draw breath she had stood for the previous half hourin a merciless glare beaten upon stared out of countenance itfairly seemed to her by intimations of her mistake for what shewas most immediately feeling was that she had in the past beenactive for these people to ends that were now bearing fruit andthat might yet bear a larger crop she but brooded at first inher corner of the carriage it was like burying her exposed face a face too helplessly exposed in the cool lap of the commonindifference of the dispeopled streets of the closed shops anddarkened houses seen through the window of the brougham a worldmercifully unconscious and unreproachful it wouldn t like theworld she had just left know sooner or later what she had done or would know it at least only if the final consequence shouldbe some quite overwhelming publicity she fixed this possibilityitself so hard however for a few moments that the misery ofher fear produced the next minute a reaction and when thecarriage happened while it grazed a turn to catch the straightshaft from the lamp of a policeman in the act of playing hisinquisitive flash over an opposite house front she let herselfwince at being thus incriminated only that she might protest notless quickly against mere blind terror it had become for theoccasion preposterously terror of which she must shake herselffree before she could properly measure her ground the perceptionof this necessity had in truth soon aided her since she found on trying that lurid as her prospect might hover there shecould none the less give it no name the sense of seeing wasstrong in her but she clutched at the comfort of not being sureof what she saw not to know what it would represent on a longerview was a help in turn to not making out that her hands wereembrued since if she had stood in the position of a producingcause she should surely be less vague about what she hadproduced this further in its way was a step toward reflectingthat when one s connection with any matter was too indirect to betraced it might be described also as too slight to be deplored by the time they were nearing cadogan place she had in factrecognised that she couldn t be as curious as she desired withoutarriving at some conviction of her being as innocent but there had been a moment in the dim desert of eaton square when shebroke into speech it s only their defending themselves so much more than theyneed it s only that that makes me wonder it s their having soremarkably much to say for themselves her husband had as usual lighted his cigar remainingapparently as busy with it as she with her agitation you meanit makes you feel that you have nothing to which as she madeno answer the colonel added what in the world did you eversuppose was going to happen the man s in a position in which hehas nothing in life to do her silence seemed to characterise this statement as superficial and her thoughts as always in her husband s company pursued anindependent course he made her when they were together talk but as if for some other person who was in fact for the mostpart herself yet she addressed herself with him as she couldnever have done without him he has behaved beautifully he didfrom the first i ve thought it all along wonderful of him andi ve more than once when i ve had a chance told him so therefore therefore but it died away as she mused therefore he has a right for a change to kick up his heels it isn t a question of course however she undivertedly wenton of their behaving beautifully apart it s a question oftheir doing as they should when together which is anothermatter and how do you think then the colonel asked with interest that when together they should do the less they do one wouldsay the better if you see so much in it his wife at this appeared to hear him i don t see in it whatyou d see and don t my dear she further answered think itnecessary to be horrid or low about them they re the lastpeople really to make anything of that sort come in right i m surely never horrid or low he returned about anyone butmy extravagant wife i can do with all our friends as i see themmyself what i can t do with is the figures you make of them andwhen you take to adding your figures up but he exhaled itagain in smoke my additions don t matter when you ve not to pay the bill withwhich her meditation again bore her through the air the greatthing was that when it so suddenly came up for her he wasn tafraid if he had been afraid he could perfectly have preventedit and if i had seen he was if i hadn t seen he wasn t so said mrs assingham could i so she declared would i it sperfectly true she went on it was too good a thing for her such a chance in life not to be accepted and i liked his notkeeping her out of it merely from a fear of his own nature itwas so wonderful it should come to her the only thing would havebeen if charlotte herself couldn t have faced it then if shehad not had confidence we might have talked but she had it toany amount did you ask her how much bob assingham patiently inquired he had put the question with no more than his usual modest hopeof reward but he had pressed this time the sharpest spring ofresponse never never it wasn t a time to ask asking issuggesting and it wasn t a time to suggest one had to make upone s mind as quietly as possible by what one could judge andi judge as i say that charlotte felt she could face it forwhich she struck me at the time as for so proud a creature almost touchingly grateful the thing i should never forgive herfor would be her forgetting to whom it is her thanks haveremained most due that is to mrs assingham she said nothing for a little there were after all alternatives maggie herself of course astonishing littlemaggie is maggie then astonishing too and he gloomed out of hiswindow his wife on her side now as they rolled projected the samelook i m not sure that i don t begin to see more in her than dear little person as i ve always thought i ever supposed therewas i m not sure that putting a good many things together i mnot beginning to make her out rather extraordinary you certainly will if you can the colonel resignedly remarked again his companion said nothing then again she broke out infact i do begin to feel it maggie s the great comfort i mgetting hold of it it will be she who ll see us through in factshe ll have to and she ll be able touch by touch her meditation had completed it but with acumulative effect for her husband s general sense of her methodthat caused him to overflow whimsically enough in his corner into an ejaculation now frequent on his lips for the relief that especially in communion like the present it gave him and thatfanny had critically traced to the quaint example the aboriginalhomeliness still so delightful of mr verver oh lordy lordy if she is however mrs assingham continued she ll beextraordinary enough and that s what i m thinking of but i mnot indeed so very sure she added of the person to whomcharlotte ought in decency to be most grateful i mean i m notsure if that person is even almost the incredible little idealistwho has made her his wife i shouldn t think you would be love the colonel with somepromptness responded charlotte as the wife of an incrediblelittle idealist his cigar in short once more could aloneexpress it yet what is that when one thinks but just what she struck oneas more or less persuaded that she herself was really going tobe this memory for the full view fanny found herself alsoinvoking it made her companion in truth slightly gape an incrediblelittle idealist charlotte herself and she was sincere his wife simply proceeded she wasunmistakably sincere the question is only how much is left ofit and that i see happens to be another of the questions youcan t ask her you have to do it all said bob assingham as ifyou were playing some game with its rules drawn up though who sto come down on you if you break them i don t quite see or mustyou do it in three guesses like forfeits on christmas eve towhich as his ribaldry but dropped from her he further added how much of anything will have to be left for you to be able togo on with it i shall go on fanny assingham a trifle grimly declared whilethere s a scrap as big as your nail but we re not yet luckily reduced only to that she had another pause holding the whilethe thread of that larger perception into which her view of mrs verver s obligation to maggie had suddenly expanded even if herdebt was not to the others even then it ought to be quitesufficiently to the prince himself to keep her straight forwhat really did the prince do she asked herself butgenerously trust her what did he do but take it from her that ifshe felt herself willing it was because she felt herself strong that creates for her upon my word mrs assingham pursued aduty of considering him of honourably repaying his trust which well which she ll be really a fiend if she doesn t make thelaw of her conduct i mean of course his trust that she wouldn tinterfere with him expressed by his holding himself quiet at thecritical time the brougham was nearing home and it was perhaps this sense ofebbing opportunity that caused the colonel s next meditation toflower in a fashion almost surprising to his wife they wereunited for the most part but by his exhausted patience so thatindulgent despair was generally at the best his note he atpresent however actually compromised with his despair to theextent of practically admitting that he had followed her steps he literally asked in short an intelligent well nigh asympathising question gratitude to the prince for not havingput a spoke in her wheel that you mean should taking it inthe right way be precisely the ballast of her boat taking it in the right way fanny catching at this gleam emphasised the proviso but doesn t it rather depend on what she may most feel to be theright way no it depends on nothing because there s only one way forduty or delicacy oh delicacy bob assingham rather crudely murmured i mean the highest kind moral charlotte s perfectly capable ofappreciating that by every dictate of moral delicacy she mustlet him alone then you ve made up your mind it s all poor charlotte he askedwith an effect of abruptness the effect whether intended or not reached her brought herface short round it was a touch at which she again lost herbalance at which somehow the bottom dropped out of herrecovered comfort then you ve made up yours differently itreally struck you that there is something the movement itself apparently made him once more stand off hehad felt on his nearer approach the high temperature of thequestion perhaps that s just what she s doing showing him howmuch she s letting him alone pointing it out to him from day today did she point it out by waiting for him to night on the stair case in the manner you described to me i really my dear described to you a manner the colonel clearly from want of habit scarce recognised himself in theimputation yes for once in a way in those few words we had after you hadwatched them come up you told me something of what you had seen you didn t tell me very much that you couldn t for your life but i saw for myself that strange to say you had received yourimpression and i felt therefore that there must indeed have beensomething out of the way for you so to betray it she was fullyupon him now and she confronted him with his proved sensibilityto the occasion confronted him because of her own uneasy need toprofit by it it came over her still more than at the time itcame over her that he had been struck with something even he poor dear man and that for this to have occurred there must havebeen much to be struck with she tried in fact to corner him topack him insistently down in the truth of his plain vision thevery plainness of which was its value for so recorded she felt none of it would escape she should have it at hand forreference come my dear you thought what you thought in thepresence of what you saw you couldn t resist thinking i don task more of it than that and your idea is worth this time quite as much as any of mine so that you can t pretend asusual that mine has run away with me i haven t caught up withyou i stay where i am but i see she concluded where youare and i m much obliged to you for letting me you give me apoint de repere outside myself which is where i like it now ican work round you their conveyance as she spoke stopped at their door and itwas on the spot another fact of value for her that her husband though seated on the side by which they must alight made nomovement they were in a high degree votaries of the latch key so that their household had gone to bed and as they wereunaccompanied by a footman the coachman waited in peace it wasso indeed that for a minute bob assingham waited conscious of areason for replying to this address otherwise than by the soobvious method of turning his back he didn t turn his face buthe stared straight before him and his wife had already perceivedin the fact of his not moving all the proof she could desire proof that is of her own contention she knew he never caredwhat she said and his neglect of his chance to show it wasthereby the more eloquent leave it he at last remarked tothem leave it she wondered let them alone they ll manage they ll manage you mean to do everything they want ah therethen you are they ll manage in their own way the colonel almost crypticallyrepeated it had its effect for her quite apart from its light on thefamiliar phenomenon of her husband s indurated conscience itgave her full in her face the particular evocation of which shehad made him guilty it was wonderful truly then the evocation so cleverly that s your idea that no one will be the wiser it s your idea that we shall have done all that s required of usif we simply protect them the colonel still in his place declined however to be drawninto a statement of his idea statements were too much liketheories in which one lost one s way he only knew what he said and what he said represented the limited vibration of which hisconfirmed old toughness had been capable still none the less he had his point to make for which he took another instant buthe made it for the third time in the same fashion they llmanage in their own way with which he got out oh yes at this for his companion it had indeed its effect andwhile he mounted their steps she but stared without followinghim at his opening of their door their hall was lighted and ashe stood in the aperture looking back at her his tall leanfigure outlined in darkness and with his crush hat according tohis wont worn cavalierly rather diabolically askew he seemedto prolong the sinister emphasis of his meaning in general onthese returns he came back for her when he had prepared theirentrance so that it was now as if he were ashamed to face her incloser quarters he looked at her across the interval and stillin her seat weighing his charge she felt her whole view ofeverything flare up wasn t it simply what had been written inthe prince s own face beneath what he was saying didn t itcorrespond with the mocking presence there that she had had hertroubled glimpse of wasn t in fine the pledge that they would manage in their own way the thing he had been feeling for hischance to invite her to take from him her husband s tone somehowfitted amerigo s look the one that had for her so strangely peeped from behind over the shoulder of the one in front shehad not then read it but wasn t she reading it when she now sawin it his surmise that she was perhaps to be squared she wasn tto be squared and while she heard her companion call across toher well what s the matter she also took time to remindherself that she had decided she couldn t be frightened the matter why it was sufficiently the matter with all this that she felt a little sick for it was not the prince that shehad been prepared to regard as primarily the shaky one shakinessin charlotte she had at the most perhaps postulated it wouldbe she somehow felt more easy to deal with therefore if he hadcome so far it was a different pair of sleeves there was nothingto choose between them it made her so helpless that as the timepassed without her alighting the colonel came back and fairlydrew her forth after which on the pavement under thestreet lamp their very silence might have been the mark ofsomething grave their silence eked out for her by his giving herhis arm and their then crawling up their steps quite mildly andunitedly together like some old darby and joan who have had adisappointment it almost resembled a return from a funeral unless indeed it resembled more the hushed approach to a house ofmourning what indeed had she come home for but to bury asdecently as possible her mistake xviiit appeared thus that they might enjoy together extraordinaryfreedom the two friends from the moment they should understandtheir position aright with the prince himself from an earlystage not unnaturally charlotte had made a great point of theirso understanding it she had found frequent occasion to describeto him this necessity and her resignation tempered or herintelligence at least quickened by irrepressible irony sheapplied at different times different names to the propriety oftheir case the wonderful thing was that her sense of proprietyhad been from the first especially alive about it there werehours when she spoke of their taking refuge in what she calledthe commonest tact as if this principle alone would suffice tolight their way there were others when it might have seemed tolisten to her that their course would demand of them the mostanxious study and the most independent not to say original interpretation of signs she talked now as if it were indicated at every turn by finger posts of almost ridiculous prominence she talked again as if it lurked in devious ways and were to betracked through bush and briar and she even on occasion delivered herself in the sense that as their situation wasunprecedented so their heaven was without stars do sheonce had echoed to him as the upshot of passages covertly thoughbriefly occurring between them on her return from the visit toamerica that had immediately succeeded her marriage determinedfor her by this event as promptly as an excursion of the likestrange order had been prescribed in his own case isn t theimmense the really quite matchless beauty of our position thatwe have to do nothing in life at all nothing except theusual necessary everyday thing which consists in one s notbeing more of a fool than one can help that s all but that s astrue for one time as for another there has been plenty of doing and there will doubtless be plenty still but it s alltheirs every inch of it it s all a matter of what they ve doneto us and she showed how the question had therefore been onlyof their taking everything as everything came and all as quietlyas might be nothing stranger surely had ever happened to aconscientious a well meaning a perfectly passive pair no moreextraordinary decree had ever been launched against such victimsthan this of forcing them against their will into a relation ofmutual close contact that they had done everything to avoid she was to remember not a little meanwhile the particularprolonged silent look with which the prince had met her allusionto these primary efforts at escape she was inwardly to dwell onthe element of the unuttered that her tone had caused to play upinto his irresistible eyes and this because she considered withpride and joy that she had on the spot disposed of the doubt the question the challenge or whatever else might have been that such a look could convey he had been sufficiently off hisguard to show some little wonder as to their having plotted sovery hard against their destiny and she knew well enough ofcourse what in this connection was at the bottom of histhought and what would have sounded out more or less if he hadnot happily saved himself from words all men were brutes enoughto catch when they might at such chances for dissent for all thegood it really did them but the prince s distinction was inbeing one of the few who could check himself before acting on theimpulse this obviously was what counted in a man as delicacy if her friend had blurted or bungled he would have said in hissimplicity did we do everything to avoid it when we facedyour remarkable marriage quite handsomely of course using theplural taking his share of the case by way of a tribute ofmemory to the telegram she had received from him in paris aftermr verver had despatched to rome the news of their engagement that telegram that acceptance of the prospect proposed to them an acceptance quite other than perfunctory she had neverdestroyed though reserved for no eyes but her own it was stillcarefully reserved she kept it in a safe place from which veryprivately she sometimes took it out to read it over a laguerre comme a la guerre then it had been couched in the frenchtongue we must lead our lives as we see them but i am charmedwith your courage and almost surprised at my own the messagehad remained ambiguous she had read it in more lights than one it might mean that even without her his career was up hill workfor him a daily fighting matter on behalf of a good appearance and that thus if they were to become neighbours again the eventwould compel him to live still more under arms it might mean onthe other hand that he found he was happy enough and thataccordingly so far as she might imagine herself a danger shewas to think of him as prepared in advance as really seasonedand secure on his arrival in paris with his wife none the less she had asked for no explanation just as he himself had notasked if the document were still in her possession such aninquiry everything implied was beneath him just as it wasbeneath herself to mention to him uninvited that she hadinstantly offered and in perfect honesty to show the telegramto mr verver and that if this companion had but said the wordshe would immediately have put it before him she had therebyforborne to call his attention to her consciousness that such anexposure would in all probability straightway have dished hermarriage that all her future had in fact for the moment hungby the single hair of mr verver s delicacy as she supposed theymust call it and that her position in the matter ofresponsibility was therefore inattackably straight for the prince himself meanwhile time in its measuredallowance had originally much helped him helped him in thesense of there not being enough of it to trip him up in spite ofwhich it was just this accessory element that seemed at present with wonders of patience to lie in wait time had begotten atfirst more than anything else separations delays andintervals but it was troublesomely less of an aid from themoment it began so to abound that he had to meet the question ofwhat to do with it less of it was required for the state ofbeing married than he had on the whole expected less strangely for the state of being married even as he was married and there was a logic in the matter he knew a logic that butgave this truth a sort of solidity of evidence mr verver decidedly helped him with it with his wedded condition helpedhim really so much that it made all the difference in the degreein which he rendered it the service on mr verver s part wasremarkable as indeed what service from the first of theirmeeting had not been he was living he had been living thesefour or five years on mr verver s services a truth scarcelyless plain if he dealt with them for appreciation one by one than if he poured them all together into the general pot of hisgratitude and let the thing simmer to a nourishing broth to thelatter way with them he was undoubtedly most disposed yet hewould even thus on occasion pick out a piece to taste on itsown merits wondrous at such hours could seem the savour of theparticular treat at his father in law s expense that he moreand more struck himself as enjoying he had needed months andmonths to arrive at a full appreciation he couldn t originallyhave given offhand a name to his deepest obligation but by thetime the name had flowered in his mind he was practically livingat the ease guaranteed him mr verver then in a word took careof his relation to maggie as he took care and apparently alwayswould of everything else he relieved him of all anxiety abouthis married life in the same manner in which he relieved him onthe score of his bank account and as he performed the latteroffice by communicating with the bankers so the former sprang asdirectly from his good understanding with his daughter thisunderstanding had wonderfully that was in high evidence thesame deep intimacy as the commercial the financial associationfounded far down on a community of interest and thecorrespondence for the prince carried itself out in identitiesof character the vision of which fortunately rather tended toamuse than to as might have happened irritate him thosepeople and his free synthesis lumped together capitalists andbankers retired men of business illustrious collectors american fathers in law american fathers little americandaughters little american wives those people were of the samelarge lucky group as one might say they were all at least ofthe same general species and had the same general instincts theyhung together they passed each other the word they spoke eachother s language they did each other turns in this lastconnection it of course came up for our young man at a givenmoment that maggie s relation with him was also on the perceivedbasis taken care of which was in fact the real upshot of thematter it was a funny situation that is it was funny just asit stood their married life was in question but the solutionwas not less strikingly before them it was all right forhimself because mr verver worked it so for maggie s comfort and it was all right for maggie because he worked it so for herhusband s the fact that time however was not as we have said wholly onthe prince s side might have shown for particularly true one darkday on which by an odd but not unprecedented chance thereflections just noted offered themselves as his main recreation they alone it appeared had been appointed to fill the hours forhim and even to fill the great square house in portland place where the scale of one of the smaller saloons fitted them butloosely he had looked into this room on the chance that he mightfind the princess at tea but though the fireside service of therepast was shiningly present the mistress of the table was not and he had waited for her if waiting it could be called whilehe measured again and again the stretch of polished floor hecould have named to himself no pressing reason for seeing her atthis moment and her not coming in as the half hour elapsed became in fact quite positively however perversely thecircumstance that kept him on the spot just there he might havebeen feeling just there he could best take his note thisobservation was certainly by itself meagre amusement for a drearylittle crisis but his walk to and fro and in particular hisrepeated pause at one of the high front windows gave each of theebbing minutes none the less after a time a little more of thequality of a quickened throb of the spirit these throbs scarceexpressed however the impatience of desire any more than theystood for sharp disappointment the series together resembledperhaps more than anything else those fine waves of clearnessthrough which for a watcher of the east dawn at last tremblesinto rosy day the illumination indeed was all for the mind theprospect revealed by it a mere immensity of the world of thought the material outlook was all the while a different matter themarch afternoon judged at the window had blundered back intoautumn it had been raining for hours and the colour of therain the colour of the air of the mud of the opposite houses of life altogether in so grim a joke so idiotic a masquerade was an unutterable dirty brown there was at first even for theyoung man no faint flush in the fact of the direction taken while he happened to look out by a slow jogging four wheeled cabwhich awkwardly deflecting from the middle course at theapparent instance of a person within began to make for theleft hand pavement and so at last under further instructions floundered to a full stop before the prince s windows the personwithin alighting with an easier motion proved to be a lady wholeft the vehicle to wait and putting up no umbrella quicklycrossed the wet interval that separated her from the house shebut flitted and disappeared yet the prince from his standpoint had had time to recognise her and the recognition kept him forsome minutes motionless charlotte stant at such an hour in a shabby four wheeler and awaterproof charlotte stant turning up for him at the very climaxof his special inner vision was an apparition charged with acongruity at which he stared almost as if it had been a violence the effect of her coming to see him him only had while hestood waiting a singular intensity though after some minuteshad passed the certainty of this began to drop perhaps she hadnot come or had come only for maggie perhaps on learning belowthat the princess had not returned she was merely leaving amessage writing a word on a card he should see at any rate and meanwhile controlling himself would do nothing thisthought of not interfering took on a sudden force for him shewould doubtless hear he was at home but he would let her visitto him be all of her own choosing and his view of a reason forleaving her free was the more remarkable that though taking nostep he yet intensely hoped the harmony of her breaking intosight while the superficial conditions were so against her was aharmony with conditions that were far from superficial and thatgave for his imagination an extraordinary value to herpresence the value deepened strangely moreover with the rigourof his own attitude with the fact too that listening hard heneither heard the house door close again nor saw her go back toher cab and it had risen to a climax by the time he had becomeaware with his quickened sense that she had followed the butlerup to the landing from which his room opened if anything couldfurther then have added to it the renewed pause outside as ifshe had said to the man wait a moment would have constitutedthis touch yet when the man had shown her in had advanced tothe tea table to light the lamp under the kettle and had thenbusied himself all deliberately with the fire she made it easyfor her host to drop straight from any height of tension and tomeet her provisionally on the question of maggie while thebutler remained it was maggie that she had come to see and maggiethat in spite of this attendant s high blankness on the subjectof all possibilities on that lady s part she would cheerfully by the fire wait for as soon as they were alone together however she mounted as with the whizz and the red light of arocket from the form to the fact saying straight out as shestood and looked at him what else my dear what in the worldelse can we do it was as if he then knew on the spot why he had been feeling for hours as he had felt as if he in fact knew within theminute things he had not known even while she was panting asfrom the effect of the staircase at the door of the room heknew at the same time none the less that she knew still morethan he in the sense that is of all the signs and portentsthat might count for them and his vision of alternative shecould scarce say what to call them solutions satisfactions opened out altogether with this tangible truth of her attitudeby the chimney place the way she looked at him as through thegained advantage of it her right hand resting on the marble andher left keeping her skirt from the fire while she held out afoot to dry he couldn t have told what particular links and gapshad at the end of a few minutes found themselves renewed andbridged for he remembered no occasion in rome from which thepicture could have been so exactly copied he remembered thatis none of her coming to see him in the rain while a muddyfour wheeler waited and while though having left her waterproofdownstairs she was yet invested with the odd eloquence thepositive picturesqueness yes given all the rest of the matter of a dull dress and a black bowdlerised hat that seemed to make apoint of insisting on their time of life and their moralintention the hat s and the frock s own as well as on the ironyof indifference to them practically playing in her so handsomerain freshened face the sense of the past revived for himnevertheless as it had not yet done it made that other timesomehow meet the future close interlocking with it before hiswatching eyes as in a long embrace of arms and lips and sohandling and hustling the present that this poor quantity scarceretained substance enough scarce remained sufficiently there tobe wounded or shocked what had happened in short was that charlotte and he had by asingle turn of the wrist of fate led up to indeed no doubt by steps and stages that conscious computation had missed beenplaced face to face in a freedom that partook extraordinarily of ideal perfection since the magic web had spun itself withouttheir toil almost without their touch above all on thisoccasion once more there sounded through their safety as anundertone the very voice he had listened to on the eve of hismarriage with such another sort of unrest dimly again andagain from that period on he had seemed to hear it tell him whyit kept recurring but it phrased the large music now in a waythat filled the room the reason was into which he had lived quite intimately by the end of a quarter of an hour that justthis truth of their safety offered it now a kind of unexampledreceptacle letting it spread and spread but at the same timeelastically enclosing it banking it in for softness as withbillows of eiderdown on that morning in the park there hadbeen however dissimulated doubt and danger whereas the talethis afternoon was taken up with a highly emphasised confidence the emphasis for their general comfort was what charlotte hadcome to apply inasmuch as though it was not what she definitelybegan with it had soon irrepressibly shaped itself it was themeaning of the question she had put to him as soon as they werealone even though indeed as from not quite understanding hehad not then directly replied it was the meaning of everythingelse down to the conscious quaintness of her ricketty growler and the conscious humility of her dress it had helped him alittle the question of these eccentricities to let herimmediate appeal pass without an answer he could ask her insteadwhat had become of her carriage and why above all she was notusing it in such weather it s just because of the weather she explained it s mylittle idea it makes me feel as i used to when i could do as iliked xviiithis came out so straight that he saw at once how much truth itexpressed yet it was truth that still a little puzzled him butdid you ever like knocking about in such discomfort it seems to me now that i then liked everything it s the charm at any rate she said from her place at the fire of tryingagain the old feelings they come back they come back everything she went on comes back besides she wound up you know for yourself he stood near her his hands in his pockets but not looking ather looking hard at the tea table ah i haven t your courage moreover he laughed it seems to me that so far as that goes i do live in hansoms but you must awfully want your tea hequickly added so let me give you a good stiff cup he busied himself with this care and she sat down on hispushing up a low seat where she had been standing so that while she talked he could bring her what she further desired hemoved to and fro before her he helped himself and her visit asthe moments passed had more and more the effect of a signalcommunication that she had come all responsibly anddeliberately as on the clear show of the clock face of theirsituation to make the whole demonstration none the less presented itself as taking place at a very high level of debate in the cool upper air of the finer discrimination the deepersincerity the larger philosophy no matter what were the factsinvoked and arrayed it was only a question as yet of theirseeing their way together to which indeed exactly the presentoccasion appeared to have so much to contribute it s not thatyou haven t my courage charlotte said but that you haven t irather think my imagination unless indeed it should turn outafter all she added that you haven t even my intelligence however i shall not be afraid of that till you ve given me moreproof and she made again but more clearly her point of amoment before you knew besides you knew to day i would come and if you knew that you know everything so she pursued and ifhe didn t meanwhile if he didn t even at this take her up itmight be that she was so positively fitting him again with thefair face of temporising kindness that he had given her to keepher eyes on at the other important juncture and the sense ofwhich she might ever since have been carrying about with her likea precious medal not exactly blessed by the pope suspended roundher neck she had come back however this might be to herimmediate account of herself and no mention of their greatprevious passage was to rise to the lips of either above all she said there has been the personal romance of it of tea with me over the fire ah so far as that goes i don tthink even my intelligence fails me oh it s further than that goes and if i ve had a better daythan you it s perhaps when i come to think of it that i ambraver you bore yourself you see but i don t i don t idon t she repeated it s precisely boring one s self without relief he protested that takes courage passive then not active my romance is that if you want toknow i ve been all day on the town literally on the town isn tthat what they call it i know how it feels after which as ifbreaking off and you have you never been out she asked he still stood there with his hands in his pockets what shouldi have gone out for oh what should people in our case do anything for but you rewonderful all of you you know how to live we re clumsy brutes we other s beside you we must always be doing something however charlotte pursued if you had gone out you might havemissed the chance of me which i m sure though you won t confessit was what you didn t want and might have missed above all the satisfaction that look blank about it as you will i ve cometo congratulate you on that s really what i can at last do youcan t not know at least on such a day as this you can t notknow she said where you are she waited as for him either togrant that he knew or to pretend that he didn t but he only drewa long deep breath which came out like a moan of impatience itbrushed aside the question of where he was or what he knew itseemed to keep the ground clear for the question of his visitorherself that of charlotte verver exactly as she sat there so for some moments with their long look they but treated thematter in silence with the effect indeed by the end of thetime of having considerably brought it on this was sufficientlymarked in what charlotte next said there it all is extraordinary beyond words it makes such a relation for us as iverily believe was never before in the world thrust upon twowell meaning creatures haven t we therefore to take things as wefind them she put the question still more directly than that ofa moment before but to this one as well he returned noimmediate answer noticing only that she had finished her tea herelieved her of her cup carried it back to the table asked herwhat more she would have and then on her nothing thanks returned to the fire and restored a displaced log to position bya small but almost too effectual kick she had meanwhile got upagain and it was on her feet that she repeated the words she hadfirst frankly spoken what else can we do what in all the worldelse he took them up however no more than at first where then haveyou been he asked as from mere interest in her adventure everywhere i could think of except to see people i didn t wantpeople i wanted too much to think but i ve been back atintervals three times and then come away again my cabman mustthink me crazy it s very amusing i shall owe him when we cometo settle more money than he has ever seen i ve been my dear she went on to the british museum which you know i alwaysadore and i ve been to the national gallery and to a dozen oldbooksellers coming across treasures and i ve lunched on somestrange nastiness at a cookshop in holborn i wanted to go tothe tower but it was too far my old man urged that and i wouldhave gone to the zoo if it hadn t been too wet which he alsobegged me to observe but you wouldn t believe i did put in st paul s such days she wound up are expensive for besidesthe cab i ve bought quantities of books she immediatelypassed at any rate to another point i can t help wonderingwhen you must last have laid eyes on them and then as it hadapparently for her companion an effect of abruptness maggie imean and the child for i suppose you know he s with her oh yes i know he s with her i saw them this morning and did they then announce their programme she told me she was taking him as usual da nonno and for the whole day he hesitated but it was as if his attitude had slowly shifted she didn t say and i didn t ask well she went on it can t have been later than half pastten i mean when you saw them they had got to eaton squarebefore eleven you know we don t formally breakfast adam and i we have tea in our rooms at least i have but luncheon is early and i saw my husband this morning by twelve he was showing thechild a picture book maggie had been there with them had leftthem settled together then she had gone out taking the carriagefor something he had been intending but that she offered to doinstead the prince appeared to confess at this to his interest taking you mean your carriage i don t know which and it doesn t matter it s not a question she smiled of a carriage the more or the less it s not aquestion even if you come to that of a cab it s so beautiful she said that it s not a question of anything vulgar orhorrid which she gave him time to agree about and though hewas silent it was rather remarkably as if he fell in i wentout i wanted to i had my idea it seemed to me important ithas been it is important i know as i haven t known before theway they feel i couldn t in any other way have made so sure ofit they feel a confidence the prince observed he had indeed said it for her they feel a confidence and sheproceeded with lucidity to the fuller illustration of it speaking again of the three different moments that in the courseof her wild ramble had witnessed her return for curiosity andeven really a little from anxiety to eaton square she waspossessed of a latch key rarely used it had always irritatedadam one of the few things that did to find servants standingup so inhumanly straight when they came home in the small hours after parties so i had but to slip in each time with my cabat the door and make out for myself without their knowing it that maggie was still there i came i went without their somuch as dreaming what do they really suppose she asked becomes of one not so much sentimentally or morally so tocall it and since that doesn t matter but even just physically materially as a mere wandering woman as a decent harmless wife after all as the best stepmother after all that really everwas or at the least simply as a maitresse de maison not quitewithout a conscience they must even in their odd way shedeclared have some idea oh they ve a great deal of idea said the prince and nothingwas easier than to mention the quantity they think so much ofus they think in particular so much of you ah don t put it all on me she smiled but he was putting it now where she had admirably prepared theplace it s a matter of your known character ah thank you for known she still smiled it s a matter of your wonderful cleverness and wonderful charm it s a matter of what those things have done for you in theworld i mean in this world and this place you re a personagefor them and personages do go and come oh no my dear there you re quite wrong and she laughed nowin the happier light they had diffused that s exactly whatpersonages don t do they live in state and under constantconsideration they haven t latch keys but drums and trumpetsannounce them and when they go out in growlers it makes agreater noise still it s you caro mio she said who so faras that goes are the personage ah he in turn protested don t put it all on me what at anyrate when you get home he added shall you say that you vebeen doing i shall say beautifully that i ve been here all day yes all day keeping you company in your solitude how can weunderstand anything she went on without really seeing thatthis is what they must like to think i do for you just as quite as comfortably you do it for me the thing is for us tolearn to take them as they are he considered this a while in his restless way but with hiseyes not turning from her after which rather disconnectedly though very vehemently he brought out how can i not feel morethan anything else how they adore together my boy and then further as if slightly disconcerted she had nothing to meetthis and he quickly perceived the effect they would have donethe same for one of yours ah if i could have had one i hoped and i believed saidcharlotte that that would happen it would have been better itwould have made perhaps some difference he thought so too poorduck that it might have been i m sure he hoped and intended so it s not at any rate she went on my fault there it is shehad uttered these statements one by one gravely sadly andresponsibly owing it to her friend to be clear she pausedbriefly but as if once for all she made her clearnesscomplete and now i m too sure it will never be he waited for a moment never never they treated the matter not exactly with solemnity butwith a certain decency even perhaps urgency of distinctness it would probably have been better charlotte added butthings turn out and it leaves us she made the point morealone he seemed to wonder it leaves you more alone oh she again returned don t put it all on me maggie wouldhave given herself to his child i m sure scarcely less than hegives himself to yours it would have taken more than any childof mine she explained it would have taken more than tenchildren of mine could i have had them to keep our sposiapart she smiled as for the breadth of the image but as heseemed to take it in spite of this for important she thenspoke gravely enough it s as strange as you like but we reimmensely alone he kept vaguely moving but there were momentswhen again with an awkward ease and his hands in his pockets he was more directly before her he stood there at these lastwords which had the effect of making him for a little throw backhis head and as thinking something out stare up at the ceiling what will you say she meanwhile asked that you ve beendoing this brought his consciousness and his eyes back to her and she pointed her question i mean when she comes in for isuppose she will some time come in it seems to me we must saythe same thing well he thought again yet i can scarce pretend to have hadwhat i haven t ah what haven t you had what aren t you having her question rang out as they lingered face to face and he stilltook it before he answered from her eyes we must at leastthen not to be absurd together do the same thing we must act it would really seem in concert it would really seem her eyebrows her shoulders went up quite in gaiety as for the relief this brought her it s all inthe world i pretend we must act in concert heaven knows shesaid they do so it was that he evidently saw and that by his admission thecase could fairly be put but what he evidently saw appeared tocome over him at the same time as too much for him so that hefell back suddenly to ground where she was not awaiting him thedifficulty is and will always be that i don t understand them i didn t at first but i thought i should learn to that was whati hoped and it appeared then that fanny assingham might helpme oh fanny assingham said charlotte verver he stared a moment at her tone she would do anything for us to which charlotte at first said nothing as if from the sense oftoo much then indulgently enough she shook her head we rebeyond her he thought a moment as of where this placed them she d doanything then for them well so would we so that doesn t help us she has broken down she doesn t understand us and really my dear charlotte added fanny assingham doesn t matter he wondered again unless as taking care of them ah charlotte instantly said isn t it for us only to dothat she spoke as with a flare of pride for their privilege andtheir duty i think we want no one s aid she spoke indeed with a nobleness not the less effective forcoming in so oddly with a sincerity visible even through thecomplicated twist by which any effort to protect the father andthe daughter seemed necessarily conditioned for them it movedhim in any case as if some spring of his own a weaker one hadsuddenly been broken by it these things all the while theprivilege the duty the opportunity had been the substance ofhis own vision they formed the note he had been keeping back toshow her that he was not in their so special situation withouta responsible view a conception that he could name and couldact on was something that now at last not to be too eminent afool he was required by all the graces to produce and theluminous idea she had herself uttered would have been hisexpression of it she had anticipated him but as her expressionleft for positive beauty nothing to be desired he felt ratherrighted than wronged a large response as he looked at her cameinto his face a light of excited perception all his own in theglory of which as it almost might be called what he gave herback had the value of what she had given him they reextraordinarily happy oh charlotte s measure of it was only too full beatifically that s the great thing he went on so that it doesn t matter really that one doesn t understand besides you do enough i understand my husband perhaps she after an instant conceded i don t understand your wife you re of the same race at any rate more or less of the samegeneral tradition and education of the same moral paste thereare things you have in common with them but i on my side asi ve gone on trying to see if i haven t some of these thingstoo i on my side have more and more failed there seem at lastto be none worth mentioning i can t help seeing it i mdecidedly too different yet you re not charlotte made the important point toodifferent from me i don t know as we re not married that brings things out perhaps if we were he said you would find some abyss ofdivergence since it depends on that then she smiled i m safe as youare anyhow moreover as one has so often had occasion to feel and even to remark they re very very simple that makes sheadded a difficulty for belief but when once one has taken itin it makes less difficulty for action i have at last formyself i think taken it in i m not afraid he wondered a moment not afraid of what well generally of some beastly mistake especially of anymistake founded on one s idea of their difference for thatidea charlotte developed positively makes one so tender ah but rather well then there it is i can t put myself into maggie s skin ican t as i say it s not my fit i shouldn t be able as i seeit to breathe in it but i can feel that i d do anything toshield it from a bruise tender as i am for her too she wenton i think i m still more so for my husband he s in truth of asweet simplicity the prince turned over a while the sweet simplicity of mr verver well i don t know that i can choose at night all catsare grey i only see how for so many reasons we ought to standtoward them and how to do ourselves justice we do itrepresents for us a conscious care of every hour literally said charlotte she could rise to thehighest measure of the facts and for which we must trust eachother oh as we trust the saints in glory fortunately the princehastened to add we can with which as for the full assuranceand the pledge it involved their hands instinctively found theirhands it s all too wonderful firmly and gravely she kept his hand it s too beautiful and so for a minute they stood together as strongly held and asclosely confronted as any hour of their easier past even had seenthem they were silent at first only facing and faced onlygrasping and grasped only meeting and met it s sacred hesaid at last it s sacred she breathed back to him they vowed it gave itout and took it in drawn by their intensity more closelytogether then of a sudden through this tightened circle as atthe issue of a narrow strait into the sea beyond everythingbroke up broke down gave way melted and mingled their lipssought their lips their pressure their response and theirresponse their pressure with a violence that had sighed itselfthe next moment to the longest and deepest of stillnesses theypassionately sealed their pledge xixhe had taken it from her as we have seen moreover that fannyassingham didn t now matter the now he had even himselfsupplied as no more than fair to his sense of various earlierstages and though his assent remained scarce more than tacit his behaviour for the hour so fell into line that for manydays he kept postponing the visit he had promised his old friendon the occasion of their talk at the foreign office with regret none the less would he have seen it quite extinguished thattheory of their relation as attached pupil and kind instructressin which they had from the first almost equally found aconvenience it had been he no doubt who had most put itforward since his need of knowledge fairly exceeded her mildpretension but he had again and again repeated to her that heshould never without her have been where he was and she hadnot successfully concealed the pleasure it might give her tobelieve it even after the question of where he was had begun toshow itself as rather more closed than open to interpretation ithad never indeed before that evening come up as during thepassage at the official party and he had for the first time atthose moments a little disappointedly got the impression of acertain failure on the dear woman s part of something he wasaware of having always rather freely taken for granted in her ofwhat exactly the failure consisted he would still perhaps havefelt it a little harsh to try to say and if she had in fact asby charlotte s observation broken down the details of thecollapse would be comparatively unimportant they came to thesame thing all such collapses the failure of courage thefailure of friendship or the failure just simply of tact fordidn t any one of them by itself amount really to the failure ofwit which was the last thing he had expected of her and whichwould be but another name for the triumph of stupidity it hadbeen charlotte s remark that they were at last beyond her whereas he had ever enjoyed believing that a certain easyimagination in her would keep up with him to the end he shrankfrom affixing a label to mrs assingham s want of faith but whenhe thought at his ease of the way persons who were capablereally entertained or at least with any refinement the passionof personal loyalty he figured for them a play of fancy neithertimorous nor scrupulous so would his personal loyalty if needbe have accepted the adventure for the good creature herself tothat definite degree that he had positively almost missed theluxury of some such call from her that was what it all came backto again with these people among whom he was married that onefound one used one s imagination mainly for wondering how theycontrived so little to appeal to it he felt at moments as ifthere were never anything to do for them that was worthy to callworthy of the personal relation never any charming charge totake of any confidence deeply reposed he might vulgarly have putit that one had never to plot or to lie for them he mighthumourously have put it that one had never as by the higherconformity to lie in wait with the dagger or to prepare insidiously the cup these were the services that by allromantic tradition were consecrated to affection quite as muchas to hate but he could amuse himself with saying so far as theamusement went that they were what he had once for all turnedhis back on fanny was meanwhile frequent it appeared in eaton square somuch he gathered from the visitor who was not infrequent leastof all at tea time during the same period in portland place though they had little need to talk of her after practicallyagreeing that they had outlived her to the scene of theseconversations and suppressions mrs assingham herself made actually no approach her latest view of her utility seeming tobe that it had found in eaton square its most urgent field itwas finding there in fact everything and everyone but the prince who mostly just now kept away or who at all events on theinterspaced occasions of his calling happened not to encounterthe only person from whom he was a little estranged it wouldhave been all prodigious if he had not already with charlotte said so very considerably lived into it it would have been allindescribably remarkable this fact that with wonderful causesfor it so operating on the surface nobody else as yet in thecombination seemed estranged from anybody if mrs assinghamdelighted in maggie she knew by this time how most easily toreach her and if she was unhappy about charlotte she knew bythe same reasoning how most probably to miss that vision of heron which affliction would feed it might feed of course onfinding her so absent from her home just as this particularphenomenon of her domestic detachment could be by the anxiousmind best studied there fanny was however for her reasons shy of portland place itself this was appreciable so that shemight well after all have no great light on the question ofwhether charlotte s appearances there were frequent or not anymore than on that of the account they might be keeping of theusual solitude since it came to this of the head of that house there was always to cover all ambiguities to constitute a fundof explanation for the divisions of mrs verver s day thecircumstance that at the point they had all reached together mrs verver was definitely and by general acclamation in chargeof the social relations of the family literally of those ofthe two households as to her genius for representing which inthe great world and in the grand style vivid evidence had moreand more accumulated it had been established in the twohouseholds at an early stage and with the highest good humour that charlotte was a was the social success whereas theprincess though kind though punctilious though charming though in fact the dearest little creature in the world and theprincess into the bargain was distinctly not would distinctlynever be and might as well practically give it up whetherthrough being above it or below it too much outside of it or toomuch lost in it too unequipped or too indisposed didn tespecially matter what sufficed was that the whole thing callit appetite or call it patience the act of representation atlarge and the daily business of intercourse fell in withcharlotte s tested facility and not much less visibly with heraccommodating her generous view of her domestic use she hadcome frankly into the connection to do and to be what shecould no questions asked and she had taken over accordingly as it stood and in the finest practical spirit the burden of avisiting list that maggie originally left to herself and lefteven more to the principino had suffered to get inordinately outof hand she had in a word not only mounted cheerfully the londontreadmill she had handsomely professed herself for the furthercomfort of the three others sustained in the effort by a frivolous side if that were not too harsh a name for apleasant constitutional curiosity there were possibilities ofdulness ponderosities of practice arid social sands the badquarters of an hour that turned up like false pieces in a debasedcurrency of which she made on principle very nearly as lightas if she had not been clever enough to distinguish the princehad on this score paid her his compliment soon after her returnfrom her wedding tour in america where by all accounts she hadwondrously borne the brunt facing brightly at her husband sside everything that came up and what had come often wasbeyond words just as precisely with her own interest only atstake she had thrown up the game during the visit paid beforeher marriage the discussion of the american world thecomparison of notes impressions and adventures had been all athand as a ground of meeting for mrs verver and her husband sson in law from the hour of the reunion of the two couples thusit had been in short that charlotte could for her friend sappreciation so promptly make her point even using expressionsfrom which he let her see at the hour that he drew amusement ofhis own what could be more simple than one s going through witheverything she had asked when it s so plain a part of one scontract i ve got so much by my marriage for she had neverfor a moment concealed from him how much she had felt it andwas finding it that i should deserve no charity if i stinted myreturn not to do that to give back on the contrary all one can are just one s decency and one s honour and one s virtue thesethings henceforth if you re interested to know are my rule oflife the absolute little gods of my worship the holy images setup on the wall oh yes since i m not a brute she had wound up you shall see me as i am which was therefore as he had seenher dealing always from month to month from day to day andfrom one occasion to the other with the duties of a remuneratedoffice her perfect her brilliant efficiency had doubtless allthe while contributed immensely to the pleasant ease in whichher husband and her husband s daughter were lapped it had infact probably done something more than this it had given them afiner and sweeter view of the possible scope of that ease theyhad brought her in on the crudest expression of it to do the worldly for them and she had done it with such genius thatthey had themselves in consequence renounced it even more thanthey had originally intended in proportion as she did it moreover was she to be relieved of other and humbler doings which minor matters by the properest logic devolved thereforeupon maggie in whose chords and whose province they morenaturally lay not less naturally by the same token theyincluded the repair at the hands of the latter young woman ofevery stitch conceivably dropped by charlotte in eaton square this was homely work but that was just what made it maggie s bearing in mind dear amerigo who was so much of her own greatmundane feather and whom the homeliness in question didn t nodoubt quite equally provide for that would be to balance justin a manner charlotte s very most charming function from themoment charlotte could be got adequately to recognise it well that charlotte might be appraised as at last notineffectually recognising it was a reflection that during thedays with which we are actually engaged completed in theprince s breast these others these images and ruminations of hisleisure these gropings and fittings of his conscience and hisexperience that we have attempted to set in order there theybore him company not insufficiently considering in especial his fuller resources in that line while he worked out to thelast lucidity the principle on which he forbore either to seekfanny out in cadogan place or to perpetrate the error of toomarked an assiduity in eaton square this error would be his notavailing himself to the utmost of the convenience of any artlesstheory of his constitution or of charlotte s that might prevailthere that artless theories could and did prevail was a fact hehad ended by accepting under copious evidence as definite andultimate and it consorted with common prudence with thesimplest economy of life not to be wasteful of any odd gleaning to haunt eaton square in fine would be to show that he had not like his brilliant associate a sufficiency of work in the world it was just his having that sufficiency it was just their havingit together that so strangely and so blessedly made as theyput it to each other everything possible what further proppedup the case moreover was that the world by still anotherbeautiful perversity of their chance included portland placewithout including to anything like the same extent eaton square the latter residence at the same time it must promptly beadded did on occasion wake up to opportunity and as givingitself a frolic shake send out a score of invitations one ofwhich fitful flights precisely had before easter the effectof disturbing a little our young man s measure of his margin maggie with a proper spirit held that her father ought fromtime to time to give a really considered dinner and mr verver who had as little idea as ever of not meeting expectation was ofthe harmonious opinion that his wife ought charlotte s ownjudgment was always that they were ideally free the proof ofwhich would always be she maintained that everyone they fearedthey might most have alienated by neglect would arrive wreathedwith smiles on the merest hint of a belated signal wreathed insmiles all round truly enough these apologetic banquets struckamerigo as being they were frankly touching occasions to him marked in the great london bousculade with a small still graceof their own an investing amenity and humanity everybody came everybody rushed but all succumbed to the soft influence andthe brutality of mere multitude of curiosity without tenderness was put off at the foot of the fine staircase with theovercoats and shawls the entertainment offered a few eveningsbefore easter and at which maggie and he were inevitably presentas guests was a discharge of obligations not insistentlyincurred and had thereby possibly all the more the note ofthis almost arcadian optimism a large bright dull murmurous mild eyed middle aged dinner involving for the most part verybland though very exalted immensely announceable andhierarchically placeable couples and followed without theoppression of a later contingent by a brief instrumentalconcert over the preparation of which the prince knew maggie sanxiety had conferred with charlotte s ingenuity and both hadsupremely revelled as it were in mr verver s solvency the assinghams were there by prescription though quite at thefoot of the social ladder and with the colonel s wife in spiteof her humility of position the prince was more inwardlyoccupied than with any other person except charlotte he wasoccupied with charlotte because in the first place she lookedso inordinately handsome and held so high where so much else wasmature and sedate the torch of responsive youth and the standardof passive grace and because of the fact that in the second the occasion so far as it referred itself with any confidence ofemphasis to a hostess seemed to refer itself preferentially well meaningly and perversely to maggie it was notindistinguishable to him when once they were all stationed thathis wife too had in perfection her own little character but hewondered how it managed so visibly to simplify itself and this he knew in spite of any desire she entertained to the essentialair of having overmuch on her mind the felicity and indeed thevery conduct and credit of the feast he knew as well theother things of which her appearance was at any time and ineaton square especially made up her resemblance to her father at times so vivid and coming out in the delicate warmth ofoccasions like the quickened fragrance of a flower herresemblance as he had hit it off for her once in rome in thefirst flushed days after their engagement to a littledancing girl at rest ever so light of movement but most oftenpanting gently even a shade compunctiously on a bench herapproximation finally for it was analogy somehow more thanidentity to the transmitted images of rather neutral andnegative propriety that made up in his long line the average ofwifehood and motherhood if the roman matron had been insufficiency first and last the honour of that line maggiewould no doubt at fifty have expanded have solidified to somesuch dignity even should she suggest a little but a cornelia inminiature a light however broke for him in season and whenonce it had done so it made him more than ever aware of mrs verver s vaguely yet quite exquisitely contingentparticipation a mere hinted or tendered discretion in short ofmrs verver s indescribable unfathomable relation to the scene her placed condition her natural seat and neighbourhood herintenser presence her quieter smile her fewer jewels wereinevitably all as nothing compared with the preoccupation thatburned in maggie like a small flame and that had in fact kindledin each of her cheeks a little attesting but fortunately by nomeans unbecoming spot the party was her father s party and itsgreater or smaller success was a question having for her all theimportance of his importance so that sympathy created for her asort of visible suspense under pressure of which she bristledwith filial reference with little filial recalls of expression movement tone it was all unmistakable and as pretty aspossible if one would and even as funny but it put the pair sotogether as undivided by the marriage of each that the princessil n y avait pas a dire might sit where she liked she wouldstill always in that house be irremediably maggie verver theprince found himself on this occasion so beset with thatperception that its natural complement for him would really havebeen to wonder if mr verver had produced on people something ofthe same impression in the recorded cases of his having dinedwith his daughter this backward speculation had it begun to play however wouldhave been easily arrested for it was at present to come overamerigo as never before that his remarkable father in law was theman in the world least equipped with different appearances fordifferent hours he was simple he was a revelation ofsimplicity and that was the end of him so far as he consisted ofan appearance at all a question that might verily for aweakness in it have been argued it amused our young man whowas taking his pleasure to night it will be seen in sundryoccult ways it amused him to feel how everything else the masterof the house consisted of resources possessions facilities andamiabilities amplified by the social legend depended forconveying the effect of quantity on no personal equation nomere measurable medium quantity was in the air for these goodpeople and mr verver s estimable quality was almost wholly inthat pervasion he was meagre and modest and clearbrowed and hiseyes if they wandered without fear yet stayed without defiance his shoulders were not broad his chest was not high hiscomplexion was not fresh and the crown of his head was notcovered in spite of all of which he looked at the top of histable so nearly like a little boy shyly entertaining in virtueof some imposed rank that he could only be one of the powers the representative of a force quite as an infant king is therepresentative of a dynasty in this generalised view of hisfather in law intensified to night but always operative amerigohad now for some time taken refuge the refuge after the reunionof the two households in england had more and more offereditself as the substitute for communities from man to man that by his original calculation might have become possible but thathad not really ripened and flowered he met the decent familyeyes across the table met them afterwards in the music room butonly to read in them still what he had learned to read during hisfirst months the time of over anxious initiation a kind ofapprehension in which the terms and conditions were finally fixedand absolute this directed regard rested at its ease but itneither lingered nor penetrated and was to the prince s fancy much of the same order as any glance directed for due attention from the same quarter to the figure of a cheque received in thecourse of business and about to be enclosed to a banker it madesure of the amount and just so from time to time the amount ofthe prince was made sure he was being thus in renewedinstalments perpetually paid in he already reposed in the bankas a value but subject in this comfortable way to repeated toinfinite endorsement the net result of all of which moreover was that the young man had no wish to see his value diminish hehimself after all had not fixed it the figure was aconception all of mr verver s own certainly however everything must be kept up to it never so much as to night hadthe prince felt this he would have been uncomfortable as thesequiet expressions passed had the case not been guaranteed forhim by the intensity of his accord with charlotte it wasimpossible that he should not now and again meet charlotte seyes as it was also visible that she too now and again met herhusband s for her as well in all his pulses he felt theconveyed impression it put them it kept them together throughthe vain show of their separation made the two other faces madethe whole lapse of the evening the people the lights theflowers the pretended talk the exquisite music a mystic goldenbridge between them strongly swaying and sometimes almostvertiginous for that intimacy of which the sovereign law wouldbe the vigilance of care would be never rashly to forget andnever consciously to wound xxthe main interest of these hours for us however will have beenin the way the prince continued to know during a particularsuccession of others separated from the evening in eaton squareby a short interval a certain persistent aftertaste this wasthe lingering savour of a cup presented to him by fannyassingham s hand after dinner while the clustered quartette kepttheir ranged companions in the music room moved if one would but conveniently motionless mrs assingham contrived after acouple of pieces to convey to her friend that for her part shewas moved by the genius of brahms beyond what she could bear so that without apparent deliberation she had presently floatedaway at the young man s side to such a distance as permittedthem to converse without the effect of disdain it was the twentyminutes enjoyed with her during the rest of the concert in theless associated electric glare of one of the empty rooms it wastheir achieved and as he would have said successful mostpleasantly successful talk on one of the sequestered sofas itwas this that was substantially to underlie his consciousness ofthe later occasion the later occasion then mere matter ofdiscussion had formed her ground for desiring in a lightundertone into which his quick ear read indeed some nervousness these independent words with him she had sounded covertly butdistinctly by the time they were seated together the greatquestion of what it might involve it had come out for him beforeanything else and so abruptly that this almost needed anexplanation then the abruptness itself had appeared to explain which had introduced in turn a slight awkwardness do you knowthat they re not after all going to matcham so that if theydon t if at least maggie doesn t you won t i suppose go byyourself it was as i say at matcham where the event hadplaced him it was at matcham during the easter days that itmost befell him oddly enough to live over inwardly for itswealth of special significance this passage by which the eventhad been really a good deal determined he had paid first andlast many an english country visit he had learned even from ofold to do the english things and to do them all sufficiently in the english way if he didn t always enjoy them madly heenjoyed them at any rate as much to an appearance as the goodpeople who had in the night of time unanimously invented them and who still in the prolonged afternoon of their good faith unanimously even if a trifle automatically practised them yet with it all he had never so much as during such sojourns thetrick of a certain detached the amusement of a certain inwardcritical life the determined need which apparently allparticipant of returning upon itself of backing noiselessly in far in again and rejoining there as it were that part of hismind that was not engaged at the front his body veryconstantly was engaged at the front in shooting in riding ingolfing in walking over the fine diagonals of meadow paths orround the pocketed corners of billiard tables it sufficiently on the whole in fact bore the brunt of bridge playing ofbreakfasting lunching tea drinking dining and of the nightlyclimax over the bottigliera as he called it of the bristlingtray it met finally to the extent of the limited tax on lip on gesture on wit most of the current demands of conversationand expression therefore something of him he often felt atthese times was left out it was much more when he was alone orwhen he was with his own people or when he was say with mrs verver and nobody else that he moved that he talked that helistened that he felt as a congruous whole english society as he would have said cut him accordingly in two and he reminded himself often in his relations with it of a man possessed of a shining star a decoration an order ofsome sort something so ornamental as to make his identity notcomplete ideally without it yet who finding no other suchobject generally worn should be perpetually and the least bitruefully unpinning it from his breast to transfer it to hispocket the prince s shining star may no doubt having beennothing more precious than his private subtlety but whatever theobject was he just now fingered it a good deal out of sight amounting as it mainly did for him to a restless play of memoryand a fine embroidery of thought something had rathermomentously occurred in eaton square during his enjoyed minuteswith his old friend his present perspective made definitelyclear to him that she had plumped out for him her first littlelie that took on and he could scarce have said why a sharpnessof importance she had never lied to him before if only becauseit had never come up for her properly intelligibly morally that she must as soon as she had put to him the question of whathe would do by which she meant of what charlotte would also do in that event of maggie s and mr verver s not embracing theproposal they had appeared for a day or two resignedly toentertain as soon as she had betrayed her curiosity as to theline the other pair so left to themselves might take a desireto avoid the appearance of at all too directly prying had becomemarked in her betrayed by the solicitude of which she had already three weeks before given him a view she had beenobliged on a second thought to name intelligibly a reason forher appeal while the prince on his side had had not withoutmercy his glimpse of her momentarily groping for one and yetremaining unprovided not without mercy because absolutely hehad on the spot in his friendliness invented one for her use presenting it to her with a look no more significant than if hehad picked up to hand back to her a dropped flower you ask ifi m likely also to back out then because it may make adifference in what you and the colonel decide he had gone asfar as that for her fairly inviting her to assent though nothaving had his impression from any indication offered him bycharlotte that the assinghams were really in question for thelarge matcham party the wonderful thing after this was thatthe active couple had in the interval managed to inscribethemselves on the golden roll an exertion of a sort that to doher justice he had never before observed fanny to make thislast passage of the chapter but proved after all with whatsuccess she could work when she would once launched himself at any rate as he had been directed byall the terms of the intercourse between portland place and eatonsquare once steeped at matcham in the enjoyment of a splendidhospitality he found everything for his interpretation for hisconvenience fall easily enough into place and all the more thatmrs verver was at hand to exchange ideas and impressions with the great house was full of people of possible new combinations of the quickened play of possible propinquity and no appearance of course was less to be cultivated than that of his havingsought an opportunity to foregather with his friend at a safedistance from their respective sposi there was a happy boldness at the best in their mingling thus each unaccompanied in thesame sustained sociability just exactly a touch of thateccentricity of associated freedom which sat so lightly on theimagination of the relatives left behind they were exposed asmuch as one would to its being pronounced funny that they should at such a rate go about together though on the other hand this consideration drew relief from the fact that in their highconditions and with the easy tradition the almost inspiringallowances of the house in question no individual line howeverfreely marked was pronounced anything more than funny both ourfriends felt afresh as they had felt before the convenience ofa society so placed that it had only its own sensibility toconsider looking as it did well over the heads of all lowergrowths and that moreover treated its own sensibility quite asthe easiest friendliest most informal and domesticated party tothe general alliance what anyone thought of anyone else aboveall of anyone else with anyone else was a matter incurring inthese lulls so little awkward formulation that hovering judgment the spirit with the scales might perfectly have been imagedthere as some rather snubbed and subdued but quite trained andtactful poor relation of equal of the properest lineage onlyof aspect a little dingy doubtless from too limited a change ofdress for whose tacit and abstemious presence never betrayed bya rattle of her rusty machine a room in the attic and a plate atthe side table were decently usual it was amusing in suchlightness of air that the prince should again present himselfonly to speak for the princess so unfortunately unable again to leave home and that mrs verver should as regularly figure asan embodied a beautifully deprecating apology for her husband who was all geniality and humility among his own treasures butas to whom the legend had grown up that he couldn t bear withthe height of his standards and the tone of the company in theway of sofas and cabinets habitually kept by him the irritationand depression to which promiscuous visiting even at pompoushouses had been found to expose him that was all right thenoted working harmony of the clever son in law and the charmingstepmother so long as the relation was for the effect inquestion maintained at the proper point between sufficiency andexcess what with the noble fairness of the place meanwhile thegenerous mood of the sunny gusty lusty english april allpanting and heaving with impatience or kicking and crying even at moments like some infant hercules who wouldn t be dressed what with these things and the bravery of youth and beauty theinsolence of fortune and appetite so diffused among hisfellow guests that the poor assinghams in their comparativelymarked maturity and their comparatively small splendour were theonly approach to a false note in the concert the stir of the airwas such for going in a degree to one s head that as a merematter of exposure almost grotesque in its flagrancy hissituation resembled some elaborate practical joke carried out athis expense every voice in the great bright house was a call tothe ingenuities and impunities of pleasure every echo was adefiance of difficulty doubt or danger every aspect of thepicture a glowing plea for the immediate and as with plentymore to come was another phase of the spell for a world soconstituted was governed by a spell that of the smile of thegods and the favour of the powers the only handsome the onlygallant in fact the only intelligent acceptance of which was afaith in its guarantees and a high spirit for its chances itsdemand to that the thing came back was above all for courageand good humour and the value of this as a general assurance that is for seeing one through at the worst had not even in theeasiest hours of his old roman life struck the prince soconvincingly his old roman life had had more poetry no doubt but as he looked back upon it now it seemed to hang in the air ofmere iridescent horizons to have been loose and vague and thin with large languorous unaccountable blanks the present order asit spread about him had somehow the ground under its feet and atrumpet in its ears and a bottomless bag of solid shiningbritish sovereigns which was much to the point in its hand courage and good humour therefore were the breath of the day though for ourselves at least it would have been also much to thepoint that with amerigo really the innermost effect of allthis perceptive ease was perhaps a strange final irritation hecompared the lucid result with the extraordinary substitute forperception that presided in the bosom of his wife at socontented a view of his conduct and course a state of mind thatwas positively like a vicarious good conscience cultivatedingeniously on his behalf a perversity of pressure innocentlypersisted in and this wonder of irony became on occasion toointense to be kept wholly to himself it wasn t that at matcham anything particular anything monstrous anything that had to benoticed permitted itself as they said to happen there wereonly odd moments when the breath of the day as it has beencalled struck him so full in the face that he broke out with allthe hilarity of what indeed would they have made of it they were of course maggie and her father moping so far as they everconsented to mope in monotonous eaton square but placid too inthe belief that they knew beautifully what their expertcompanions were in for they knew it might have appeared inthese lights absolutely nothing on earth worth speaking of whether beautifully or cynically and they would perhapssometimes be a little less trying if they would only once for allpeacefully admit that knowledge wasn t one of their needs andthat they were in fact constitutionally inaccessible to it theywere good children bless their hearts and the children of goodchildren so that verily the principino himself as lessconsistently of that descent might figure to the fancy as theripest genius of the trio the difficulty was for the nerves of daily intercourse withmaggie in particular that her imagination was clearly neverruffled by the sense of any anomaly the great anomaly would havebeen that her husband or even that her father s wife shouldprove to have been made for the long run after the pattern setfrom so far back to the ververs if one was so made one hadcertainly no business on any terms at matcham whereas if onewasn t one had no business there on the particular terms termsof conformity with the principles of eaton square under whichone had been so absurdly dedicated deep at the heart of thatresurgent unrest in our young man which we have had to contentourselves with calling his irritation deep in the bosom of thisfalsity of position glowed the red spark of his inextinguishablesense of a higher and braver propriety there were situationsthat were ridiculous but that one couldn t yet help as forinstance when one s wife chose in the most usual way to makeone so precisely here however was the difference it had takenpoor maggie to invent a way so extremely unusual yet to which none the less it would be too absurd that he should merely lendhimself being thrust systematically with another woman and awoman one happened by the same token exceedingly to like andbeing so thrust that the theory of it seemed to publish one asidiotic or incapable this was a predicament of which the dignitydepended all on one s own handling what was supremely grotesque in fact was the essential opposition of theories as if agalantuomo as he at least constitutionally conceivedgalantuomini could do anything but blush to go about at such arate with such a person as mrs verver in a state of childlikeinnocence the state of our primitive parents before the fall the grotesque theory as he would have called it was perhaps anodd one to resent with violence and he did it also as a man ofthe world all merciful justice but assuredly none the less there was but one way really to mark and for his companion asmuch as for himself the commiseration in which they held it adequate comment on it could only be private but it could alsoat least be active and of rich and effectual comment charlotteand he were fortunately alike capable wasn t this consensusliterally their only way not to be ungracious it was positivelyas if the measure of their escape from that danger were given bythe growth between them during their auspicious visit of anexquisite sense of complicity xxihe found himself therefore saying with gaiety even to fannyassingham for their common concerned glance at eaton square the glance that was so markedly never as it might have been aglance at portland place what would our cari sposi have made ofit here what would they you know really which overflowwould have been reckless if already and surprisingly perhapseven to himself he had not got used to thinking of this friendas a person in whom the element of protest had of late beenunmistakably allayed he exposed himself of course to herreplying ah if it would have been so bad for them how can itbe so good for you but quite apart from the small sense thequestion would have had at the best she appeared already tounite with him in confidence and cheer he had his view aswell or at least a partial one of the inner spring of thispresent comparative humility which was all consistent with theretraction he had practically seen her make after mr verver slast dinner without diplomatising to do so with no effort tosquare her none to bribe her to an attitude for which he wouldhave had no use in her if it were not sincere he yet felt how heboth held her and moved her by the felicity of his taking pity all instinctively on her just discernible depression by just somuch as he guessed that she felt herself as the slang was outof it out of the crystal current and the expensive picture byjust so much had his friendship charmingly made up to her fromhour to hour for the penalties as they might have been grosslycalled of her mistake her mistake had only been after all inher wanting to seem to him straight she had let herself in forbeing as she had made haste for that matter during the veryfirst half hour at tea to proclaim herself the sole and singlefrump of the party the scale of everything was so different thatall her minor values her quainter graces her little localauthority her humour and her wardrobe alike for which it wasenough elsewhere among her bons amis that they were hers dearfanny assingham s these matters and others would be all now asnought five minutes had sufficed to give her the fatal pitch incadogan place she could always at the worst be picturesque forshe habitually spoke of herself as local to sloane streetwhereas at matcham she should never be anything but horrible andit all would have come the disaster from the real refinement in her of the spirit of friendship to prove to him that shewasn t really watching him ground for which would have been tooterribly grave she had followed him in his pursuit of pleasure so she might precisely mark her detachment this was handsometrouble for her to take the prince could see it all it wasn t ashade of interference that a good natured man would visit on her so he didn t even say when she told him how frumpy she knewherself how frumpy her very maid odiously going back on her rubbed it into her night and morning with unsealed eyes andlips that she now knew her he didn t then say ah see whatyou ve done isn t it rather your own fault he behaveddifferently altogether eminently distinguished himself for shetold him she had never seen him so universally distinguished heyet distinguished her in her obscurity or in what was worse herobjective absurdity and frankly invested her with her absolutevalue surrounded her with all the importance of her wit thatwit as discriminated from stature and complexion a sense for bridge and a credit for pearls could have importance wasmeanwhile but dimly perceived at matcham so that his niceness to her she called it only niceness but it brought tears intoher eyes had the greatness of a general as well as of a specialdemonstration she understands he said as a comment on all this to mrs verver she understands all she needs to understand she hastaken her time but she has at last made it out for herself shesees how all we can desire is to give them the life they prefer to surround them with the peace and quiet and above all with thesense of security most favourable to it she can t of coursevery well put it to us that we have so far as she is concerned but to make the best of our circumstances she can t say in somany words don t think of me for i too must make the best ofmine arrange as you can only and live as you must i don tget quite that from her any more than i ask for it but her toneand her whole manner mean nothing at all unless they mean thatshe trusts us to take as watchful to take as artful to take astender care in our way as she so anxiously takes in hers sothat she s well the prince wound up what you may callpractically all right charlotte in fact however to help outhis confidence didn t call it anything return as he might tothe lucidity the importance or whatever it was of this lesson she gave him no aid toward reading it aloud she let him two orthree times over spell it out for himself only on the eve oftheir visit s end was she for once clear or direct in response they had found a minute together in the great hall of the houseduring the half hour before dinner this easiest of chances theyhad already a couple of times arrived at by waitingpersistently till the last other loiterers had gone to dress andby being prepared themselves to dress so expeditiously that theymight a little later on be among the first to appear in festalarray the hall then was empty before the army of rearranging cushion patting housemaids were marshalled in and there was aplace by the forsaken fire at one end where they might imitate with art the unpremeditated above all here for the snatchedinstants they could breathe so near to each other that theinterval was almost engulfed in it and the intensity both of theunion and the caution became a workable substitute for contact they had prolongations of instants that counted as visions ofbliss they had slow approximations that counted as longcaresses the quality of these passages in truth made thespoken word and especially the spoken word about other people fall below them so that our young woman s tone had even now acertain dryness it s very good of her my dear to trust us but what else can she do why whatever people do when they don t trust let one see theydon t but let whom see well let me say to begin with and should you mind that he had a slight show of surprise shouldn t you her letting you see no said charlotte the only thing i canimagine myself minding is what you yourself if you don t lookout may let her see to which she added you may let her see you know that you re afraid i m only afraid of you a little at moments he presentlyreturned but i shan t let fanny see that it was clear however that neither the limits nor the extent ofmrs assingham s vision were now a real concern to her and shegave expression to this as she had not even yet done what inthe world can she do against us there s not a word that she canbreathe she s helpless she can t speak she would be herselfthe first to be dished by it and then as he seemed slow tofollow it all comes back to her it all began with her everything from the first she introduced you to maggie shemade your marriage the prince might have had his moment of demur but at this aftera little as with a smile dim but deep he came on mayn t shealso be said a good deal to have made yours that was intended i think wasn t it for a kind of rectification charlotte on her side for an instant hesitated then she wasprompter still i don t mean there was anything to rectify everything was as it had to be and i m not speaking of how shemay have been concerned for you and me i m speaking of how shetook in her way each time their lives in hand and how therefore that ties her up to day she can t go to them and say it s very awkward of course you poor dear things but i wasfrivolously mistaken he took it in still with his long look at her all the morethat she wasn t she was right everything s right he went on and everything will stay so then that s all i say but he worked it out for the deeper satisfaction even tosuperfluous lucidity we re happy and they re happy what moredoes the position admit of what more need fanny assingham want ah my dear said charlotte it s not i who say that she needwant anything i only say that she s fixed that she must standexactly where everything has by her own act placed her it syou who have seemed haunted with the possibility for her ofsome injurious alternative something or other we must beprepared for and she had with her high reasoning a strangecold smile we are prepared for anything for everything andas we are practically so she must take us she s condemned toconsistency she s doomed poor thing to a genial optimism that luckily for her however is very much the law of hernature she was born to soothe and to smooth now then therefore mrs verver gently laughed she has the chance ofher life so that her present professions may even at the best not besincere may be but a mask for doubts and fears and for gainingtime the prince had looked with the question as if this again could trouble him and it determined in his companion a slightimpatience you keep talking about such things as if they wereour affair at all i feel at any rate that i ve nothing to dowith her doubts and fears or with anything she may feel shemust arrange all that for herself it s enough for me that she llalways be of necessity much more afraid for herself really either to see or to speak than we should be to have her do iteven if we were the idiots and cowards we aren t andcharlotte s face with these words to the mitigation of theslightly hard ring there might otherwise have been in them fairly lightened softened shone out it reflected as reallynever yet the rare felicity of their luck it made her look forthe moment as if she had actually pronounced that word ofunpermitted presumption so apt is the countenance as with afiner consciousness than the tongue to betray a sense of thisparticular lapse she might indeed the next instant have seenher friend wince in advance at her use of a word that wasalready on her lips for it was still unmistakable with him thatthere were things he could prize forms of fortune he couldcherish without at all proportionately liking their names hadall this however been even completely present to his companion what other term could she have applied to the strongest andsimplest of her ideas but the one that exactly fitted it sheapplied it then though her own instinct moved her at the sametime to pay her tribute to the good taste from which they hadn theretofore by a hair s breadth deviated if it didn t sound sovulgar i should say that we re fatally as it were safe pardonthe low expression since it s what we happen to be we re sobecause they are and they re so because they can t be anythingelse from the moment that having originally intervened forthem she wouldn t now be able to bear herself if she didn t keepthem so that s the way she s inevitably with us said charlotteover her smile we hang essentially together well the prince candidly allowed she did bring it home to him every way it worked out yes i see we hang essentially together his friend had a shrug a shrug that had a grace cosavolete the effect beautifully nobly was more than roman ah beyond doubt it s a case he stood looking at her it s a case there can t he said have been many perhaps never never never any other that she smiled iconfess i should like to think only ours only ours most probably speriamo to which as after hushedconnections he presently added poor fanny but charlotte hadalready with a start and a warning hand turned from a glance atthe clock she sailed away to dress while he watched her reachthe staircase his eyes followed her till with a simple swiftlook round at him she vanished something in the sight however appeared to have renewed the spring of his last exclamation which he breathed again upon the air poor poor fanny it was to prove however on the morrow quite consistent withthe spirit of these words that the party at matcham breaking upand multitudinously dispersing he should be able to meet thequestion of the social side of the process of repatriation withdue presence of mind it was impossible for reasons that heshould travel to town with the assinghams it was impossible forthe same reasons that he should travel to town save in theconditions that he had for the last twenty four hours beenprivately and it might have been said profoundly thinking out the result of his thought was already precious to him and thisput at his service he sufficiently believed the right tone fordisposing of his elder friend s suggestion an assumption in factequally full and mild that he and charlotte would convenientlytake the same train and occupy the same compartment as thecolonel and herself the extension of the idea to mrs verver hadbeen precisely a part of mrs assingham s mildness and nothingcould better have characterised her sense for social shades thanher easy perception that the gentleman from portland place andthe lady from eaton square might now confess quite withoutindiscretion to simultaneity of movement she had made for thefour days no direct appeal to the latter personage but theprince was accidental witness of her taking a fresh start at themoment the company were about to scatter for the last night oftheir stay there had been at this climax the usual preparatorytalk about hours and combinations in the midst of which poorfanny gently approached mrs verver she said you and theprince love quite apparently without blinking she took forgranted their public withdrawal together she remarked that sheand bob were alike ready in the interest of sociability to takeany train that would make them all one party i feel really asif all this time i had seen nothing of you that gave an addedgrace to the candour of the dear thing s approach but just thenit was on the other hand that the young man found himselfborrow most effectively the secret of the right tone for doing ashe preferred his preference had during the evening not failedof occasion to press him with mute insistences practicallywithout words without any sort of straight telegraphy it hadarrived at a felt identity with charlotte s own she spoke allfor their friend while she answered their friend s question butshe none the less signalled to him as definitely as if she hadfluttered a white handkerchief from a window it s awfully sweetof you darling our going together would be charming but youmustn t mind us you must suit yourselves we ve settled amerigoand i to stay over till after luncheon amerigo with the chink of this gold in his ear turned straightaway so as not to be instantly appealed to and for the veryemotion of the wonder furthermore of what divination mayachieve when winged by a community of passion charlotte haduttered the exact plea that he had been keeping ready for thesame foreseen necessity and had uttered it simply as aconsequence of their deepening unexpressed need of each other andwithout the passing between them of a word he hadn t god knew to take it from her he was too conscious of what he wanted butthe lesson for him was in the straight clear tone that charlottecould thus distil in the perfect felicity of her adding noexplanation no touch for plausibility that she wasn t strictlyobliged to add and in the truly superior way in which women sosituated express and distinguish themselves she had answeredmrs assingham quite adequately she had not spoiled it by areason a scrap larger than the smallest that would serve and shehad above all thrown off for his stretched but coveredattention an image that flashed like a mirror played at the faceof the sun the measure of everything to all his sense at thesemoments was in it the measure especially of the thought thathad been growing with him a positive obsession and that began tothrob as never yet under this brush of her having by perfectparity of imagination the match for it his whole consciousnesshad by this time begun almost to ache with a truth of anexquisite order at the glow of which she too had sounmistakably then been warming herself the truth that theoccasion constituted by the last few days couldn t possibly saveby some poverty of their own refuse them some still other andstill greater beauty it had already told them with an hourlyvoice that it had a meaning a meaning that their associatedsense was to drain even as thirsty lips after the plough throughthe sands and the sight afar of the palm cluster might drinkin at last the promised well in the desert there had beenbeauty day after day and there had been for the spirituallips something of the pervasive taste of it yet it was all none the less as if their response had remained below theirfortune how to bring it by some brave free lift up to thesame height was the idea with which behind and beneatheverything he was restlessly occupied and in the exploration ofwhich as in that of the sun chequered greenwood of romance hisspirit thus at the opening of a vista met hers they werealready from that moment so hand in hand in the place that hefound himself making use five minutes later of exactly the sametone as charlotte s for telling mrs assingham that he waslikewise in the matter of the return to london sorry for whatmightn t be this had become of a sudden the simplest thing in the world the sense of which moreover seemed really to amount to a portentthat he should feel forevermore on the general head conveniently at his ease with her he went in fact a step furtherthan charlotte put the latter forward as creating his necessity she was staying over luncheon to oblige their hostess as aconsequence of which he must also stay to see her decently home he must deliver her safe and sound he felt in eaton square regret as he might too the difference made by this obligation he frankly didn t mind inasmuch as over and above the pleasureitself his scruple would certainly gratify both mr verver andmaggie they never yet had absolutely and entirely learned heeven found deliberation to intimate how little he reallyneglected the first as it seemed nowadays quite to have become of his domestic duties therefore he still constantly felt howlittle he must remit his effort to make them remark it to whichhe added with equal lucidity that they would return in time fordinner and if he didn t as a last word subjoin that it wouldbe lovely of fanny to find on her own return a moment to goto eaton square and report them as struggling bravely on thiswas not because the impulse down to the very name for theamiable act altogether failed to rise his inward assurance hisgeneral plan had at moments where she was concerned its dropsof continuity and nothing would less have pleased him than thatshe should suspect in him however tempted any element ofconscious cheek but he was always that was really theupshot cultivating thanklessly the considerate and the delicate it was a long lesson this unlearning with people of englishrace all the little superstitions that accompany friendship mrs assingham herself was the first to say that she wouldunfailingly report she brought it out in fact he thought quite wonderfully having attained the summit of the wonderfulduring the brief interval that had separated her appeal tocharlotte from this passage with himself she had taken the fiveminutes obviously amid the rest of the talk and the movement to retire into her tent for meditation which showed amongseveral things the impression charlotte had made on her it wasfrom the tent she emerged as with arms refurbished though whoindeed could say if the manner in which she now met him spokemost really of the glitter of battle or of the white waver ofthe flag of truce the parley was short either way the gallantryof her offer was all sufficient i ll go to our friends then i ll ask for luncheon i ll tellthem when to expect you that will be charming say we re all right all right precisely i can t say more mrs assingham smiled no doubt but he considered as for the possible importance ofit neither can you by what i seem to feel say less oh i won t say less fanny laughed with which the nextmoment she had turned away but they had it again not lessbravely on the morrow after breakfast in the thick of theadvancing carriages and the exchange of farewells i think i llsend home my maid from euston she was then prepared to amend and go to eaton square straight so you can be easy oh i think we re easy the prince returned be sure to say at any rate that we re bearing up you re bearing up good and charlotte returns to dinner to dinner we re not likely i think to make another nightaway well then i wish you at least a pleasant day oh he laughed as they separated we shall do our best forit after which in due course with the announcement of theirconveyance the assinghams rolled off xxiiit was quite for the prince after this as if the view hadfurther cleared so that the half hour during which he strolledon the terrace and smoked the day being lovely overflowed withthe plenitude of its particular quality its general brightnesswas composed doubtless of many elements but what shone out ofit as if the whole place and time had been a great picture fromthe hand of genius presented to him as a prime ornament for hiscollection and all varnished and framed to hang up what markedit especially for the highest appreciation was hisextraordinarily unchallenged his absolutely appointed andenhanced possession of it poor fanny assingham s challengeamounted to nothing one of the things he thought of while heleaned on the old marble balustrade so like others that he knewin still more nobly terraced italy was that she was squared all conveniently even to herself and that rumbling towardlondon with this contentment she had become an image irrelevantto the scene it further passed across him as his imaginationwas for reasons during the time unprecedentedly active thathe had after all gained more from women than he had ever lostby them there appeared so more and more on those mystic booksthat are kept in connection with such commerce even by men ofthe loosest business habits a balance in his favour that hecould pretty well as a rule take for granted what were theydoing at this very moment wonderful creatures but combine andconspire for his advantage from maggie herself most wonderful in her way of all to his hostess of the present hour intowhose head it had so inevitably come to keep charlotte on forreasons of her own and who had asked in this benevolent spirit why in the world if not obliged without plausibility to hurry her husband s son in law should not wait over in her company hewould at least see lady castledean had said that nothingdreadful should happen to her either while still there or duringthe exposure of the run to town and for that matter if theyexceeded a little their license it would positively help them tohave done so together each of them would in this way at home have the other comfortably to blame all of which besides inlady castledean as in maggie in fanny assingham as in charlotteherself was working for him without provocation or pressure bythe mere play of some vague sense on their part definite andconscious at the most only in charlotte that he was not as anature as a character as a gentleman in fine below hisremarkable fortune but there were more things before him than even these thingsthat melted together almost indistinguishably to feed his senseof beauty if the outlook was in every way spacious and thetowers of three cathedrals in different counties as had beenpointed out to him gleamed discernibly like dim silver in therich sameness of tone didn t he somehow the more feel it sobecause precisely lady castledean had kept over a man of herown and that this offered a certain sweet intelligibility as thenote of the day it made everything fit above all it divertedhim to the extent of keeping up while he lingered and waited his meditative smile she had detained charlotte because shewished to detain mr blint and she couldn t detain mr blint disposed though he clearly was to oblige her without spreadingover the act some ampler drapery castledean had gone up tolondon the place was all her own she had had a fancy for aquiet morning with mr blint a sleek civil accomplished youngman distinctly younger than her ladyship who played and sangdelightfully played even bridge and sang the english comic aswell as the french tragic and the presence which really meantthe absence of a couple of other friends if they were happilychosen would make everything all right the prince had thesense all good humouredly of being happily chosen and it wasnot spoiled for him even by another sense that followed in itstrain and with which during his life in england he had morethan once had reflectively to deal the state of being remindedhow after all as an outsider a foreigner and even as a mererepresentative husband and son in law he was so irrelevant tothe working of affairs that he could be bent on occasion to usescomparatively trivial no other of her guests would have beenthus convenient for their hostess affairs of whatever sorts had claimed by early trains every active easy smoothly working man each in his way a lubricated item of thegreat social political administrative engrenage claimed mostof all castledean himself who was so very oddly given thepersonage and the type rather a large item if he on the otherhand had an affair it was not of that order it was of theorder verily that he had been reduced to as a not quiteglorious substitute it marked however the feeling of the hour with him that thisvision of being reduced interfered not at all with the measureof his actual ease it kept before him again at moments the sofamiliar fact of his sacrifices down to the idea of the veryrelinquishment for his wife s convenience of his real situationin the world with the consequence thus that he was in thelast analysis among all these so often inferior people practically held cheap and made light of but though all this wassensible enough there was a spirit in him that could rise aboveit a spirit that positively played with the facts with all ofthem from that of the droll ambiguity of english relations tothat of his having in mind something quite beautiful andindependent and harmonious something wholly his own he couldn tsomehow take mr blint seriously he was much more an outsider by the larger scale even than a roman prince who consented to bein abeyance yet it was past finding out either how such awoman as lady castledean could take him since this question butsank for him again into the fathomless depths of englishequivocation he knew them all as was said well he had livedwith them stayed with them dined hunted shot and done variousother things with them but the number of questions about them hecouldn t have answered had much rather grown than shrunken sothat experience struck him for the most part as having left inhim but one residual impression they didn t like les situationsnettes that was all he was very sure of they wouldn t have themat any price it had been their national genius and theirnational success to avoid them at every point they called itthemselves with complacency their wonderful spirit ofcompromise the very influence of which actually so hung abouthim here from moment to moment that the earth and the air thelight and the colour the fields and the hills and the sky theblue green counties and the cold cathedrals owed to it everyaccent of their tone verily as one had to feel in presence ofsuch a picture it had succeeded it had made up to now forthat seated solidity in the rich sea mist on which the garish the supposedly envious peoples have ever cooled their eyes butit was at the same time precisely why even much initiation leftone at given moments so puzzled as to the element of stalenessin all the freshness and of freshness in all the staleness ofinnocence in the guilt and of guilt in the innocence there wereother marble terraces sweeping more purple prospects on whichhe would have known what to think and would have enjoyed therebyat least the small intellectual fillip of a discerned relationbetween a given appearance and a taken meaning the inquiringmind in these present conditions might it was true be moresharply challenged but the result of its attention and itsingenuity it had unluckily learned to know was too often to beconfronted with a mere dead wall a lapse of logic a confirmedbewilderment and moreover above all nothing mattered in therelation of the enclosing scene to his own consciousness but itsvery most direct bearings lady castledean s dream of mr blint for the morning wasdoubtless already with all the spacious harmonies re established taking the form of going over something with him at the piano in one of the numerous smaller rooms that wereconsecrated to the less gregarious uses what she had wished hadbeen effected her convenience had been assured this made him however wonder the more where charlotte was since he didn t atall suppose her to be making a tactless third which would be tohave accepted mere spectatorship in the duet of theircompanions the upshot of everything for him alike of the lessand of the more was that the exquisite day bloomed there like alarge fragrant flower that he had only to gather but it was tocharlotte he wished to make the offering and as he moved alongthe terrace which rendered visible parts of two sides of thehouse he looked up at all the windows that were open to theapril morning and wondered which of them would represent hisfriend s room it befell thus that his question after no longtime was answered he saw charlotte appear above as if she hadbeen called by the pausing of his feet on the flags she had cometo the sill on which she leaned to look down and she remainedthere a minute smiling at him he had been immediately struckwith her wearing a hat and a jacket which conduced to herappearance of readiness not so much to join him with a beautifuluncovered head and a parasol where he stood as to take with himsome larger step altogether the larger step had been since theevening before intensely in his own mind though he had notfully thought out even yet the slightly difficult detail of it but he had had no chance such as he needed to speak thedefinite word to her and the face she now showed affected him accordingly as a notice that she had wonderfully guessed it forherself they had these identities of impulse they had had themrepeatedly before and if such unarranged but unerring encountersgave the measure of the degree in which people were in thecommon phrase meant for each other no union in the world hadever been more sweetened with rightness what in fact most oftenhappened was that her rightness went as who should say evenfurther than his own they were conscious of the same necessityat the same moment only it was she as a general thing who mostclearly saw her way to it something in her long look at him nowout of the old grey window something in the very poise of herhat the colour of her necktie the prolonged stillness of hersmile touched into sudden light for him all the wealth of thefact that he could count on her he had his hand there to pluckit on the open bloom of the day but what did the bright minutemean but that her answering hand was already intelligently out so therefore while the minute lasted it passed between themthat their cup was full which cup their very eyes holding itfast carried and steadied and began as they tasted it topraise he broke however after a moment the silence it only wants a moon a mandolin and a little danger to be aserenade ah then she lightly called down let it at least have this with which she detached a rich white rosebud from its companywith another in the front of her dress and flung it down to him he caught it in its fall fixing her again after she had watchedhim place it in his buttonhole come down quickly he said inan italian not loud but deep vengo vengo she as clearly but more lightly tossed out andshe had left him the next minute to wait for her he came along the terrace again with pauses during which hiseyes rested as they had already often done on the brave darkerwash of far away watercolour that represented the most distant ofthe cathedral towns this place with its great church and itshigh accessibility its towers that distinguishably signalled its english history its appealing type its acknowledgedinterest this place had sounded its name to him half the nightthrough and its name had become but another name thepronounceable and convenient one for that supreme sense ofthings which now throbbed within him he had kept saying tohimself gloucester gloucester gloucester quite as if thesharpest meaning of all the years just passed were intenselyexpressed in it that meaning was really that his situationremained quite sublimely consistent with itself and that theyabsolutely he and charlotte stood there together in the verylustre of this truth every present circumstance helped toproclaim it it was blown into their faces as by the lips of themorning he knew why from the first of his marriage he hadtried with such patience for such conformity he knew why he hadgiven up so much and bored himself so much he knew why he atany rate had gone in on the basis of all forms on the basis ofhis having in a manner sold himself for a situation nette ithad all been just in order that his well what on earth shouldhe call it but his freedom should at present be as perfect androunded and lustrous as some huge precious pearl he hadn tstruggled nor snatched he was taking but what had been givenhim the pearl dropped itself with its exquisite quality andrarity straight into his hand here precisely it was incarnate its size and its value grew as mrs verver appeared afar off in one of the smaller doorways she came toward him insilence while he moved to meet her the great scale of thisparticular front at matcham multiplied thus in the goldenmorning the stages of their meeting and the successions of theirconsciousness it wasn t till she had come quite close that heproduced for her his gloucester gloucester gloucester and his look at it over there she knew just where to look yes isn t it one of the best there are cloisters or towers or some thing and her eyes which though her lips smiled were almost grave with theirdepths of acceptance came back to him or the tomb of some oldking we must see the old king we must do the cathedral he said we must know all about it if we could but take he exhaled the full opportunity and then while for all they seemed togive him he sounded again her eyes i feel the day like a greatgold cup that we must somehow drain together i feel it as you always make me feel everything just as youdo so that i know ten miles off how you feel but do youremember she asked apropos of great gold cups the beautifulone the real one that i offered you so long ago and that youwouldn t have just before your marriage she brought it back tohim the gilded crystal bowl in the little bloomsbury shop oh yes but it took with a slight surprise on the prince spart some small recollecting the treacherous cracked thing youwanted to palm off on me and the little swindling jew whounderstood italian and who backed you up but i feel this anoccasion he immediately added and i hope you don t mean hesmiled that as an occasion it s also cracked they spoke naturally more low than loud overlooked as theywere though at a respectful distance by tiers of windows butit made each find in the other s voice a taste as of somethingslowly and deeply absorbed don t you think too much of cracks and aren t you too afraid of them i risk the cracks said charlotte and i ve often recalled the bowl and the littleswindling jew wondering if they ve parted company he made shesaid a great impression on me well you also no doubt made a great impression on him and idare say that if you were to go back to him you d find he hasbeen keeping that treasure for you but as to cracks the princewent on what did you tell me the other day you prettily callthem in english rifts within the lute risk them as much asyou like for yourself but don t risk them for me he spoke itin all the gaiety of his just barely tremulous serenity i go as you know by my superstitions and that s why he said iknow where we are they re every one to day on our side resting on the parapet toward the great view she was silent alittle and he saw the next moment that her eyes were closed igo but by one thing her hand was on the sun warmed stone sothat turned as they were away from the house he put hisown upon it and covered it i go by you she said i go byyou so they remained a moment till he spoke again with a gesturethat matched what is really our great necessity you know isto go by my watch it s already eleven he had looked at thetime so that if we stop here to luncheon what becomes of ourafternoon to this charlotte s eyes opened straight there s not theslightest need of our stopping here to luncheon don t you see she asked how i m ready he had taken it in but there wasalways more and more of her you mean you ve arranged it s easy to arrange my maid goes up with my things you veonly to speak to your man about yours and they can go together you mean we can leave at once she let him have it all one of the carriages about which ispoke will already have come back for us if your superstitionsare on our side she smiled so my arrangements are and i llback my support against yours then you had thought he wondered about gloucester she hesitated but it was only her way i thought you wouldthink we have thank goodness these harmonies they are foodfor superstition if you like it s beautiful she went on thatit should be gloucester glo ster glo ster as you say makingit sound like an old song however i m sure glo ster glo sterwill be charming she still added we shall be able easily tolunch there and with our luggage and our servants off ourhands we shall have at least three or four hours we can wire she wound up from there ever so quietly she had brought it as she had thought it allout and it had to be as covertly that he let his appreciationexpand then lady castledean doesn t dream of our staying he took it but thinking yet then what does she dream of mr blint poor dear of mr blint only her smile for him for the prince himself was free have i positively to tell youthat she doesn t want us she only wanted us for the others toshow she wasn t left alone with him now that that s done andthat they ve all gone she of course knows for herself knows the prince vaguely echoed why that we like cathedrals that we inevitably stop to seethem or go round to take them in whenever we ve a chance thatit s what our respective families quite expect of us and would bedisappointed for us to fail of this as forestieri mrs ververpursued would be our pull if our pull weren t indeed so greatall round he could only keep his eyes on her and have you made out thevery train the very one paddington the in that gives us oceans we can dine at the usual hour at home and as maggie will ofcourse be in eaton square i hereby invite you for a while he still but looked at her it was a minute before hespoke thank you very much with pleasure to which he in amoment added but the train for gloucester a local one with several stops but doing it a gooddeal i forget how much within the hour so that we ve time only she said we must employ our time he roused himself as from the mere momentary spell of her helooked again at his watch while they moved back to the doorthrough which she had advanced but he had also again questionsand stops all as for the mystery and the charm you looked itup without my having asked you ah my dear she laughed i ve seen you with bradshaw ittakes anglo saxon blood blood he echoed you ve that of every race it kept herbefore him you re terrible well he could put it as he liked i know the name of the inn what is it then there are two you ll see but i ve chosen the right one and ithink i remember the tomb she smiled oh the tomb any tomb would do for him but i mean i hadbeen keeping my idea so cleverly for you while there you alreadywere with it you had been keeping it for me as much as you like but how doyou make out she asked that you were keeping it from me i don t now how shall i ever keep anything some day when ishall wish to ah for things i mayn t want to know i promise you shall findme stupid they had reached their door where she herself pausedto explain these days yesterday last night this morning i ve wanted everything well it was all right you shall have everything xxiiifanny on her arrival in town carried out her second idea despatching the colonel to his club for luncheon and packing hermaid into a cab for cadogan place with the variety of theireffects the result of this for each of the pair was a state ofoccupation so unbroken that the day practically passed withoutfresh contact between them they dined out together but it wasboth in going to their dinner and in coming back that theyappeared on either side to have least to communicate fanny waswrapped in her thoughts still more closely than in the lemon coloured mantle that protected her bare shoulders and herhusband with her silence to deal with showed himself not lessdisposed than usual when so challenged to hold up as he wouldhave said his end of it they had in general in these days longer pauses and more abrupt transitions in one of which latterthey found themselves for a climax launched at midnight mrs assingham rather wearily housed again ascended to the firstfloor there to sink overburdened on the landing outside thedrawing room into a great gilded venetian chair of which atfirst however she but made with her brooding face a sort ofthrone of meditation she would thus have recalled a little withher so free orientalism of type the immemorially speechlesssphinx about at last to become articulate the colonel notunlike on his side some old pilgrim of the desert camping atthe foot of that monument went by way of reconnoissance intothe drawing room he visited according to his wont the windowsand their fastenings he cast round the place the eye all atonce of the master and the manager the commandant and therate payer then he came back to his wife before whom for amoment he stood waiting but she herself for a time continuedto wait only looking up at him inscrutably there was in theseminor manoeuvres and conscious patiences something of asuspension of their old custom of divergent discussion thatintercourse by misunderstanding which had grown so clumsy now this familiar pleasantry seemed to desire to show it could yield on occasion to any clear trouble though it was also sensibly and just incoherently in the air that no trouble was at presentto be vulgarly recognised as clear there might for that matter even have been in mr assingham sface a mild perception of some finer sense a sense for hiswife s situation and the very situation she was oddly enough about to repudiate that she had fairly caused to grow in him but it was a flower to breathe upon gently and this was verymuch what she finally did she knew he needed no telling that shehad given herself all the afternoon to her friends in eatonsquare and that her doing so would have been but the promptresult of impressions gathered in quantities in brimmingbaskets like the purple grapes of the vintage at matcham aprocess surrounded by him while it so unmistakably went on withabstentions and discretions that might almost have counted assolemnities the solemnities at the same time had committed himto nothing to nothing beyond this confession itself of aconsciousness of deep waters she had been out on these waters for him visibly and his tribute to the fact had been hiskeeping her even if without a word well in sight he had notquitted for an hour during her adventure the shore of themystic lake he had on the contrary stationed himself where shecould signal to him at need her need would have arisen if theplanks of her bark had parted then some sort of plunge wouldhave become his immediate duty his present position clearly was that of seeing her in the centre of her sheet of dark water and of wondering if her actual mute gaze at him didn t perhapsmean that her planks were now parting he held himself so readythat it was quite as if the inward man had pulled off coat andwaistcoat before he had plunged however that is before he haduttered a question he perceived not without relief that shewas making for land he watched her steadily paddle always alittle nearer and at last he felt her boat bump the bump wasdistinct and in fact she stepped ashore we were all wrong there s nothing nothing it was like giving her his hand up the bank between charlotte verver and the prince i was uneasy but i msatisfied now i was in fact quite mistaken there s nothing but i thought said bob assingham that that was just what youdid persistently asseverate you ve guaranteed their straightnessfrom the first no i ve never till now guaranteed anything but my owndisposition to worry i ve never till now fanny went on gravelyfrom her chair had such a chance to see and to judge i had itat that place if i had in my infatuation and my folly sheadded with expression nothing else so i did see i have seen and now i know her emphasis as she repeated the word made herhead in her seat of infallibility rise higher i know the colonel took it but took it at first in silence do youmean they ve told you no i mean nothing so absurd for in the first place i haven tasked them and in the second their word in such a matterwouldn t count oh said the colonel with all his oddity they d tell us it made her face him an instant as with her old impatience of hisshort cuts always across her finest flower beds but she felt none the less that she kept her irony down then when they vetold you you ll be perhaps so good as to let me know he jerked up his chin testing the growth of his beard with theback of his hand while he fixed her with a single eye ah idon t say that they d necessarily tell me that they are over thetraces they ll necessarily whatever happens hold their tongues ihope and i m talking of them now as i take them for myself only that s enough for me it s all i have to regard with which after an instant they re wonderful said fanny assingham indeed her husband concurred i really think they are you d think it still more if you knew but you don t know because you don t see their situation this was what he didn tsee is too extraordinary too he was willing to try too extraordinary to be believed i mean if one didn t see butjust that in a way is what saves them they take it seriously he followed at his own pace their situation the incredible side of it they make it credible credible then you do say to you she looked at him again for an interval they believe in itthemselves they take it for what it is and that she said saves them but if what it is is just their chance it s their chance for what i told you when charlotte firstturned up it s their chance for the idea that i was then sureshe had the colonel showed his effort to recall oh your idea atdifferent moments of any one of their ideas this dimprocession visibly mustered before him and with the best willin the world he could but watch its immensity are you speakingnow of something to which you can comfortably settle down again for a little she only glowered at him i ve come backto my belief and that i have done so well he asked as she paused well shows that i m right for i assure you i had wandered far now i m at home again and i mean said fanny assingham tostay here they re beautiful she declared the prince and charlotte the prince and charlotte that s how they re so remarkable andthe beauty she explained is that they re afraid for them afraid i mean for the others for mr verver and maggie it did take some following afraidof what afraid of themselves the colonel wondered of themselves of mr verver s andmaggie s selves mrs assingham remained patient as well as lucid yes of suchblindness too but most of all of their own danger he turned it over that danger being the blindness that danger being their position what their position contains of all the elements i needn t at this time of day attempt totell you it contains luckily for that s the mercy everything but blindness i mean on their part the blindness said fanny is primarily her husband s he stood for a moment he would have it straight whosehusband s mr verver s she went on the blindness is most of all his that they feel that they see but it s also his wife s whose wife s he asked as she continued to gloom at him in amanner at variance with the comparative cheer of her contention and then as she only gloomed the prince s maggie s own maggie s very own she pursued as for herself he had a pause do you think maggie so blind the question isn t of what i think the question s of theconviction that guides the prince and charlotte who have betteropportunities than i for judging the colonel again wondered are you so very sure theiropportunities are better well his wife asked what is their whole so extraordinarysituation their extraordinary relation but an opportunity ah my dear you have that opportunity of their extraordinarysituation and relation as much as they with the difference darling she returned with some spirit that neither of those matters are if you please mine i seethe boat they re in but i m not thank god in it myself to day however mrs assingham added to day in eaton square idid see well then what but she mused over it still oh many things more somehow than ever before it was as if god help me i was seeing forthem i mean for the others it was as if something hadhappened i don t know what except some effect of these dayswith them at that place that had either made things come out orhad cleared my own eyes these eyes indeed of the poor lady srested on her companion s meanwhile with the lustre not so muchof intenser insight as of a particular portent that he had atvarious other times had occasion to recognise she desired obviously to reassure him but it apparently took a couple oflarge candid gathering glittering tears to emphasisethe fact they had immediately for him their usual directaction she must reassure him he was made to feel absolutely inher own way he would adopt it and conform to it as soon as heshould be able to make it out the only thing was that it tooksuch incalculable twists and turns the twist seemed remarkablefor instance as she developed her indication of what had come outin the afternoon it was as if i knew better than ever whatmakes them what makes them he pressed her as she fitfully dropped well makes the prince and charlotte take it all as they do itmight well have been difficult to know how to take it and theymay even say for themselves that they were a long time trying tosee as i say to day she went on it was as if i weresuddenly with a kind of horrible push seeing through theireyes on which as to shake off her perversity fannyassingham sprang up but she remained there under the dimillumination and while the colonel with his high dry sparelook of type to which a certain conformity to the whiteness ofinaccessible snows in his necktie shirt front and waistcoat gavea rigour of accent waited watching her they might at the latehour and in the still house have been a pair of specious worldlyadventurers driven for relief under sudden stress to some grimmidnight reckoning in an odd corner her attention movedmechanically over the objects of ornament disposed too freely onthe walls of staircase and landing as to which recognition forthe time had lost both fondness and compunction i can imaginethe way it works she said it s so easy to understand yet idon t want to be wrong she the next moment broke out i don t i don t want to be wrong to make a mistake you mean oh no she meant nothing of the sort she knew but too well whatshe meant i don t make mistakes but i perpetrate in thought crimes and she spoke with all intensity i m a most dreadfulperson there are times when i seem not to mind a bit what i vedone or what i think or imagine or fear or accept when i feelthat i d do it again feel that i d do things myself ah my dear the colonel remarked in the coolness of debate yes if you had driven me back on my nature luckily for youyou never have you ve done every thing else but you ve neverdone that but what i really don t a bit want she declared isto abet them or to protect them her companion turned this over what is there to protect themfrom if by your now so settled faith they ve done nothingthat justly exposes them and it in fact half pulled her up well from a sudden scare from the alarm i mean of what maggie may think yet if your whole idea is that maggie thinks nothing she waited again it isn t my whole idea nothing is my whole idea for i felt to day as i tell you that there s somuch in the air oh in the air the colonel dryly breathed well what s in the air always has hasn t it to come down tothe earth and maggie mrs assingham continued is a verycurious little person since i was in this afternoon forseeing more than i had ever done well i felt that too for somereason as i hadn t yet felt it for some reason for what reason and then as his wife atfirst said nothing did she give any sign was she in any waydifferent she s always so different from anyone else in the world thatit s hard to say when she s different from herself but she hasmade me said fanny after an instant think of her differently she drove me home home here first to portland place on her leaving her father since shedoes once in a while leave him that was to keep me with her alittle longer but she kept the carriage and after tea there came with me herself back here this was also for the samepurpose then she went home though i had brought her a messagefrom the prince that arranged their movements otherwise he andcharlotte must have arrived if they have arrived expecting todrive together to eaton square and keep maggie on to dinnerthere she has everything there you know she has clothes the colonel didn t in fact know but he gave it his apprehension oh you mean a change twenty changes if you like all sorts of things she dresses really maggie does as much for her father and she always did as for her husband or for herself she has her room in his housevery much as she had it before she was married and just as theboy has quite a second nursery there in which mrs noble whenshe comes with him makes herself i assure you at home si bienthat if charlotte in her own house so to speak should wish afriend or two to stay with her she really would be scarce ableto put them up it was a picture into which as a thrifty entertainer himself bob assingham could more or less enter maggie and the childspread so maggie and the child spread so well he considered it is rather rum that s all i claim she seemed thankful for the word i don tsay it s anything more but it is distinctly rum which after an instant the colonel took up more what morecould it be it could be that she s unhappy and that she takes her funnylittle way of consoling herself for if she were unhappy mrs assingham had figured it out that s just the way i mconvinced she would take but how can she be unhappy since asi m also convinced she in the midst of everything adores herhusband as much as ever the colonel at this brooded for a little at large then if she sso happy please what s the matter it made his wife almost spring at him you think then she ssecretly wretched but he threw up his arms in deprecation ah my dear i givethem up to you i ve nothing more to suggest then it s not sweet of you she spoke at present as if he werefrequently sweet you admit that it is rum and this indeed fixed again for a moment his intention hascharlotte complained of the want of rooms for her friends never that i know of a word it isn t the sort of thing shedoes and whom has she after all mrs assingham added tocomplain to hasn t she always you oh me charlotte and i nowadays she spoke as of achapter closed yet see the justice i still do her she strikesme more and more as extraordinary a deeper shade at the renewal of the word had come into thecolonel s face if they re each and all so extraordinary then isn t that why one must just resign one s self to wash one shands of them to be lost her face however so met thequestion as if it were but a flicker of the old tone that theirtrouble had now become too real for her charged eyes so betrayedthe condition of her nerves that he stepped back alertly enough to firmer ground he had spoken before in this light of a plainman s vision but he must be something more than a plain man now hasn t she then charlotte always her husband to complain to she d rather die oh and bob assingham s face at the vision of suchextremities lengthened for very docility hasn t she the princethen for such matters oh he doesn t count i thought that was just what as the basis of our agitation hedoes do mrs assingham however had her distinction ready not a bit asa person to bore with complaints the ground of my agitation is exactly that she never on any pretext bores him not charlotte and in the imagination of mrs verver s superiority to any suchmistake she gave characteristically something like a toss ofher head as marked a tribute to that lady s general grace inall the conditions as the personage referred to doubtless hadever received ah only maggie with which the colonel gave a short lowgurgle but it found his wife again prepared no not only maggie a great many people in london and smallwonder bore him maggie only worst then but it was a question that he hadpromptly dropped at the returning brush of another of which shehad shortly before sown the seed you said just now that hewould by this time be back with charlotte if they have arrived you think it then possible that they really won t have returned his companion exhibited to view for the idea a sense of herresponsibility but this was insufficient clearly to keep herfrom entertaining it i think there s nothing they re not nowcapable of in their so intense good faith good faith he echoed the words which had in fact somethingof an odd ring critically their false position it comes to the same thing and she boredown with her decision the superficial lack of sequence theymay very possibly for a demonstration as i see them not havecome back he wondered visibly at this how she did see them may havebolted somewhere together may have stayed over at matcham itself till tomorrow may havewired home each of them since maggie left me may have done fanny assingham continued god knows what she went on suddenly with more emotion which at the pressure of somespring of her inner vision broke out in a wail of distress imperfectly smothered whatever they ve done i shall never know never never because i don t want to and because nothing willinduce me so they may do as they like but i ve worked for themall she uttered this last with another irrepressible quaver andthe next moment her tears had come though she had with theexplosion quitted her husband as if to hide it from him shepassed into the dusky drawing room where during his own prowl shortly previous he had drawn up a blind so that the light ofthe street lamps came in a little at the window she made forthis window against which she leaned her head while thecolonel with his lengthened face looked after her for a minuteand hesitated he might have been wondering what she had reallydone to what extent beyond his knowledge or his conception inthe affairs of these people she could have committed herself but to hear her cry and yet try not to was quickly enough toomuch for him he had known her at other times quite not try notto and that had not been so bad he went to her and put his armround her he drew her head to his breast where while shegasped she let it stay a little all with a patience thatpresently stilled her yet the effect of this small crisis oddlyenough was not to close their colloquy with the natural resultof sending them to bed what was between them had opened outfurther had somehow through the sharp show of her feeling taken a positive stride had entered as it were without morewords the region of the understood shutting the door after itand bringing them so still more nearly face to face theyremained for some minutes looking at it through the dim windowwhich opened upon the world of human trouble in general and whichlet the vague light play here and there upon gilt and crystal andcolour the florid features looming dimly of fanny sdrawing room and the beauty of what thus passed between them passed with her cry of pain with her burst of tears with hiswonderment and his kindness and his comfort with the moments oftheir silence above all which might have represented theirsinking together hand in hand for a time into the mystic lakewhere he had begun as we have hinted by seeing her paddlealone the beauty of it was that they now could really talkbetter than before because the basis had at last once for all defined itself what was the basis which fanny absolutelyexacted but that charlotte and the prince must be saved so faras consistently speaking of them as still safe might save them it did save them somehow for fanny s troubled mind for thatwas the nature of the mind of women he conveyed to her now atall events by refusing her no gentleness that he hadsufficiently got the tip and that the tip was all he had wanted this remained quite clear even when he presently reverted to whatshe had told him of her recent passage with maggie i don taltogether see you know what you infer from it or why youinfer anything when he so expressed himself it was quite as ifin possession of what they had brought up from the depths xxiv i can t say more this made his companion reply than thatsomething in her face her voice and her whole manner acted uponme as nothing in her had ever acted before and just for thereason above all that i felt her trying her very best and hervery best poor duck is very good to be quiet and natural it swhen one sees people who always are natural making little pale pathetic blinking efforts for it then it is that one knowssomething s the matter i can t describe my impression you wouldhave had it for yourself and the only thing that ever can be thematter with maggie is that by that i mean her beginning todoubt to doubt for the first time mrs assingham wound up of her wonderful little judgment of her wonderful little world it was impressive fanny s vision and the colonel as if himselfagitated by it took another turn of prowling to doubt offidelity to doubt of friendship poor duck indeed it will gohard with her but she ll put it all he concluded oncharlotte mrs assingham still darkly contemplative denied this with aheadshake she won t put it anywhere she won t do with itanything anyone else would she ll take it all herself you mean she ll make it out her own fault yes she ll find means somehow to arrive at that ah then the colonel dutifully declared she s indeed a littlebrick oh his wife returned you ll see in one way or another towhat tune and she spoke of a sudden with an approach toelation so that as if immediately feeling his surprise sheturned round to him she ll see me somehow through see you yes me i m the worst for said fanny assingham now with aharder exaltation i did it all i recognise that i accept it she won t cast it up at me she won t cast up anything so ithrow myself upon her she ll bear me up she spoke almostvolubly she held him with her sudden sharpness she ll carrythe whole weight of us there was still nevertheless wonder in it you mean she won tmind i say love and he not unkindly stared then where sthe difficulty there isn t any fanny declared with the same rich emphasis it kept him indeed as by the loss of the thread looking at herlonger ah you mean there isn t any for us she met his look for a minute as if it perhaps a little too muchimputed a selfishness a concern at any cost for their ownsurface then she might have been deciding that their own surfacewas after all what they had most to consider not she saidwith dignity if we properly keep our heads she appeared evento signify that they would begin by keeping them now this waswhat it was to have at last a constituted basis do you rememberwhat you said to me that night of my first real anxiety afterthe foreign office party in the carriage as we came home yes he could recall it leave them to pull through precisely trust their own wit you practically said to saveall appearances well i ve trusted it i have left them to pullthrough he hesitated and your point is that they re not doing so i ve left them she went on but now i see how and where i vebeen leaving them all the while without knowing it to her to the princess and that s what i mean mrs assingham pensively pursued that s what happened to me with her to day she continued toexplain it came home to me that that s what i ve really beendoing oh i see i needn t torment myself she has taken them over the colonel declared that he saw yet it was as if at this hea little sightlessly stared but what then has happened fromone day to the other to her what has opened her eyes they were never really shut she misses him then why hasn t she missed him before well facing him there among their domestic glooms and glints fanny worked it out she did but she wouldn t let herself knowit she had her reason she wore her blind now at last hersituation has come to a head to day she does know it and that silluminating it has been mrs assingham wound up illuminating to me her husband attended but the momentary effect of his attentionwas vagueness again and the refuge of his vagueness was a gasp poor dear little girl ah no don t pity her this did however pull him up we mayn t even be sorry forher not now or at least not yet it s too soon that is if it isn tvery much too late this will depend mrs assingham went on at any rate we shall see we might have pitied her before forall the good it would then have done her we might have begunsome time ago now however she has begun to live and the wayit comes to me the way it comes to me but again she projectedher vision the way it comes to you can scarcely be that she ll like it the way it comes to me is that she will live the way it comesto me is that she ll triumph she said this with so sudden a prophetic flare that it fairlycheered her husband ah then we must back her no we mustn t touch her we mayn t touch any of them we mustkeep our hands off we must go on tiptoe we must simply watchand wait and meanwhile said mrs assingham we must bear itas we can that s where we are and serves us right we re inpresence and so moving about the room as in communion with shadowyportents she left it till he questioned again in presence ofwhat well of something possibly beautiful beautiful as it may comeoff she had paused there before him while he wondered you meanshe ll get the prince back she raised her hand in quick impatience the suggestion mighthave been almost abject it isn t a question of recovery itwon t be a question of any vulgar struggle to get him back shemust have lost him and to have lost him she must have had him with which fanny shook her head what i take her to be wakingup to is the truth that all the while she really hasn t hadhim never ah my dear the poor colonel panted never his wife repeated and she went on without pity do youremember what i said to you long ago that evening just beforetheir marriage when charlotte had so suddenly turned up the smile with which he met this appeal was not it was to befeared robust what haven t you love said in your time so many things no doubt that they make a chance for my havingonce or twice spoken the truth i never spoke it more at allevents than when i put it to you that evening that maggie wasthe person in the world to whom a wrong thing could least becommunicated it was as if her imagination had been closed to it her sense altogether sealed that therefore fanny continued is what will now have to happen her sense will have to open i see he nodded to the wrong he nodded again almostcheerfully as if he had been keeping the peace with a baby or alunatic to the very very wrong but his wife s spirit after its effort of wing was able toremain higher to what s called evil with a very big e for thefirst time in her life to the discovery of it to the knowledgeof it to the crude experience of it and she gave for thepossibility the largest measure to the harsh bewilderingbrush the daily chilling breath of it unless indeed and heremrs assingham noted a limit unless indeed as yet so far asshe has come and if she comes no further simply to thesuspicion and the dread what we shall see is whether that meredose of alarm will prove enough he considered but enough for what then dear if not enough tobreak her heart enough to give her a shaking mrs assingham rather oddlyreplied to give her i mean the right one the right one won tbreak her heart it will make her she explained well it willmake her by way of a change understand one or two things in theworld but isn t it a pity the colonel asked that they shouldhappen to be the one or two that will be the most disagreeable toher oh disagreeable they ll have had to be disagreeable toshow her a little where she is they ll have had to bedisagreeable to make her sit up they ll have had to bedisagreeable to make her decide to live bob assingham was now at the window while his companion slowlyrevolved he had lighted a cigarette for final patience and heseemed vaguely to time her as she moved to and fro he had atthe same time to do justice to the lucidity she had at lastattained and it was doubtless by way of expression of thisteachability that he let his eyes for a minute roll as fromthe force of feeling over the upper dusk of the room he hadthought of the response his wife s words ideally implied decide to live ah yes for her child oh bother her child and he had never felt so snubbed for anexemplary view as when fanny now stopped short to live youpoor dear for her father which is another pair of sleeves and mrs assingham s whole ample ornamented person irradiated with this the truth that had begun under so much handling toglow any idiot can do things for her child she ll have amotive more original and we shall see how it will work her she ll have to save him to save him to keep her father from her own knowledge that and she seemedto see it before her in her husband s very eyes will be workcut out with which as at the highest conceivable climax shewound up their colloquy good night there was something in her manner however or in the effect atleast of this supreme demonstration that had fairly and by asingle touch lifted him to her side so that after she hadturned her back to regain the landing and the staircase heovertook her before she had begun to mount with the ring ofexcited perception ah but you know that s rather jolly jolly she turned upon it again at the foot of thestaircase i mean it s rather charming charming it had still to be their law a little that shewas tragic when he was comic i mean it s rather beautiful you just said yourself it wouldbe only he pursued promptly with the impetus of this idea and as if it had suddenly touched with light for him connectionshitherto dim only i don t quite see why that very care for himwhich has carried her to such other lengths precisely as affectone as so rum hasn t also by the same stroke made her noticea little more what has been going on ah there you are it s the question that i ve all along beenasking myself she had rested her eyes on the carpet but sheraised them as she pursued she let him have it straight andit s the question of an idiot an idiot well the idiot that i ve been in all sorts of ways so often of late have i asked it you re excusable since you ask it butnow the answer i saw to day has all the while been staring mein the face then what in the world is it why the very intensity of her conscience about him the verypassion of her brave little piety that s the way it has worked mrs assingham explained and i admit it to have been as rum away as possible but it has been working from a rum start fromthe moment the dear man married to ease his daughter off and itthen happened by an extraordinary perversity that the veryopposite effect was produced with the renewed vision of thisfatality however she could give but a desperate shrug i see the colonel sympathetically mused that was a rumstart but his very response as she again flung up her arms seemed tomake her sense for a moment intolerable yes there i am iwas really at the bottom of it she declared i don t know whatpossessed me but i planned for him i goaded him on withwhich however the next moment she took herself up or rather i do know what possessed me for wasn t he beset withravening women right and left and didn t he quitepathetically appeal for protection didn t he quite charmingly show one how he needed and desired it maggie she thus lucidlycontinued couldn t with a new life of her own give herself upto doing for him in the future all she had done in the past tofencing him in to keeping him safe and keeping them off oneperceived this she went on out of the abundance of one saffection and one s sympathy it all blessedly came back toher when it wasn t all for the fiftieth time obscured in faceof the present facts by anxiety and compunction one was nodoubt a meddlesome fool one always is to think one seespeople s lives for them better than they see them for themselves but one s excuse here she insisted was that these peopleclearly didn t see them for themselves didn t see them at all it struck one for very pity that they were making a mess of suchcharming material that they were but wasting it and letting itgo they didn t know how to live and somehow one couldn t ifone took an interest in them at all simply stand and see it that s what i pay for and the poor woman in straightercommunion with her companion s intelligence at this moment sheappeared to feel than she had ever been before let him have thewhole of the burden of her consciousness i always pay for it sooner or later my sociable my damnable my unnecessaryinterest nothing of course would suit me but that it should fixitself also on charlotte charlotte who was hovering there on theedge of our lives when not beautifully and a triflemysteriously flitting across them and who was a piece of wasteand a piece of threatened failure just as for any possible goodto the world mr verver and maggie were it began to come overme in the watches of the night that charlotte was a person whocould keep off ravening women without being one herself either in the vulgar way of the others and that this service to mr verver would be a sweet employment for her future there wassomething of course that might have stopped me you know youknow what i mean it looks at me she veritably moaned out ofyour face but all i can say is that it didn t the reasonlargely being once i had fallen in love with the beautifulsymmetry of my plan that i seemed to feel sure maggie wouldaccept charlotte whereas i didn t quite make out either whatother woman or what other kind of woman one could think of heraccepting i see i see she had paused meeting all the while hislistening look and the fever of her retrospect had so risen withher talk that the desire was visibly strong in him to meet her on his side but with cooling breath one quite understands mydear it only however kept her there sombre i naturally see love what you understand which sits again perfectly in your eyes you see that i saw that maggie would accept her in helplessignorance yes dearest and the grimness of her drearinesssuddenly once more possessed her you ve only to tell me thatthat knowledge was my reason for what i did how when you do can i stand up to you you see she said with an ineffableheadshake that i don t stand up i m down down down shedeclared yet she as quickly added there s just one littlething that helps to save my life and she kept him waiting butan instant they might easily they would perhaps evencertainly have done something worse he thought worse than that charlotte ah don t tell me she cried that there could have beennothing worse there might as they were have been many things charlotte in her way is extraordinary he was almost simultaneous extraordinary she observes the forms said fanny assingham he hesitated with the prince for the prince and with the others she went on with mr verver wonderfully but above all with maggie and the forms she had to do even them justice are two thirds of conduct say he had married a woman who would have made a hash of them but he jerked back ah my dear i wouldn t say it for theworld say she none the less pursued he had married a woman theprince would really have cared for you mean then he doesn t care for charlotte this was still anew view to jump to and the colonel perceptibly wished to makesure of the necessity of the effort for that while he stared his wife allowed him time at the end of which she simply said no then what on earth are they up to still however she onlylooked at him so that standing there before her with his handsin his pockets he had time further to risk soothingly another question are the forms you speak of that aretwo thirds of conduct what will be keeping her now by yourhypothesis from coming home with him till morning yes absolutely their forms theirs maggie s and mr verver s those they impose on charlotte andthe prince those she developed that so perversely as isay have succeeded in setting themselves up as the right ones he considered but only now at last really to relapse into woe your perversity my dear is exactly what i don t understand the state of things existing hasn t grown like a field ofmushrooms in a night whatever they all round may be in fornow is at least the consequence of what they ve done are theymere helpless victims of fate well fanny at last had the courage of it yes they are to beso abjectly innocent that is to be victims of fate and charlotte and the prince are abjectly innocent it took her another minute but she rose to the full height yes that is they were as much so in their way as the others there were beautiful intentions all round the prince s andcharlotte s were beautiful of that i had my faith they were i d go to the stake otherwise she added i should have been awretch and i ve not been a wretch i ve only been a double dyeddonkey ah then he asked what does our muddle make them to havebeen well too much taken up with considering each other you maycall such a mistake as that by what ever name you please it atany rate means all round their case it illustrates themisfortune said mrs assingham gravely of being too toocharming this was another matter that took some following but the colonelagain did his best yes but to whom doesn t it rather dependon that to whom have the prince and charlotte then been toocharming to each other in the first place obviously and then both ofthem together to maggie to maggie he wonderingly echoed to maggie she was now crystalline by having accepted fromthe first so guilelessly yes so guilelessly themselves herguileless idea of still having her father of keeping him fast in her life then isn t one supposed in common humanity and if one hasn tquarrelled with him and one has the means and he on his side doesn t drink or kick up rows isn t one supposed to keep one saged parent in one s life certainly when there aren t particular reasons against it thatthere may be others than his getting drunk is exactly the moralof what is before us in the first place mr verver isn t aged the colonel just hung fire but it came then why the deuce doeshe oh poor dear man behave as if he were she took a moment to meet it how do you know how he behaves well my own love we see how charlotte does again at this she faltered but again she rose ah isn t my whole point thathe s charming to her doesn t it depend a bit on what she regards as charming she faced the question as if it were flippant then with aheadshake of dignity she brushed it away it s mr verver who sreally young it s charlotte who s really old and what i wassaying she added isn t affected you were saying he did her the justice that they re allguileless that they were guileless all at first quite extraordinarily it s what i mean by their failure to see that the more they tookfor granted they could work together the more they were reallyworking apart for i repeat fanny went on that i reallybelieve charlotte and the prince honestly to have made up theirminds originally that their very esteem for mr verver whichwas serious as well it might be would save them i see the colonel inclined himself and save him it comes to the same thing then save maggie that comes said mrs assingham to something a littledifferent for maggie has done the most he wondered what do you call the most well she did it originally she began the vicious circle forthat though you make round eyes at my associating her with vice is simply what it has been it s their mutualconsideration all round that has made it the bottomless gulf and they re really so embroiled but because in their way they ve been so improbably good in their way yes the colonel grinned which was above all maggie s way no flicker of his ribaldrywas anything to her now maggie had in the first place to makeup to her father for her having suffered herself to become poorlittle dear as she believed so intensely married then she hadto make up to her husband for taking so much of the time theymight otherwise have spent together to make this reparation tomr verver perfect and her way to do this precisely was byallowing the prince the use the enjoyment whatever you may callit of charlotte to cheer his path by instalments as it were in proportion as she herself making sure her father was allright might be missed from his side by so much at the sametime however mrs assingham further explained by so much asshe took her young stepmother for this purpose away from mr verver by just so much did this too strike her as somethingagain to be made up for it has saddled her you will easily see with a positively new obligation to her father an obligationcreated and aggravated by her unfortunate even if quite heroic little sense of justice she began with wanting to show him thathis marriage could never under whatever temptation of her ownbliss with the prince become for her a pretext for deserting orneglecting him then that in its order entailed her wanting toshow the prince that she recognised how the other desire thiswish to remain intensely the same passionate little daughtershe had always been involved in some degree and just for thepresent so to speak her neglecting and deserting him i quitehold fanny with characteristic amplitude parenthesised that aperson can mostly feel but one passion one tender passion thatis at a time only that doesn t hold good for our primary andinstinctive attachments the voice of blood such as one sfeeling for a parent or a brother those may be intense andyet not prevent other intensities as you will recognise mydear when you remember how i continued tout betement to adoremy mother whom you didn t adore for years after i had begun toadore you well maggie she kept it up is in the samesituation as i was plus complications from which i was thankheaven exempt plus the complication above all of not havingin the least begun with the sense for complications that i shouldhave had before she knew it at any rate her little scruplesand her little lucidities which were really so divinely blind her feverish little sense of justice as i say had brought thetwo others together as her grossest misconduct couldn t havedone and now she knows something or other has happened yethasn t heretofore known what she has only piled up her remedy poor child something that she has earnestly but confusedly seenas her necessary policy piled it on top of the policy on top ofthe remedy that she at first thought out for herself and thatwould really have needed since then so much modification heronly modification has been the growth of her necessity to preventher father s wondering if all in their life in common may be socertainly for the best she has now as never before to keep himunconscious that peculiar if he makes a point of it as theirsituation is there s anything in it all uncomfortable ordisagreeable anything morally the least out of the way she hasto keep touching it up to make it each day each month looknatural and normal to him so that god forgive me thecomparison she s like an old woman who has taken to painting and who has to lay it on thicker to carry it off with a greateraudacity with a greater impudence even the older she grows and fanny stood a moment captivated with the image she had thrownoff i like the idea of maggie audacious and impudent learningto be so to gloss things over she could she even will yet ibelieve learn it for that sacred purpose consummately diabolically for from the moment the dear man should see it sall rouge she paused staring at the vision it imparted itself even to bob then the fun would begin as itbut made her look at him hard however he amended the form ofhis inquiry you mean that in that case she will charmingcreature be lost she was silent a moment more as i ve told you before she won tbe lost if her father s saved she ll see that as salvationenough the colonel took it in then she s a little heroine rather she s a little heroine but it s his innocence aboveall mrs assingham added that will pull them through her companion at this focussed again mr verver s innocence it s awfully quaint of course it s awfully quaint that it s awfully quaint thatthe pair are awfully quaint quaint with all our dear oldquaintness by which i don t mean yours and mine but that of myown sweet countrypeople from whom i ve so deplorablydegenerated that mrs assingham declared was originally thehead and front of their appeal to me and of my interest inthem and of course i shall feel them quainter still she ratherruefully subjoined before they ve done with me this might be but it wasn t what most stood in the colonel sway you believe so in mr verver s innocence after two years ofcharlotte she stared but the whole point is just that two years ofcharlotte are what he hasn t really or what you may callundividedly had any more than maggie by your theory eh has really orundividedly had four of the prince it takes all she hasn thad the colonel conceded to account for the innocence that inher too so leaves us in admiration so far as it might be ribald again she let this pass it takes agreat many things to account for maggie what is definite at allevents is that strange though this be her effort for herfather has up to now sufficiently succeeded she has made him she makes him accept the tolerably obvious oddity of theirrelation all round for part of the game behind her there protected and amused and as it were exquisitely humbugged theprincipino in whom he delights always aiding he has safely andserenely enough suffered the conditions of his life to pass forthose he had sublimely projected he hadn t worked them out indetail any more than i had heaven pity me and the queernesshas been exactly in the detail this for him is what it wasto have married charlotte and they both she neatly wound up help both i mean that if maggie always in the breach makes it seem tohim all so flourishingly to fit charlotte does her part notless and her part is very large charlotte fanny declared works like a horse so there it all was and her husband looked at her a minuteacross it and what does the prince work like she fixed him in return like a prince whereupon breakingshort off to ascend to her room she presented her highly decorated back in which in odd places controlling thecomplications of its aspect the ruby or the garnet theturquoise and the topaz gleamed like faint symbols of the witthat pinned together the satin patches of her argument he watched her as if she left him positively under the impressionof her mastery of her subject yes as if the real upshot of thedrama before them was but that he had when it came to the tightplaces of life as life had shrunk for him now the most luminousof wives he turned off in this view of her majestic retreat the comparatively faint little electric lamp which had presidedover their talk then he went up as immediately behind her as thebillows of her amber train allowed making out how all theclearness they had conquered was even for herself a relief howat last the sense of the amplitude of her exposition sustainedand floated her joining her however on the landing above where she had already touched a metallic point into light hefound she had done perhaps even more to create than to extinguishin him the germ of a curiosity he held her a minute longer there was another plum in the pie what did you mean someminutes ago by his not caring for charlotte the prince s by his not really caring she recalled after alittle benevolently enough i mean that men don t when it hasall been too easy that s how in nine cases out of ten a womanis treated who has risked her life you asked me just now how heworks she added but you might better perhaps have asked mehow he plays well he made it up like a prince like a prince he is profoundly a prince for that she saidwith expression he s beautifully a case they re far rarer even in the highest circles than they pretend to be andthat s what makes so much of his value he s perhaps one of thevery last the last of the real ones so it is we must take him we must take him all round the colonel considered and how must charlotte if anythinghappens take him the question held her a minute and while she waited with hereyes on him she put out a grasping hand to his arm in the fleshof which he felt her answer distinctly enough registered thusshe gave him standing off a little the firmest longest deepest injunction he had ever received from her nothing in spite of everything will happen nothing has happened nothing is happening he looked a trifle disappointed i see for us for us for whom else and he was to feel indeed how she wishedhim to understand it we know nothing on earth it was anundertaking he must sign so he wrote as it were his name we know nothing on earth itwas like the soldiers watchword at night we re as innocent she went on in the same way as babes why not rather say he asked as innocent as they themselvesare oh for the best of reasons because we re much more so he wondered but how can we be more for them oh easily we can be anything absolute idiots then absolute idiots and oh fanny breathed the way it will restus well he looked as if there were something in that but won tthey know we re not she barely hesitated charlotte and the prince think we are which is so much gained mr verver believes in ourintelligence but he doesn t matter and maggie doesn t she know that we see before our noses yes this indeed took longer oh so far as she may guess it she ll give no sign so it comesto the same thing he raised his eyebrows comes to our not being able to helpher that s the way we shall help her by looking like fools she threw up her hands she only wants herself to look like abigger so there we are with which she brushed it away hisconformity was promised something however still held her itbroke to her own vision as a last wave of clearness moreover now she said i see i mean she added what youwere asking me how i knew to day in eaton square that maggie sawake and she had indeed visibly got it it was by seeing themtogether seeing her with her father he fell behind again but you veseen her often enough before never with my present eyes for nothing like such a test thatof this length of the others absence together has hithertooccurred possibly but if she and mr verver insisted upon it why is it such a test because it has become one without theirintending it it has spoiled so to speak on their hands it has soured eh the colonel said the word s horrible say rather it has changed perhaps fanny went on she did wish to see how much she can bear inthat case she has seen only it was she alone who about thevisit insisted her father insists on nothing and she watcheshim do it her husband looked impressed watches him for the first faint sign i mean of his noticing it doesn t asi tell you come but she s there for it to see and i felt shecontinued how she s there i caught her as it were in thefact she couldn t keep it from me though she left her post onpurpose came home with me to throw dust in my eyes i took itall her dust but it was what showed me with which supremelucidity she reached the door of her room luckily it showed mealso how she has succeeded nothing from him has come you re so awfully sure sure nothing will good night she said she ll die first the golden bowl volume iibook second the princesspart fourthxxvit was not till many days had passed that the princess began toaccept the idea of having done a little something she was notalways doing or indeed that of having listened to any inwardvoice that spoke in a new tone yet these instinctivepostponements of reflection were the fruit positively ofrecognitions and perceptions already active of the sense aboveall that she had made at a particular hour made by the meretouch of her hand a difference in the situation so long presentto her as practically unattackable this situation had beenoccupying for months and months the very centre of the gardenof her life but it had reared itself there like some strange tall tower of ivory or perhaps rather some wonderful beautiful but outlandish pagoda a structure plated with hard brightporcelain coloured and figured and adorned at the overhangingeaves with silver bells that tinkled ever so charmingly whenstirred by chance airs she had walked round and round it thatwas what she felt she had carried on her existence in the spaceleft her for circulation a space that sometimes seemed ample andsometimes narrow looking up all the while at the fairstructure that spread itself so amply and rose so high but neverquite making out as yet where she might have entered had shewished she had not wished till now such was the odd case andwhat was doubtless equally odd besides was that though herraised eyes seemed to distinguish places that must serve fromwithin and especially far aloft as apertures and outlooks nodoor appeared to give access from her convenient garden level the great decorated surface had remained consistentlyimpenetrable and inscrutable at present however to herconsidering mind it was as if she had ceased merely to circleand to scan the elevation ceased so vaguely so quite helplesslyto stare and wonder she had caught herself distinctly in the actof pausing then in that of lingering and finally in that ofstepping unprecedentedly near the thing might have been by thedistance at which it kept her a mahometan mosque with which nobase heretic could take a liberty there so hung about it thevision of one s putting off one s shoes to enter and even verily of one s paying with one s life if found there as aninterloper she had not certainly arrived at the conception ofpaying with her life for anything she might do but it wasnevertheless quite as if she had sounded with a tap or two one ofthe rare porcelain plates she had knocked in short though shecould scarce have said whether for admission or for what she hadapplied her hand to a cool smooth spot and had waited to see whatwould happen something had happened it was as if a sound ather touch after a little had come back to her from within asound sufficiently suggesting that her approach had been noted if this image however may represent our young woman sconsciousness of a recent change in her life a change now but afew days old it must at the same time be observed that she bothsought and found in renewed circulation as i have called it ameasure of relief from the idea of having perhaps to answer forwhat she had done the pagoda in her blooming garden figured thearrangement how otherwise was it to be named by which sostrikingly she had been able to marry without breaking as sheliked to put it with the past she had surrendered herself toher husband without the shadow of a reserve or a condition andyet she had not all the while given up her father the leastlittle inch she had compassed the high city of seeing the twomen beautifully take to each other and nothing in her marriagehad marked it as more happy than this fact of its havingpractically given the elder the lonelier a new friend what hadmoreover all the while enriched the whole aspect of success wasthat the latter s marriage had been no more meassurably paid forthan her own his having taken the same great step in the samefree way had not in the least

notenamoured of flights of brilliancy of audacity of originality that speaking at least for the dear man and herself were not atall in their line but they liked to think they had given theirlife this unusual extension and this liberal form which manyfamilies many couples and still more many pairs of couples would not have found workable that last truth had beendistinctly brought home to them by the bright testimony thequite explicit envy of most of their friends who had remarkedto them again and again that they must on all the showing tokeep on such terms be people of the highest amiability equallyincluding in the praise of course amerigo and charlotte it hadgiven them pleasure as how should it not to find themselvesshed such a glamour it had certainly that is given pleasure toher father and herself both of them distinguishably of a natureso slow to presume that they would scarce have been sure of theirtriumph without this pretty reflection of it so it was thattheir felicity had fructified so it was that the ivory tower visible and admirable doubtless from any point of the socialfield had risen stage by stage maggie s actual reluctance toask herself with proportionate sharpness why she had ceased totake comfort in the sight of it represented accordingly a lapsefrom that ideal consistency on which her moral comfort almost atany time depended to remain consistent she had always beencapable of cutting down more or less her prior term moving for the first time in her life as in the darkening shadowof a false position she reflected that she should either nothave ceased to be right that is to be confident or haverecognised that she was wrong though she tried to deal withherself for a space only as a silken coated spaniel who hasscrambled out of a pond and who rattles the water from his ears her shake of her head again and again as she went was much ofthat order and she had the resource to which save for the rudeequivalent of his generalising bark the spaniel would have beena stranger of humming to herself hard as a sign that nothing hadhappened to her she had not so to speak fallen in she had hadno accident and had not got wet this at any rate was herpretension until after she began a little to wonder if shemightn t with or without exposure have taken cold she could atall events remember no time at which she had felt so excited andcertainly none which was another special point that so broughtwith it as well the necessity for concealing excitement thisbirth of a new eagerness became a high pastime in her view precisely by reason of the ingenuity required for keeping thething born out of sight the ingenuity was thus a private andabsorbing exercise in the light of which might i so farmultiply my metaphors i should compare her to the frightened butclinging young mother of an unlawful child the idea that hadpossession of her would be by our new analogy the proof of hermisadventure but likewise all the while only another sign of arelation that was more to her than anything on earth she hadlived long enough to make out for herself that any deep seatedpassion has its pangs as well as its joys and that we are madeby its aches and its anxieties most richly conscious of it shehad never doubted of the force of the feeling that bound her toher husband but to become aware almost suddenly that it hadbegun to vibrate with a violence that had some of the effect of astrain would rightly looked at after all but show that she was like thousands of women every day acting up to the fullprivilege of passion why in the world shouldn t she with everyright if on consideration she saw no good reason against it the best reason against it would have been the possibility ofsome consequence disagreeable or inconvenient to others especially to such others as had never incommoded her by theegotism of their passions but if once that danger were dulyguarded against the fulness of one s measure amounted to no morethan the equal use of one s faculties or the proper playing ofone s part it had come to the princess obscurely at first butlittle by little more conceivably that her faculties had not fora good while been concomitantly used the case resembled in amanner that of her once loved dancing a matter of rememberedsteps that had grown vague from her ceasing to go to balls shewould go to balls again that seemed freely even crudely stated the remedy she would take out of the deep receptacles inwhich she had laid them away the various ornamentscongruous with the greater occasions and of which her store sheliked to think was none of the smallest she would have beeneasily to be figured for us at this occupation dipping at offmoments and quiet hours in snatched visits and by draughtycandle light into her rich collections and seeing her jewelsagain a little shyly but all unmistakably glow that in factmay pass as the very picture of her semi smothered agitation ofthe diversion she to some extent successfully found in referringher crisis so far as was possible to the mere working of herown needs it must be added however that she would have been at a loss todetermine and certainly at first to which order that ofself control or that of large expression the step she had takenthe afternoon of her husband s return from matcham with hiscompanion properly belonged for it had been a step distinctly on maggie s part her deciding to do something just then andthere which would strike amerigo as unusual and this eventhough her departure from custom had merely consisted in her soarranging that he wouldn t find her as he would definitelyexpect to do in eaton square he would have strangely enough as might seem to him to come back home for it and there get theimpression of her rather pointedly or at least all impatientlyand independently awaiting him these were small variations andmild manoeuvres but they went accompanied on maggie s part aswe have mentioned with an infinite sense of intention herwatching by his fireside for her husband s return from an absencemight superficially have presented itself as the most natural actin the world and the only one into the bargain on which hewould positively have reckoned it fell by this circumstance intothe order of plain matters and yet the very aspect by which itwas in the event handed over to her brooding fancy was the factthat she had done with it all she had designed she had put herthought to the proof and the proof had shown its edge this waswhat was before her that she was no longer playing with bluntand idle tools with weapons that didn t cut there passed acrossher vision ten times a day the gleam of a bare blade and at thisit was that she most shut her eyes most knew the impulse tocheat herself with motion and sound she had merely driven on acertain wednesday to portland place instead of remaining ineaton square and she privately repeated it again and again there had appeared beforehand no reason why she should have seenthe mantle of history flung by a single sharp sweep over socommonplace a deed that all the same was what had happened ithad been bitten into her mind all in an hour that nothing shehad ever done would hereafter in some way yet to be determined so count for her perhaps not even what she had done inaccepting in their old golden rome amerigo s proposal ofmarriage and yet by her little crouching posture there that ofa timid tigress she had meant nothing recklessly ultimate nothing clumsily fundamental so that she called it names theinvidious the grotesque attitude holding it up to her ownridicule reducing so far as she could the portee of what hadfollowed it she had but wanted to get nearer nearer tosomething indeed that she couldn t that she wouldn t even toherself describe and the degree of this achieved nearness waswhat had been in advance incalculable her actual multiplicationof distractions and suppressions whatever it did for her failedto prevent her living over again any chosen minute for she couldchoose them she could fix them of the freshness of relationproduced by her having administered to her husband the firstsurprise to which she had ever treated him it had been a poorthing but it had been all her own and the whole passage wasbackwardly there a great picture hung on the wall of her dailylife for her to make what she would of it fell for retrospect into a succession of moments that werewatchable still almost in the manner of the different thingsdone during a scene on the stage some scene so acted as to haveleft a great impression on the tenant of one of the stalls several of these moments stood out beyond the others and thoseshe could feel again most count again like the firm pearls on astring had belonged more particularly to the lapse of timebefore dinner dinner which had been so late quite at nineo clock that evening thanks to the final lateness of amerigo sown advent these were parts of the experience though in factthere had been a good many of them between which her impressioncould continue sharply to discriminate before the subsequentpassages much later on it was to be said the flame of memoryturned to an equalising glow that of a lamp in some side chapelin which incense was thick the great moment at any rate forconscious repossession was doubtless the first the strangelittle timed silence which she had fully gauged on the spot asaltogether beyond her own intention but which for just howlong should she ever really know for just how long she coulddo nothing to break she was in the smaller drawing room inwhich she always sat and she had by calculation dressed fordinner on finally coming in it was a wonder how many things shehad calculated in respect to this small incident a matter forthe importance of which she had so quite indefinite a measure hewould be late he would be very late that was the one certaintythat seemed to look her in the face there was still also thepossibility that if he drove with charlotte straight to eatonsquare he might think it best to remain there even on learningshe had come away she had left no message for him on any suchchance this was another of her small shades of decision thoughthe effect of it might be to keep him still longer absent hemight suppose she would already have dined he might stay withall he would have to tell just on purpose to be nice to herfather she had known him to stretch the point to thesebeautiful ends far beyond that he had more than once stretchedit to the sacrifice of the opportunity of dressing if she herself had now avoided any such sacrifice and had madeherself during the time at her disposal quite inordinatelyfresh and quite positively smart this had probably added whileshe waited and waited to that very tension of spirit in whichshe was afterwards to find the image of her having crouched shedid her best quite intensely by herself to banish any suchappearance she couldn t help it if she couldn t read her palenovel ah that par exemple was beyond her but she could atleast sit by the lamp with the book sit there with her newestfrock worn for the first time sticking out all round her quite stiff and grand even perhaps a little too stiff and toogrand for a familiar and domestic frock yet marked none theless this time she ventured to hope by incontestable intrinsicmerit she had glanced repeatedly at the clock but she hadrefused herself the weak indulgence of walking up and down though the act of doing so she knew would make her feel on thepolished floor with the rustle and the hang still morebeautifully bedecked the difficulty was that it would also makeher feel herself still more sharply in a state which was exactlywhat she proposed not to do the only drops of her anxiety hadbeen when her thought strayed complacently with her eyes to thefront of her gown which was in a manner a refuge a beguilement especially when she was able to fix it long enough to wonder ifit would at last really satisfy charlotte she had ever been inrespect to her clothes rather timorous and uncertain for thelast year above all she had lived in the light of charlotte spossible and rather inscrutable judgment of them charlotte s ownwere simply the most charming and interesting that any woman hadever put on there was a kind of poetic justice in her being atlast able in this particular thanks to means thanks quite toomnipotence freely to exercise her genius but maggie would havedescribed herself as in these connections constantly andintimately torn conscious on one side of the impossibility ofcopying her companion and conscious on the other of theimpossibility of sounding her independently to the bottom yes it was one of the things she should go down to her grave withouthaving known how charlotte after all had been said reallythought her stepdaughter looked under any supposedly ingeniouspersonal experiment she had always been lovely about thestepdaughter s material braveries had done for her the verybest with them but there had ever fitfully danced at the back ofmaggie s head the suspicion that these expressions were mercies not judgments embodying no absolute but only a relative frankness hadn t charlotte with so perfect a critical vision if the truth were known given her up as hopeless hopeless by aserious standard and thereby invented for her a different andinferior one in which as the only thing to be done shepatiently and soothingly abetted her hadn t she in other words assented in secret despair perhaps even in secret irritation toher being ridiculous so that the best now possible was towonder once in a great while whether one mightn t give her thesurprise of something a little less out of the true note thanusual something of this kind was the question that maggie whilethe absentees still delayed asked of the appearance she wasendeavouring to present but with the result repeatedly again that it only went and lost itself in the thick air that had begunmore and more to hang for our young woman over heraccumulations of the unanswered they were there theseaccumulations they were like a roomful of confused objects never as yet sorted which for some time now she had beenpassing and re passing along the corridor of her life shepassed it when she could without opening the door then onoccasion she turned the key to throw in a fresh contribution soit was that she had been getting things out of the way theyrejoined the rest of the confusion it was as if they found theirplace by some instinct of affinity in the heap they knew inshort where to go and when she at present by a mental act once more pushed the door open she had practically a sense ofmethod and experience what she should never know aboutcharlotte s thought she tossed that in it would find itself incompany and she might at last have been standing there longenough to see it fall into its corner the sight moreover woulddoubtless have made her stare had her attention been more free the sight of the mass of vain things congruous incongruous that awaited every addition it made her in fact with a vaguegasp turn away and what had further determined this was thefinal sharp extinction of the inward scene by the outward thequite different door had opened and her husband was there it had been as strange as she could consent afterwards to thinkit it had been essentially what had made the abrupt bend inher life he had come back had followed her from the otherhouse visibly uncertain this was written in the face he for thefirst minute showed her it had been written only for thoseseconds and it had appeared to go quickly after theybegan to talk but while it lasted it had been written large and though she didn t quite know what she had expected of him she felt she hadn t expected the least shade of embarrassment what had made the embarrassment she called it embarrassment soas to be able to assure herself she put it at the very worst what had made the particular look was his thus distinguishablywishing to see how he should find her why first that had lateron kept coming to her the question dangled there as if it werethe key to everything with the sense of it on the spot she hadfelt overwhelmingly that she was significant that so she mustinstantly strike him and that this had a kind of violence beyondwhat she had intended it was in fact even at the moment notabsent from her view that he might easily have made an abjectfool of her at least for the time she had indeed for just tenseconds been afraid of some such turn the uncertainty in hisface had become so the next thing an uncertainty in the veryair three words of impatience the least bit loud some outbreakof what in the world are you up to and what do you mean anynote of that sort would instantly have brought her low and thisall the more that heaven knew she hadn t in any manner designedto be high it was such a trifle her small breach with custom or at any rate with his natural presumption that all magnitudeof wonder had already had before one could deprecate the shadowof it the effect of a complication it had made for him somedifference that she couldn t measure this meeting him at homeand alone instead of elsewhere and with others and backand back it kept coming to her that the blankness he showed herbefore he was able to see might should she choose to insist onit have a meaning have as who should say an historic value beyond the importance of momentary expressions in general shehad naturally had on the spot no ready notion of what he mightwant to see it was enough for a ready notion not to speak of abeating heart that he did see that he saw his wife in her owndrawing room at the hour when she would most properly be there he hadn t in any way challenged her it was true and afterthose instants during which she now believed him to have beenharbouring the impression of something unusually prepared andpointed in her attitude and array he had advanced upon hersmiling and smiling and thus without hesitation at the last had taken her into his arms the hesitation had been at thefirst and she at present saw that he had surmounted it withouther help she had given him no help for if on the one hand shecouldn t speak for hesitation so on the other and especially ashe didn t ask her she couldn t explain why she was agitated shehad known it all the while down to her toes known it in hispresence with fresh intensity and if he had uttered but aquestion it would have pressed in her the spring of recklessness it had been strange that the most natural thing of all to say tohim should have had that appearance but she was more than everconscious that any appearance she had would come round more orless straight to her father whose life was now so quiet on thebasis accepted for it that any alteration of his consciousnesseven in the possible sense of enlivenment would make theirprecious equilibrium waver that was at the bottom of her mind that their equilibrium was everything and that it waspractically precarious a matter of a hair s breadth for the lossof the balance it was the equilibrium or at all events herconscious fear about it that had brought her heart into hermouth and the same fear was on either side in the silent lookshe and amerigo had exchanged the happy balance that demandedthis amount of consideration was truly thus as by its ownconfession a delicate matter but that her husband had also hishabit of anxiety and his general caution only brought them afterall more closely together it would have been most beautifully therefore in the name of the equilibrium and in that of her joyat their feeling so exactly the same about it that she mighthave spoken if she had permitted the truth on the subject of herbehaviour to ring out on the subject of that poor littlebehaviour which was for the moment so very limited a case ofeccentricity why why have i made this evening such a point of our not alldining together well because i ve all day been so wanting youalone that i finally couldn t bear it and that there didn t seemany great reason why i should try to that came to me funny asit may at first sound with all the things we ve so wonderfullygot into the way of bearing for each other you ve seemed theselast days i don t know what more absent than ever before tooabsent for us merely to go on so it s all very well and iperfectly see how beautiful it is all round but there comes aday when something snaps when the full cup filled to the verybrim begins to flow over that s what has happened to my need ofyou the cup all day has been too full to carry so here i amwith it spilling it over you and just for the reason that isthe reason of my life after all i ve scarcely to explain thati m as much in love with you now as the first hour except thatthere are some hours which i know when they come because theyalmost frighten me that show me i m even more so they come ofthemselves and ah they ve been coming after all afterall some such words as those were what didn t ring out yetit was as if even the unuttered sound had been quenched here inits own quaver it was where utterance would have broken down byits very weight if he had let it get so far without thatextremity at the end of a moment he had taken in what he neededto take that his wife was testifying that she adored and missedand desired him after all after all since she put it so shewas right that was what he had to respond to that was what from the moment that as has been said he saw he had to treatas the most pertinent thing possible he held her close and long in expression of their personal reunion this obviously was oneway of doing so he rubbed his cheek tenderly and with a deepvague murmur against her face that side of her face she was notpressing to his breast that was not less obviously anotherway and there were ways enough in short for his extemporisedease for the good humour she was afterwards to find herselfthinking of as his infinite tact this last was partly no doubt because the question of tact might be felt as having come up atthe end of a quarter of an hour during which he had liberallytalked and she had genially questioned he had told her of hisday the happy thought of his roundabout journey with charlotte all their cathedral hunting adventure and how it had turned outrather more of an affair than they expected the moral of it was at any rate that he was tired verily and must have a bath anddress to which end she would kindly excuse him for the shortesttime possible she was to remember afterwards something that hadpassed between them on this how he had looked for her duringan instant at the door before going out how he had met herasking him in hesitation first then quickly in decision whether she couldn t help him by going up with him he hadperhaps also for a moment hesitated but he had declined heroffer and she was to preserve as i say the memory of the smilewith which he had opined that at that rate they wouldn t dinetill ten o clock and that he should go straighter and fasteralone such things as i say were to come back to her theyplayed through her full after sense like lights on the wholeimpression the subsequent parts of the experience were not tohave blurred their distinctness one of these subsequent parts the first had been the not inconsiderable length to her laterand more analytic consciousness of this second wait for herhusband s reappearance she might certainly with the best willin the world had she gone up with him have been more in his waythan not since people could really almost always hurry betterwithout help than with it still she could actually hardly havemade him take more time than he struck her taking though it mustindeed be added that there was now in this much thinking littleperson s state of mind no mere crudity of impatience somethinghad happened rapidly with the beautiful sight of him and withthe drop of her fear of having annoyed him by making him go toand fro subsidence of the fearsome for maggie s spirit wasalways at first positive emergence of the sweet and it waslong since anything had been so sweet to her as the particularquality suddenly given by her present emotion to the sense ofpossession xxviamerigo was away from her again as she sat there as she walkedthere without him for she had with the difference of hispresence in the house ceased to keep herself from moving about but the hour was filled nevertheless with the effect of hisnearness and above all with the effect strange in an intimacyso established of an almost renewed vision of the facts of hisaspect she had seen him last but five days since yet he hadstood there before her as if restored from some far country somelong voyage some combination of dangers or fatigues thisunquenchable variety in his appeal to her interest what did itmean but that reduced to the flatness of mere statement she wasmarried by good fortune to an altogether dazzling person thatwas an old old story but the truth of it shone out to her likethe beauty of some family picture some mellow portrait of anancestor that she might have been looking at almost insurprise after a long intermission the dazzling person wasupstairs and she was down and there were moreover the otherfacts of the selection and decision that this demonstration ofher own had required and of the constant care that theequilibrium involved but she had all the same never felt soabsorbingly married so abjectly conscious of a master of herfate he could do what he would with her in fact what wasactually happening was that he was actually doing it what hewould what he really would only that quantity itself escapedperhaps in the brightness of the high harmony familiar namingand discussing it was enough of a recognition for her that whatever the thing he might desire he would always absolutelybring it off she knew at this moment without a question withthe fullest surrender how he had brought off in her by scarcemore than a single allusion a perfect flutter of tenderness ifhe had come back tired tired from his long day the exertion hadbeen literally in her service and her father s they two hadsat at home at peace the principino between them thecomplications of life kept down the bores sifted out the largeease of the home preserved because of the way the others heldthe field and braved the weather amerigo never complained anymore than for that matter charlotte did but she seemed to seeto night as she had never yet quite done that their business ofsocial representation conceived as they conceived it beyond anyconception of her own and conscientiously carried out was anaffair of living always in harness she remembered fannyassingham s old judgment that friend s description of her fatherand herself as not living at all as not knowing what to do orwhat might be done for them and there came back to her with itan echo of the long talk they had had together one september dayat fawns under the trees when she put before him this dictum offanny s that occasion might have counted for them she had already oftenmade the reflection as the first step in an existence moreintelligently arranged it had been an hour from which the chainof causes and consequences was definitely traceable so manythings and at the head of the list her father s marriage havingappeared to her to flow from charlotte s visit to fawns and thatevent itself having flowed from the memorable talk but whatperhaps most came out in the light of these concatenations wasthat it had been for all the world as if charlotte had been had in as the servants always said of extra help because theyhad thus suffered it to be pointed out to them that if theirfamily coach lumbered and stuck the fault was in its lacking itscomplement of wheels having but three as they might say it hadwanted another and what had charlotte done from the first butbegin to act on the spot and ever so smoothly and beautifully as a fourth nothing had been immediately more manifest thanthe greater grace of the movement of the vehicle as to which for the completeness of her image maggie was now supremely tofeel how every strain had been lightened for herself so far asshe was one of the wheels she had but to keep in her place sincethe work was done for her she felt no weight and it wasn t toomuch to acknowledge that she had scarce to turn round she had along pause before the fire during which she might have beenfixing with intensity her projected vision have been consciouseven of its taking an absurd fantastic shape she might havebeen watching the family coach pass and noting that somehow amerigo and charlotte were pulling it while she and her fatherwere not so much as pushing they were seated inside together dandling the principino and holding him up to the windows to seeand be seen like an infant positively royal so that theexertion was all with the others maggie found in this image arepeated challenge again and yet again she paused before thefire after which each time in the manner of one for whom astrong light has suddenly broken she gave herself to liveliermovement she had seen herself at last in the picture she wasstudying suddenly jump from the coach whereupon frankly withthe wonder of the sight her eyes opened wider and her heartstood still for a moment she looked at the person so acting asif this person were somebody else waiting with intensity to seewhat would follow the person had taken a decision which wasevidently because an impulse long gathering had at last felt asharpest pressure only how was the decision to be applied what in particular would the figure in the picture do shelooked about her from the middle of the room under the force ofthis question as if there exactly were the field of actioninvolved then as the door opened again she recognised whatever the action the form at any rate of a firstopportunity her husband had reappeared he stood before herrefreshed almost radiant quite reassuring dressed anointed fragrant ready above all for his dinner he smiled at her overthe end of their delay it was as if her opportunity had dependedon his look and now she saw that it was good there was still for the instant something in suspense but it passed morequickly than on his previous entrance he was already holding outhis arms it was for hours and hours later on as if she hadsomehow been lifted aloft were floated and carried on some warmhigh tide beneath which stumbling blocks had sunk out of sight this came from her being again for the time in the enjoyment ofconfidence from her knowing as she believed what to do allthe next day and all the next she appeared to herself to knowit she had a plan and she rejoiced in her plan this consistedof the light that suddenly breaking into her restless reverie had marked the climax of that vigil it had come to her as aquestion what if i ve abandoned them you know what if i veaccepted too passively the funny form of our life there wouldbe a process of her own by which she might do differently inrespect to amerigo and charlotte a process quite independent ofany process of theirs such a solution had but to rise before herto affect her to charm her with its simplicity an advantageoussimplicity she had been stupid for so long not to have beenstruck by and the simplicity meanwhile seemed proved by thesuccess that had already begun to attend her she had only hadherself to do something to see how immediately it answered thisconsciousness of its having answered with her husband was theuplifting sustaining wave he had met her she so put it toherself met her with an effect of generosity and of gaiety inespecial on his coming back to her ready for dinner which shewore in her breast as the token of an escape for them both fromsomething not quite definite but clearly much less good evenat that moment in fact her plan had begun to work she hadbeen when he brightly reappeared in the act of plucking it outof the heart of her earnestness plucking it in the garden ofthought as if it had been some full blown flower that she couldpresent to him on the spot well it was the flower ofparticipation and as that then and there she held it out tohim putting straightway into execution the idea so needlessly so absurdly obscured of her sharing with him whatever theenjoyment the interest the experience might be and sharingalso for that matter with charlotte she had thrown herself at dinner into every feature of therecent adventure of the companions letting him see withoutreserve that she wished to hear everything about it and makingcharlotte in particular charlotte s judgment of matcham charlotte s aspect her success there her effect traceablyproduced her clothes inimitably worn her cleverness gracefullydisplayed her social utility in fine brilliantly exemplified the subject of endless inquiry maggie s inquiry was mostempathetic moreover for the whole happy thought of thecathedral hunt which she was so glad they had entertained andas to the pleasant results of which down to the cold beef andbread and cheese the queer old smell and the dirty table clothat the inn amerigo was good humouredly responsive he had lookedat her across the table more than once as if touched by thehumility of this welcome offered to impressions at second hand the amusements the large freedoms only of others as ifrecognising in it something fairly exquisite and at the end while they were alone before she had rung for a servant he hadrenewed again his condonation of the little irregularity such asit was on which she had ventured they had risen together tocome upstairs he had been talking at the last about some of thepeople at the very last of all about lady castledean and mr blint after which she had once more broken ground on the matterof the type of gloucester it brought her as he came round thetable to join her yet another of his kind conscious stares oneof the looks visibly beguiled but at the same time notinvisibly puzzled with which he had already shown his sense ofthis charming grace of her curiosity it was as if he might for amoment be going to say you needn t pretend dearest quite sohard needn t think it necessary to care quite so much it wasas if he stood there before her with some such easy intelligence some such intimate reassurance on his lips her answer wouldhave been all ready that she wasn t in the least pretending andshe looked up at him while he took her hand with themaintenance the real persistence of her lucid little planin her eyes she wanted him to understand from that very momentthat she was going to be with him again quite with them together as she doubtless hadn t been since the funny changes that was really all one could call them into which theyhad each as for the sake of the others too easily and tooobligingly slipped they had taken too much for granted thattheir life together required as people in london said a special form which was very well so long as the form was kept only forthe outside world and was made no more of among themselves thanthe pretty mould of an iced pudding or something of that sort into which to help yourself you didn t hesitate to break withthe spoon so much as that she would with an opening haveallowed herself furthermore to observe she wanted him tounderstand how her scheme embraced charlotte too so that if hehad but uttered the acknowledgment she judged him on the point ofmaking the acknowledgment of his catching at her brave littleidea for their case she would have found herself as distinctly voluble almost to eloquence what befell however was that even while she thus waited shefelt herself present at a process taking place rather deeperwithin him than the occasion on the whole appeared to require a process of weighing something in the balance of considering deciding dismissing he had guessed that she was there with anidea there in fact by reason of her idea only this oddlyenough was what at the last stayed his words she was helped tothese perceptions by his now looking at her still harder than hehad yet done which really brought it to the turn of a hair forher that she didn t make sure his notion of her idea was theright one it was the turn of a hair because he had possessionof her hands and was bending toward her ever so kindly as if tosee to understand more or possibly give more she didn t knowwhich and that had the effect of simply putting her as shewould have said in his power she gave up let her idea go leteverything go her one consciousness was that he was taking heragain into his arms it was not till afterwards that shediscriminated as to this felt how the act operated with himinstead of the words he hadn t uttered operated in his view asprobably better than any words as always better in fact at anytime than anything her acceptance of it her response to it inevitable foredoomed came back to her later on as a virtualassent to the assumption he had thus made that there was reallynothing such a demonstration didn t anticipate and didn t disposeof and that the spring acting within herself moreover might wellhave been beyond any other the impulse legitimately to provokeit it made for any issue the third time since his return thathe had drawn her to his breast and at present holding her tohis side as they left the room he kept her close for theirmoving into the hall and across it kept her for their slowreturn together to the apartments above he had been right overwhelmingly right as to the felicity of his tenderness andthe degree of her sensibility but even while she felt thesethings sweep all others away she tasted of a sort of terror ofthe weakness they produced in her it was still for her thatshe had positively something to do and that she mustn t be weakfor this must much rather be strong for many hours after nonethe less she remained weak if weak it was though holding fastindeed to the theory of her success since her agitated overturehad been after all so unmistakably met she recovered soon enough on the whole the sense that this lefther charlotte always to deal with charlotte who at any rate however she might meet overtures must meet them at the worst more or less differently of that inevitability of such otherranges of response as were open to charlotte maggie took themeasure in approaching her on the morrow of her return frommatcham with the same show of desire to hear all her story shewanted the whole picture from her as she had wanted it from hercompanion and promptly in eaton square whither without theprince she repaired almost ostentatiously for the purpose this purpose only she brought her repeatedly back to thesubject both in her husband s presence and during several scrapsof independent colloquy before her father instinctively maggietook the ground that his wish for interesting echoes would be notless than her own allowing that is for everything his wifewould already have had to tell him for such passages betweenthem as might have occurred since the evening before joiningthem after luncheon reaching them in her desire to proceed withthe application of her idea before they had quitted thebreakfast room the scene of their mid day meal she referred inher parent s presence to what she might have lost by delay andexpressed the hope that there would be an anecdote or two leftfor her to pick up charlotte was dressed to go out and herhusband it appeared rather positively prepared not to he hadleft the table but was seated near the fire with two or three ofthe morning papers and the residuum of the second and third postson a stand beside him more even than the usual extravagance asmaggie s glance made out of circulars catalogues advertisements announcements of sales foreign envelopes andforeign handwritings that were as unmistakable as foreignclothes charlotte at the window looking into the side streetthat abutted on the square might have been watching for theirvisitor s advent before withdrawing and in the light strangeand coloured like that of a painted picture which fixed theimpression for her objects took on values not hitherto so fullyshown it was the effect of her quickened sensibility she knewherself again in presence of a problem in need of a solution forwhich she must intensely work that consciousness lately born inher had been taught the evening before to accept a temporarylapse but had quickly enough again with her getting out of herown house and her walking across half the town for she had comefrom portland place on foot found breath still in its lungs it exhaled this breath in a sigh faint and unheard her tribute while she stood there before speaking to realities loomingthrough the golden mist that had already begun to be scattered the conditions facing her had yielded for the time to thegolden mist had considerably melted away but there they wereagain definite and it was for the next quarter of an hour as ifshe could have counted them one by one on her fingers sharp toher above all was the renewed attestation of her father scomprehensive acceptances which she had so long regarded as ofthe same quality with her own but which so distinctly now sheshould have the complication of being obliged to deal withseparately they had not yet struck her as absolutelyextraordinary which had made for her lumping them with her own since her view of her own had but so lately begun to change though it instantly stood out for her that there was really nonew judgment of them she should be able to show withoutattracting in some degree his attention without perhaps excitinghis surprise and making thereby for the situation she sharedwith him some difference she was reminded and warned by theconcrete image and for a minute charlotte s face immediatelypresented to her affected her as searching her own to see thereminder tell she had not less promptly kissed her stepmother and then had bent over her father from behind and laid hercheek upon him little amenities tantamount heretofore to an easychange of guard charlotte s own frequent though alwayscheerful term of comparison for this process of transfer maggiefigured thus as the relieving sentry and so smoothly did use andcustom work for them that her mate might even on this occasion after acceptance of the pass word have departed withoutirrelevant and in strictness unsoldierly gossip this was not none the less what happened inasmuch as if our young woman hadbeen floated over her first impulse to break the existing charmat a stroke it yet took her but an instant to sound at anyrisk the note she had been privately practising if she hadpractised it the day before at dinner on amerigo she knew butthe better how to begin for it with mrs verver and it immenselyhelped her for that matter to be able at once to speak of theprince as having done more to quicken than to soothe hercuriosity frankly and gaily she had come to ask to ask what intheir unusually prolonged campaign the two had achieved she hadgot out of her husband she admitted what she could buthusbands were never the persons who answered such questionsideally he had only made her more curious and she had arrivedearly this way in order to miss as little as possible ofcharlotte s story wives papa she said are always much better reporters though i grant she added for charlotte that fathers are notmuch better than husbands he never she smiled tells me morethan a tenth of what you tell him so i hope you haven t told himeverything yet since in that case i shall probably have lost thebest part of it maggie went she went she felt herself going she reminded herself of an actress who had been studying a partand rehearsing it but who suddenly on the stage before thefootlights had begun to improvise to speak lines not in thetext it was this very sense of the stage and the footlights thatkept her up made her rise higher just as it was the sense ofaction that logically involved some platform action quitepositively for the first time in her life or counting in theprevious afternoon for the second the platform remained forthree or four days thus sensibly under her feet and she had allthe while with it the inspiration of quite remarkably of quiteheroically improvising preparation and practice had come but ashort way her part opened out and she invented from moment tomoment what to say and to do she had but one rule of art tokeep within bounds and not lose her head certainly she might seefor a week how far that would take her she said to herself inher excitement that it was perfectly simple to bring about adifference touch by touch without letting either of the three and least of all her father so much as suspect her hand if theyshould suspect they would want a reason and the humiliatingtruth was that she wasn t ready with a reason not that is withwhat she would have called a reasonable one she thought ofherself instinctively beautifully as having dealt all herlife at her father s side and by his example only in reasonablereasons and what she would really have been most ashamed ofwould be to produce for him in this line some inferiorsubstitute unless she were in a position to plead definitely that she was jealous she should be in no position to plead decently that she was dissatisfied this latter condition wouldbe a necessary implication of the former without the formerbehind it it would have to fall to the ground so had the case wonderfully been arranged for her there was a card she couldplay but there was only one and to play it would be to end thegame she felt herself as at the small square green table between the tall old silver candlesticks and the neatly arrangedcounters her father s playmate and partner and what itconstantly came back to in her mind was that for her to ask aquestion to raise a doubt to reflect in any degree on the playof the others would be to break the charm the charm she had tocall it since it kept her companion so constantly engaged so perpetually seated and so contentedly occupied to sayanything at all would be in fine to have to say why she wasjealous and she could in her private hours but stare long with suffused eyes at that impossibility by the end of a week the week that had begun especially withher morning hour in eaton square between her father and hiswife her consciousness of being beautifully treated had becomeagain verily greater than her consciousness of anything else andi must add moreover that she at last found herself rather oddlywondering what else as a consciousness could have been quite sooverwhelming charlotte s response to the experiment of beingmore with her ought as she very well knew to have stamped theexperiment with the feeling of success so that if the successitself seemed a boon less substantial than the original image ofit it enjoyed thereby a certain analogy with our young woman saftertaste of amerigo s own determined demonstrations maggie wasto have retained for that matter more than one aftertaste andif i have spoken of the impressions fixed in her as soon as shehad so insidiously taken the field a definite note must bemade of her perception during those moments of charlotte sprompt uncertainty she had shown no doubt she couldn t nothave shown that she had arrived with an idea quite exactly asshe had shown her husband the night before that she wasawaiting him with a sentiment this analogy in the two situationswas to keep up for her the remembrance of a kinship of expressionin the two faces in respect to which all she as yet professed toherself was that she had affected them or at any rate thesensibility each of them so admirably covered in the same way to make the comparison at all was for maggie to return to itoften to brood upon it to extract from it the last dregs of itsinterest to play with it in short nervously vaguely incessantly as she might have played with a medallion containingon either side a cherished little portrait and suspended roundher neck by a gold chain of a firm fineness that no effort wouldever snap the miniatures were back to back but she saw themforever face to face and when she looked from one to the othershe found in charlotte s eyes the gleam of the momentary whatdoes she really want that had come and gone for her in theprince s so again she saw the other light the light touchedinto a glow both in portland place and in eaton square as soonas she had betrayed that she wanted no harm wanted no greaterharm of charlotte that is than to take in that she meant to goout with her she had been present at that process as personallyas she might have been present at some other domestic incident the hanging of a new picture say or the fitting of theprincipino with his first little trousers she remained present accordingly all the week so charminglyand systematically did mrs verver now welcome her company charlotte had but wanted the hint and what was it but the hint after all that during the so subdued but so ineffaceablepassage in the breakfast room she had seen her take it had beentaken moreover not with resignation not with qualifications orreserves however bland it had been taken with avidity withgratitude with a grace of gentleness that supplantedexplanations the very liberality of this accommodation mightindeed have appeared in the event to give its own account of thematter as if it had fairly written the princess down as a personof variations and had accordingly conformed but to a rule of tactin accepting these caprices for law the caprice actuallyprevailing happened to be that the advent of one of the ladiesanywhere should till the fit had changed become the sign unfailingly of the advent of the other and it was emblazoned in rich colour on the bright face of this period that mrs verver only wished to know on any occasion what was expected ofher only held herself there for instructions in order even tobetter them if possible the two young women while the passagelasted became again very much the companions of other days thedays of charlotte s prolonged visits to the admiring andbountiful maggie the days when equality of condition for themhad been all the result of the latter s native vagueness abouther own advantages the earlier elements flushed into life again the frequency the intimacy the high pitch of accompanyingexpression appreciation endearment confidence the rarer charmproduced in each by this active contribution to the felicity ofthe other all enhanced furthermore enhanced or qualified whoshould say which by a new note of diplomacy almost of anxiety just sensible on charlotte s part in particular of intensity ofobservance in the matter of appeal and response in thematter of making sure the princess might be disposed orgratified that resembled an attempt to play again with morerefinement at disparity of relation charlotte s attitude had in short its moments of flowering into pretty excesses ofcivility self effacements in the presence of others suddenlittle formalisms of suggestion and recognition that might haverepresented her sense of the duty of not losing sight of asocial distinction this impression came out most for maggiewhen in their easier intervals they had only themselves toregard and when her companion s inveteracy of never passingfirst of not sitting till she was seated of not interruptingtill she appeared to give leave of not forgetting too familiarly that in addition to being important she was alsosensitive had the effect of throwing over their intercourse akind of silver tissue of decorum it hung there above them like acanopy of state a reminder that though the lady in waiting wasan established favourite safe in her position a little queen however good natured was always a little queen and might withsmall warning remember it and yet another of these concomitants of feverish success allthe while was the perception that in another quarter too thingswere being made easy charlotte s alacrity in meeting her had inone sense operated slightly overmuch as an intervention it hadbegun to reabsorb her at the very hour of her husband s showingher that to be all there as the phrase was he likewise onlyrequired as one of the other phrases was too the straight tip she had heard him talk about the straight tip in his moods ofamusement at english slang in his remarkable displays ofassimilative power power worthy of better causes and higherinspirations and he had taken it from her at need in a waythat certainly in the first glow of relief had made her briefinterval seem large then however immediately and even thoughsuperficially there had declared itself a readjustment ofrelations to which she was once more practically a littlesacrificed i must do everything she had said withoutletting papa see what i do at least till it s done but shescarce knew how she proposed even for the next few days toblind or beguile this participant in her life what had in factpromptly enough happened she presently recognised was that ifher stepmother had beautifully taken possession of her and ifshe had virtually been rather snatched again thereby from herhusband s side so on the other hand this had with as littledelay entailed some very charming assistance for her in eatonsquare when she went home with charlotte from whatever happydemonstration for the benefit of the world in which theysupposed themselves to live that there was no smallest reasonwhy their closer association shouldn t be public and acclaimed at these times she regularly found that amerigo had come eitherto sit with his father in law in the absence of the ladies or tomake on his side precisely some such display of the easyworking of the family life as would represent the equivalent ofher excursions with charlotte under this particular impressionit was that everything in maggie most melted and went to pieces every thing that is that belonged to her disposition tochallenge the perfection of their common state it divided themagain that was true this particular turn of the tide cut themup afresh into pairs and parties quite as if a sense for theequilibrium was what between them all had most power ofinsistence quite as if amerigo himself were all the while atbottom equally thinking of it and watching it but as againstthat he was making her father not miss her and he could haverendered neither of them a more excellent service he was actingin short on a cue the cue given him by observation it had beenenough for him to see the shade of change in her behaviour hisinstinct for relations the most exquisite conceivable promptedhim immediately to meet and match the difference to play somehowinto its hands that was what it was she renewedly felt to havemarried a man who was sublimely a gentleman so that in spiteof her not wanting to translate all their delicacies into thegrossness of discussion she yet found again and again inportland place moments for saying if i didn t love you youknow for yourself i should still love you for him he lookedat her after such speeches as charlotte looked in eatonsquare when she called her attention to his benevolence throughthe dimness of the almost musing smile that took account of herextravagance harmless though it might be as a tendency toreckon with but my poor child charlotte might under thispressure have been on the point of replying that s the way nicepeople are all round so that why should one be surprised aboutit we re all nice together as why shouldn t we be if we hadn tbeen we wouldn t have gone far and i consider that we ve gonevery far indeed why should you take on as if you weren t aperfect dear yourself capable of all the sweetest things as ifyou hadn t in fact grown up in an atmosphere the atmosphere ofall the good things that i recognised even of old as soon as icame near you and that you ve allowed me now between you tomake so blessedly my own mrs verver might in fact have butjust failed to make another point a point charmingly natural toher as a grateful and irreproachable wife it isn t a bitwonderful i may also remind you that your husband should find when opportunity permits worse things to do than to go aboutwith mine i happen love to appreciate my husband i happenperfectly to understand that his acquaintance should becultivated and his company enjoyed some such happily provoked remarks as these from charlotte atthe other house had been in the air but we have seen how therewas also in the air for our young woman as an emanation fromthe same source a distilled difference of which the veryprinciple was to keep down objections and retorts thatimpression came back it had its hours of doing so and it mayinterest us on the ground of its having prompted in maggie afinal reflection a reflection out of the heart of which a lightflashed for her like a great flower grown in a night as soon asthis light had spread a little it produced in some quarters asurprising distinctness made her of a sudden ask herself whythere should have been even for three days the least obscurity the perfection of her success decidedly was like some strangeshore to which she had been noiselessly ferried and where with astart she found herself quaking at the thought that the boatmight have put off again and left her the word for it the wordthat flashed the light was that they were treating her thatthey were proceeding with her and for that matter with herfather by a plan that was the exact counterpart of her own itwas not from her that they took their cue but and this was whatin particular made her sit up from each other and with a depthof unanimity an exact coincidence of inspiration that when onceher attention had begun to fix it struck her as staring out ather in recovered identities of behaviour expression and tone they had a view of her situation and of the possible forms herown consciousness of it might take a view determined by thechange of attitude they had had ever so subtly to recognise inher on their return from matcham they had had to read into thissmall and all but suppressed variation a mute comment on theydidn t quite know what and it now arched over the princess shead like a vault of bold span that important communicationbetween them on the subject couldn t have failed of beingimmediate this new perception bristled for her as we have said with odd intimations but questions unanswered played in and outof it as well the question for instance of why suchpromptitude of harmony should have been important ah when shebegan to recover piece by piece the process became lively shemight have been picking small shining diamonds out of thesweepings of her ordered house she bent in this pursuit overher dust bin she challenged to the last grain the refuse of herinnocent economy then it was that the dismissed vision ofamerigo that evening in arrest at the door of her salottinowhile her eyes from her placed chair took him in then it wasthat this immense little memory gave out its full power sincethe question was of doors she had afterwards she now saw shutit out she had responsibly shut in as we have understood shutin there with her sentient self only the fact of hisreappearance and the plenitude of his presence these things hadbeen testimony after all to supersede any other for on thespot even while she looked the warmly washing wave hadtravelled far up the strand she had subsequently lived forhours she couldn t count under the dizzying smothering welterpositively in submarine depths where everything came to herthrough walls of emerald and mother of pearl though indeed shehad got her head above them for breath when face to face withcharlotte again on the morrow in eaton square meanwhile nonethe less as was so apparent the prior the prime impression hadremained in the manner of a spying servant on the other side ofthe barred threshold a witness availing himself in time of thelightest pretext to re enter it was as if he had found thispretext in her observed necessity of comparing comparing theobvious common elements in her husband s and her stepmother sways of now taking her with or without her witness at anyrate she was led by comparison to a sense of the quantity ofearnest intention operating and operating so harmoniously between her companions and it was in the mitigated midnight ofthese approximations that she had made out the promise of herdawn it was a worked out scheme for their not wounding her for theirbehaving to her quite nobly to which each had in some winningway induced the other to contribute and which therefore so faras that went proved that she had become with them a subject ofintimate study quickly quickly on a certain alarm taken eagerly and anxiously before they should without knowing it wound her they had signalled from house to house their cleveridea the idea by which for all these days her own idea hadbeen profiting they had built her in with their purpose whichwas why above her a vault seemed more heavily to arch so thatshe sat there in the solid chamber of her helplessness as in abath of benevolence artfully prepared for her over the brim ofwhich she could but just manage to see by stretching her neck baths of benevolence were very well but at least unless onewere a patient of some sort a nervous eccentric or a lost child one was usually not so immersed save by one s request it wasn tin the least what she had requested she had flapped her littlewings as a symbol of desired flight not merely as a plea for amore gilded cage and an extra allowance of lumps of sugar aboveall she hadn t complained not by the quaver of a syllable sowhat wound in particular had she shown her fear of receiving what wound had she received as to which she had exchanged theleast word with them if she had ever whined or moped they mighthave had some reason but she would be hanged she conversed withherself in strong language if she had been from beginning toend anything but pliable and mild it all came back inconsequence to some required process of their own a processoperating quite positively as a precaution and a policy theyhad got her into the bath and for consistency with themselves which was with each other must keep her there in that conditionshe wouldn t interfere with the policy which was established which was arranged her thought over this arrived at a greatintensity had indeed its pauses and timidities but always totake afterwards a further and lighter spring the ground waswell nigh covered by the time she had made out her husband andhis colleague as directly interested in preventing her freedom ofmovement policy or no policy it was they themselves who werearranged she must be kept in position so as not to disarrangethem it fitted immensely together the whole thing as soon asshe could give them a motive for strangely as it had by thistime begun to appear to herself she had hitherto not imaginedthem sustained by an ideal distinguishably different from herown of course they were arranged all four arranged but whathad the basis of their life been precisely but that they werearranged together amerigo and charlotte were arranged together but she to confine the matter only to herself was arrangedapart it rushed over her the full sense of all this with quiteanother rush from that of the breaking wave of ten days before and as her father himself seemed not to meet the vaguely clutching hand with which during the first shock of completeperception she tried to steady herself she felt very muchalone xxviithere had been from far back that is from the christmas timeon a plan that the parent and the child should do somethinglovely together and they had recurred to it on occasion nursedit and brought it up theoretically though without as yet quiteallowing it to put its feet to the ground the most it had donewas to try a few steps on the drawing room carpet with muchattendance on either side much holding up and guarding muchanticipation in fine of awkwardness or accident theircompanions by the same token had constantly assisted at theperformance following the experiment with sympathy and gaiety and never so full of applause maggie now made out for herself as when the infant project had kicked its little legs mostwildly kicked them for all the world across the channel andhalf the continent kicked them over the pyrenees and innocentlycrowed out some rich spanish name she asked herself at presentif it had been a real belief that they were but wanting forsome such adventure to snatch their moment whether either hadat any instant seen it as workable save in the form of a toy todangle before the other that they should take flight withoutwife or husband for one more look before they died at themadrid pictures as well as for a drop of further weak delay inrespect to three or four possible prizes privately offered rarities of the first water responsibly reported on andprofusely photographed still patiently awaiting their noiselessarrival in retreats to which the clue had not otherwise beengiven away the vision dallied with during the duskier days ineaton square had stretched to the span of three or four weeks ofspringtime for the total adventure three or four weeks in thevery spirit after all of their regular life as their regularlife had been persisting full of shared mornings afternoons evenings walks drives looks in at old places on vaguechances full also in especial of that purchased social ease the sense of the comfort and credit of their house which hadessentially the perfection of something paid for but which came on the whole so cheap that it might have been felt ascosting as costing the parent and child nothing it was formaggie to wonder at present if she had been sincere about theirgoing to ask herself whether she would have stuck to their planeven if nothing had happened her view of the impossibility of sticking to it now may give usthe measure of her sense that everything had happened adifference had been made in her relation to each of hercompanions and what it compelled her to say to herself was thatto behave as she might have behaved before would be to act foramerigo and charlotte with the highest hypocrisy she saw inthese days that a journey abroad with her father would more thananything else have amounted on his part and her own to a lastexpression of an ecstasy of confidence and that the charm of theidea in fact had been in some such sublimity day after day sheput off the moment of speaking as she inwardly and verycomprehensively called it speaking that is to her father andall the more that she was ridden by a strange suspense as to hishimself breaking silence she gave him time gave him duringseveral days that morning that noon that night and the nextand the next and the next even made up her mind that if he stoodoff longer it would be proof conclusive that he too wasn t atpeace they would then have been all successfully throwing dustin each other s eyes and it would be at last as if they mustturn away their faces since the silver mist that protected themhad begun to grow sensibly thin finally at the end of april she decided that if he should say nothing for another period oftwenty four hours she must take it as showing that they were inher private phraseology lost so little possible sincerity couldthere be in pretending to care for a journey to spain at theapproach of a summer that already promised to be hot such aproposal on his lips such an extravagance of optimism would behis way of being consistent for that he didn t really want tomove or to move further at the worst than back to fawns again could only signify that he wasn t at heart contented what hewanted at any rate and what he didn t want were in the event put to the proof for maggie just in time to give her a freshwind she had been dining with her husband in eaton square onthe occasion of hospitality offered by mr and mrs verver tolord and lady castledean the propriety of some demonstration ofthis sort had been for many days before our group the questionreduced to the mere issue of which of the two houses should firsttake the field the issue had been easily settled in the mannerof every issue referred in any degree to amerigo and charlotte the initiative obviously belonged to mrs verver who had gone tomatcham while maggie had stayed away and the evening in eatonsquare might have passed for a demonstration all the morepersonal that the dinner had been planned on intimate lines six other guests only in addition to the host and the hostess ofmatcham made up the company and each of these persons had formaggie the interest of an attested connection with the easterrevels at that visionary house their common memory of anoccasion that had clearly left behind it an ineffaceable charm this air of beatific reference less subdued in the others thanin amerigo and charlotte lent them together an inscrutablecomradeship against which the young woman s imagination broke ina small vain wave it wasn t that she wished she had been of the remembered partyand possessed herself of its secrets for she didn t care aboutits secrets she could concern herself at present absolutely with no secret but her own what occurred was simply that shebecame aware at a stroke of the quantity of further nourishmentrequired by her own and of the amount of it she might somehowextract from these people whereby she rose of a sudden to thedesire to possess and use them even to the extent of braving offairly defying of directly exploiting of possibly quiteenjoying under cover of an evil duplicity the felt element ofcuriosity with which they regarded her once she was conscious ofthe flitting wing of this last impression the perception irresistible that she was something for their queer experience just as they were something for hers there was no limit to herconceived design of not letting them escape she went and went again to night after her start was taken went positively asshe had felt herself going three weeks before on the morningwhen the vision of her father and his wife awaiting her togetherin the breakfast room had been so determinant in this otherscene it was lady castledean who was determinant who kindled thelight or at all events the heat and who acted on the nerves lady castledean whom she knew she so oddly didn t like inspite of reasons upon reasons the biggest diamonds on theyellowest hair the longest lashes on the prettiest falsesteyes the oldest lace on the most violet velvet the rightestmanner on the wrongest assumption her ladyship s assumption wasthat she kept at every moment of her life every advantage itmade her beautifully soft very nearly generous so she didn tdistinguish the little protuberant eyes of smaller socialinsects often endowed with such a range from the otherdecorative spots on their bodies and wings maggie had liked inlondon and in the world at large so many more people than shehad thought it right to fear right even to so much as judge that it positively quickened her fever to have to recognise inthis case such a lapse of all the sequences it was only that acharming clever woman wondered about her that is wondered abouther as amerigo s wife and wondered moreover with the intentionof kindness and the spontaneity almost of surprise the point of view that one was what she read in their freecontemplation in that of the whole eight there was something inamerigo to be explained and she was passed about all tenderlyand expertly like a dressed doll held in the right manner byits firmly stuffed middle for the account she could give shemight have been made to give it by pressure of her stomach shemight have been expected to articulate with a rare imitation ofnature oh yes i m here all the while i m also in my way asolid little fact and i cost originally a great deal of money cost that is my father for my outfit and let in my husbandfor an amount of pains toward my training that money wouldscarce represent well she would meet them in some such way and she translated her idea into action after dinner beforethey dispersed by engaging them all unconventionally almostviolently to dine with her in portland place just as they were if they didn t mind the same party which was the party shewanted oh she was going she was going she could feel itafresh it was a good deal as if she had sneezed ten times or hadsuddenly burst into a comic song there were breaks in theconnection as there would be hitches in the process she didn twholly see yet what they would do for her nor quite how herself she should handle them but she was dancing up and down beneath her propriety with the thought that she had at leastbegun something she so fairly liked to feel that she was a pointfor convergence of wonder it wasn t after all either thattheir wonder so much signified that of the cornered six whom itglimmered before her that she might still live to drive aboutlike a flock of sheep the intensity of her consciousness itssharpest savour was in the theory of her having diverted having as they said captured the attention of amerigo andcharlotte at neither of whom all the while did she so much asonce look she had pitched them in with the six for that matter so far as they themselves were concerned they had dropped forthe succession of minutes out of contact with their function had in short startled and impressed abandoned their post they re paralysed they re paralysed she commented deepwithin so much it helped her own apprehension to hang togetherthat they should suddenly lose their bearings her grasp of appearances was thus out of proportion to her viewof causes but it came to her then and there that if she couldonly get the facts of appearance straight only jam them downinto their place the reasons lurking behind them keptuncertain for the eyes by their wavering and shifting wouldn tperhaps be able to help showing it wasn t of course that theprince and mrs verver marvelled to see her civil to theirfriends it was rather precisely that civil was just what shewasn t she had so departed from any such custom of delicateapproach approach by the permitted note the suggested if theaccepted vagueness as would enable the people in question to puther off if they wished and the profit of her plan the effect ofthe violence she was willing to let it go for was exactly intheir being the people in question people she had seemed to berather shy of before and for whom she suddenly opened her mouthso wide later on we may add with the ground soon covered byher agitated but resolute step it was to cease to matter whatpeople they were or weren t but meanwhile the particular senseof them that she had taken home to night had done her the serviceof seeming to break the ice where that formation was thickest still more unexpectedly the service might have been the same forher father inasmuch as immediately when everyone had gone hedid exactly what she had been waiting for and despairing of anddid it as he did everything with a simplicity that left anypurpose of sounding him deeper of drawing him out further ofgoing in his own frequent phrase behind what he said nothingwhatever to do he brought it out straight made it bravely andbeautifully irrelevant save for the plea of what they shouldlose by breaking the charm i guess we won t go down there afterall will we mag just when it s getting so pleasant here that was all with nothing to lead up to it but it was done forher at a stroke and done not less more rather for amerigo andcharlotte on whom the immediate effect as she secretly as shealmost breathlessly measured it was prodigious everything nowso fitted for her to everything else that she could feel theeffect as prodigious even while sticking to her policy of givingthe pair no look there were thus some five wonderful minutesduring which they loomed to her sightless eyes on either sideof her larger than they had ever loomed before larger thanlife larger than thought larger than any danger or any safety there was thus a space of time in fine fairly vertiginous forher during which she took no more account of them than if theywere not in the room she had never never treated them in any such way not even justnow when she had plied her art upon the matcham band herpresent manner was an intenser exclusion and the air was chargedwith their silence while she talked with her other companion asif she had nothing but him to consider he had given her the noteamazingly by his allusion to the pleasantness that of such anoccasion as his successful dinner which might figure as theirbribe for renouncing so that it was all as if they were speakingselfishly counting on a repetition of just such extensions ofexperience maggie achieved accordingly an act of unprecedentedenergy threw herself into her father s presence as by theabsolute consistency with which she held his eyes saying toherself at the same time that she smiled and talked andinaugurated her system what does he mean by it that s thequestion what does he mean but studying again all the signs inhim that recent anxiety had made familiar and counting thestricken minutes on the part of the others it was in theirsilence that the others loomed as she felt she had had nomeasure she afterwards knew of this duration but it drew outand out really to what would have been called in simplerconditions awkwardness as if she herself were stretching thecord ten minutes later however in the homeward carriage towhich her husband cutting delay short had proceeded at thefirst announcement ten minutes later she was to stretch italmost to breaking the prince had permitted her to linger muchless before his move to the door than they usually lingered atthe gossiping close of such evenings which she all responsive took for a sign of his impatience to modify for her the oddeffect of his not having and of charlotte s not having instantly acclaimed the issue of the question debated or moreexactly settled before them he had had time to become aware ofthis possible impression in her and his virtually urging herinto the carriage was connected with his feeling that he musttake action on the new ground a certain ambiguity in her wouldabsolutely have tormented him but he had already found somethingto soothe and correct as to which she had on her side a shrewdnotion of what it would be she was herself for that matter prepared and she was of a truth as she took her seat in thebrougham amazed at her preparation it allowed her scarce aninterval she brought it straight out i was certain that was what father would say if i should leavehim alone i have been leaving him alone and you see the effect he hates now to move he likes too much to be with us but if yousee the effect she felt herself magnificently keeping it up perhaps you don t see the cause the cause my dear is toolovely her husband on taking his place beside her had during a minuteor two for her watching sense neither said nor done anything he had been for that sense as if thinking waiting deciding yet it was still before he spoke that he as she felt it to be definitely acted he put his arm round her and drew her close indulged in the demonstration the long firm embrace by hissingle arm the infinite pressure of her whole person to his own that such opportunities had so often suggested and prescribed held accordingly and as she could but too intimately feel exquisitely solicited she had said the thing she was intendingand desiring to say and as to which she felt even more than shefelt anything else that whatever he might do she mustn t beirresponsible yes she was in his exerted grasp and she knewwhat that was but she was at the same time in the grasp of herconceived responsibility and the extraordinary thing was that of the two intensities the second was presently to become thesharper he took his time for it meanwhile but he met her speechafter a fashion the cause of your father s deciding not to go yes and of my having wanted to let it act for him quietly imean without my insistence she had in her compressed state another pause and it made her feel as if she were immenselyresisting strange enough was this sense for her and altogethernew the sense of possessing by miraculous help some advantagethat absolutely then and there in the carriage as they rolled she might either give up or keep strange inexpressiblystrange so distinctly she saw that if she did give it up sheshould somehow give up everything for ever and what herhusband s grasp really meant as her very bones registered wasthat she should give it up it was exactly for this that he hadresorted to unfailing magic he knew how to resort to it hecould be on occasion as she had lately more than ever learned so munificent a lover all of which was precisely a part of thecharacter she had never ceased to regard in him as princely apart of his large and beautiful ease his genius for charm forintercourse for expression for life she should have but to layher head back on his shoulder with a certain movement to make itdefinite for him that she didn t resist to this as they went every throb of her consciousness prompted her every throb thatis but one the throb of her deeper need to know where she really was by the time she had uttered the rest of her idea therefore she was still keeping her head and intending to keepit though she was also staring out of the carriage window witheyes into which the tears of suffered pain had risen indistinguishable perhaps happily in the dusk she was makingan effort that horribly hurt her and as she couldn t cry out her eyes swam in her silence with them all the same throughthe square opening beside her through the grey panorama of thelondon night she achieved the feat of not losing sight of whatshe wanted and her lips helped and protected her by being ableto be gay it s not to leave you my dear for that he ll giveup anything just as he would go off anywhere i think you know if you would go with him i mean you and he alone maggiepursued with her gaze out of her window for which amerigo s answer again took him a moment ah the dearold boy you would like me to propose him something well if you think you could bear it and leave the prince asked you and charlotte alone why not maggie had also to wait a minute but when she spokeit came clear why shouldn t charlotte be just one of myreasons my not liking to leave her she has always been so good so perfect to me but never so wonderfully as just now we havesomehow been more together thinking for the time almost onlyof each other it has been quite as in old days and sheproceeded consummately for she felt it as consummate it s asif we had been missing each other had got a little apart thoughgoing on so side by side but the good moments if one only waitsfor them she hastened to add come round of themselves moreover you ve seen for yourself since you ve made it up so tofather feeling for yourself in your beautiful way everydifference every air that blows not having to be told orpushed only being perfect to live with through your habit ofkindness and your exquisite instincts but of course you veseen all the while that both he and i have deeply felt howyou ve managed managed that he hasn t been too much alone andthat i on my side haven t appeared to what you might call neglect him this is always she continued what i can neverbless you enough for of all the good things you ve done for meyou ve never done anything better she went on explaining as forthe pleasure of explaining even though knowing he mustrecognise as a part of his easy way too her description of hislarge liberality your taking the child down yourself thosedays and your coming each time to bring him away nothing inthe world nothing you could have invented would have keptfather more under the charm besides you know how you ve alwayssuited him and how you ve always so beautifully let it seem tohim that he suits you only it has been these last weeks as ifyou wished just in order to please him to remind him of itafresh so there it is she wound up it s your doing you veproduced your effect that of his wanting not to be even for amonth or two where you re not he doesn t want to bother or boreyou that i think you know he never has done and if you llonly give me time i ll come round again to making it my care asalways that he shan t but he can t bear you out of his sight she had kept it up and up filling it out crowding it in andall really without difficulty for it was every word of it thanks to a long evolution of feeling what she had been primedto the brim with she made the picture forced it upon him hungit before him remembering happily how he had gone so far oneday supported by the principino as to propose the zoo in eatonsquare to carry with him there on the spot under this pleasantinspiration both his elder and his younger companion with thelatter of whom he had taken the tone that they were introducinggranddaddy granddaddy nervous and rather funking it to lionsand tigers more or less at large touch by touch she thus droppedinto her husband s silence the truth about his good nature andhis good manners and it was this demonstration of his virtue precisely that added to the strangeness even for herself ofher failing as yet to yield to him it would be a question but ofthe most trivial act of surrender the vibration of a nerve themere movement of a muscle but the act grew important betweenthem just through her doing perceptibly nothing nothing but talkin the very tone that would naturally have swept her intotenderness she knew more and more every lapsing minute taughther how he might by a single rightness make her cease to watchhim that rightness a million miles removed from the queeractual falling so short which would consist of his breaking outto her diviningly indulgently with the last happyinconsequence come away with me somewhere you and then weneedn t think we needn t even talk of anything of anyoneelse five words like that would answer her would break herutterly down but they were the only ones that would so serve she waited for them and there was a supreme instant when by thetestimony of all the rest of him she seemed to feel them in hisheart and on his lips only they didn t sound and as that madeher wait again so it made her more intensely watch this in turnshowed her that he too watched and waited and how much he hadexpected something that he now felt wouldn t come yes itwouldn t come if he didn t answer her if he but said the wrongthings instead of the right if he could say the right everythingwould come it hung by a hair that everything might crystallisefor their recovered happiness at his touch this possibilityglowed at her however for fifty seconds only then to turncold and as it fell away from her she felt the chill of realityand knew again all but pressed to his heart and with his breathupon her cheek the slim rigour of her attitude a rigour beyondthat of her natural being they had silences at last that werealmost crudities of mutual resistance silences that persistedthrough his felt effort to treat her recurrence to the part hehad lately played to interpret all the sweetness of her sotalking to him as a manner of making love to him ah it was nosuch manner heaven knew for maggie she could make love ifthis had been in question better than that on top of which itcame to her presently to say keeping in with what she hadalready spoken except of course that for the question of goingoff somewhere he d go readily quite delightedly with you iverily believe he d like to have you for a while to himself do you mean he thinks of proposing it the prince after amoment sounded oh no he doesn t ask as you must so often have seen but ibelieve he d go like a shot as you say if you were to suggestit it had the air she knew of a kind of condition made and shehad asked herself while she spoke if it wouldn t cause his arm tolet her go the fact that it didn t suggested to her that she hadmade him of a sudden still more intensely think think withsuch concentration that he could do but one thing at once and itwas precisely as if the concentration had the next moment beenproved in him he took a turn inconsistent with the superficialimpression a jump that made light of their approach to gravityand represented for her the need in him to gain time that shemade out was his drawback that the warning from her had come tohim and had come to charlotte after all too suddenly thatthey were in face of it rearranging that they had to rearrange was all before her again yet to do as they would like they mustenjoy a snatch longer or shorter of recovered independence amerigo for the instant was but doing as he didn t like and itwas as if she were watching his effort without disguise what syour father s idea this year then about fawns will he go atwhitsuntide and will he then stay on maggie went through the form of thought he will really do iimagine as he has in so many ways so often done before dowhatever may seem most agreeable to yourself and there s ofcourse always charlotte to be considered only their going earlyto fawns if they do go she said needn t in the least entailyour and my going ah amerigo echoed it needn t in the least entail your and mygoing we can do as we like what they may do needn t trouble us sincethey re by good fortune perfectly happy together oh the prince returned your father s never so happy as withyou near him to enjoy his being so well i may enjoy it said maggie but i m not the cause ofit you re the cause her husband declared of the greater part ofeverything that s good among us but she received this tributein silence and the next moment he pursued if mrs verver hasarrears of time with you to make up as you say she ll scarcelydo it or you scarcely will by our cutting your and my cutting too loose i see what you mean maggie mused he let her for a little to give her attention to it after which shall i just quite of a sudden he asked propose him ajourney maggie hesitated but she brought forth the fruit of reflection it would have the merit that charlotte then would be with me with me i mean so much more also that i shouldn t by choosingsuch a time for going away seem unconscious and ungrateful seemnot to respond seem in fact rather to wish to shake her off ishould respond on the contrary very markedly by being herealone with her for a month and would you like to be here alone with her for a month i could do with it beautifully or we might even she saidquite gaily go together down to fawns you could be so very content without me the prince presentlyinquired yes my own dear if you could be content for a while withfather that would keep me up i might for the time she wenton go to stay there with charlotte or better still she mightcome to portland place oho said the prince with cheerful vagueness i should feel you see she continued that the two of us wereshowing the same sort of kindness amerigo thought the two of us charlotte and i maggie again hesitated you and i darling i see i see he promptly took it in and what reason shall igive give i mean your father for asking him to go off why the very simplest if youconscientiously can the desire said maggie to be agreeableto him just that only something in this reply made her husband again reflect conscientiously why shouldn t i conscientiously it wouldn t by your own contention he developed represent any surprisefor him i must strike him sufficiently as at the worst thelast person in the world to wish to do anything to hurt him ah there it was again for maggie the note already sounded thenote of the felt need of not working harm why this precautionaryview she asked herself afresh when her father had complained at the very least as little as herself with their stillnesstogether so perfect what had suggested so around them theattitude of sparing them her inner vision fixed it once more this attitude saw it in the others as vivid and concrete extended it straight from her companion to charlotte before shewas well aware accordingly she had echoed in this intensity ofthought amerigo s last words you re the last person in theworld to wish to do anything to hurt him she heard herself heard her tone after she had spoken andheard it the more that for a minute after she felt herhusband s eyes on her face very close too close for her to seehim he was looking at her because he was struck and lookinghard though his answer when it came was straight enough why isn t that just what we have been talking about that i veaffected you as fairly studying his comfort and his pleasure hemight show his sense of it the prince went on by proposing tome an excursion and you would go with him maggie immediately asked he hung fire but an instant per dio she also had her pause but she broke it since gaiety was in theair with an intense smile you can say that safely because theproposal s one that of his own motion he won t make she couldn t have narrated afterwards and in fact was at a lossto tell herself by what transition what rather markedabruptness of change in their personal relation their drive cameto its end with a kind of interval established almost confessedto between them she felt it in the tone with which he repeated after her safely safely as regards being thrown with him perhaps after all insuch a case too long he s a person to think you might easilyfeel yourself to be so it won t maggie said come fromfather he s too modest their eyes continued to meet on it from corner to corner of thebrougham oh your modesty between you but he still smiledfor it so that unless i insist we shall simply go on as we are well we re going on beautifully he answered though by nomeans with the effect it would have had if their mutetransaction that of attempted capture and achieved escape hadnot taken place as maggie said nothing none the less togainsay his remark it was open to him to find himself the nextmoment conscious of still another idea i wonder if it would do i mean for me to break in to break in between your father and his wife but there would be a way hesaid we can make charlotte ask him and then as maggie herselfnow wondered echoing it again we can suggest to her to suggestto him that he shall let me take him off oh said maggie then if he asks her why i so suddenly break out she ll be ableto tell him the reason they were stopping and the footman who had alighted had rungat the house door that you think it would be so charming that i think it would be so charming that we ve persuaded herwill be convincing i see maggie went on while the footman came back to let themout i see she said again though she felt a littledisconcerted what she really saw of a sudden was that herstepmother might report her as above all concerned for theproposal and this brought her back her need that her fathershouldn t think her concerned in any degree for anything shealighted the next instant with a slight sense of defeat herhusband to let her out had passed before her and a little inadvance he awaited her on the edge of the low terrace a stephigh that preceded their open entrance on either side of whichone of their servants stood the sense of a life tremendouslyordered and fixed rose before her and there was something inamerigo s very face while his eyes again met her own through thedusky lamplight that was like a conscious reminder of it hehad answered her just before distinctly and it appeared toleave her nothing to say it was almost as if having planned forthe last word she saw him himself enjoying it it was almost asif in the strangest way in the world he were paying her back by the production of a small pang that of a new uneasiness forthe way she had slipped from him during their drive xxviiimaggie s new uneasiness might have had time to drop inasmuch asshe not only was conscious during several days that followed ofno fresh indication for it to feed on but was even struck inquite another way with an augmentation of the symptoms of thatdifference she had taken it into her head to work for sherecognised by the end of a week that if she had been in a mannercaught up her father had been not less so with the effect of herhusband s and his wife s closing in together round them and oftheir all having suddenly begun as a party of four to lead alife gregarious and from that reason almost hilarious so far asthe easy sound of it went as never before it might have been anaccident and a mere coincidence so at least she said to herselfat first but a dozen chances that furthered the whole appearancehad risen to the surface pleasant pretexts oh certainlypleasant as pleasant as amerigo in particular could make them for associated undertakings quite for shared adventures for itsalways turning out amusingly that they wanted to do very muchthe same thing at the same time and in the same way funny allthis was to some extent in the light of the fact that thefather and daughter for so long had expressed so few positivedesires yet it would be sufficiently natural that if amerigo andcharlotte had at last got a little tired of each other s companythey should find their relief not so much in sinking to therather low level of their companions as in wishing to pull thelatter into the train in which they so constantly moved we rein the train maggie mutely reflected after the dinner in eatonsquare with lady castledean we ve suddenly waked up in it andfound ourselves rushing along very much as if we had been put induring sleep shoved like a pair of labelled boxes into thevan and since i wanted to go i m certainly going she mighthave added i m moving without trouble they re doing it all forus it s wonderful how they understand and how perfectly itsucceeds for that was the thing she had most immediately toacknowledge it seemed as easy for them to make a quartette as ithad formerly so long appeared for them to make a pair ofcouples this latter being thus a discovery too absurdly belated the only point at which day after day the success appeared atall qualified was represented as might have been said by herirresistible impulse to give her father a clutch when the trainindulged in one of its occasional lurches then there was nodenying it his eyes and her own met so that they werethemselves doing active violence as against the others to thatvery spirit of union or at least to that very achievement ofchange which she had taken the field to invoke the maximum of change was reached no doubt the day the matchamparty dined in portland place the day really perhaps ofmaggie s maximum of social glory in the sense of its showing forher own occasion her very own with every one else extravagantlyrallying and falling in absolutely conspiring to make her itsheroine it was as if her father himself always with moreinitiative as a guest than as a host had dabbled too in theconspiracy and the impression was not diminished by the presenceof the assinghams likewise very much caught up now aftersomething of a lull by the side wind of all the rest of themotion and giving our young woman so far at least as fanny wasconcerned the sense of some special intention of encouragementand applause fanny who had not been present at the otherdinner thanks to a preference entertained and expressed bycharlotte made a splendid show at this one in neworange coloured velvet with multiplied turquoises and with aconfidence furthermore as different as possible her hostessinferred from her too marked betrayal of a belittled state atmatcham maggie was not indifferent to her own opportunity toredress this balance which seemed for the hour part of ageneral rectification she liked making out for herself that onthe high level of portland place a spot exempt on all sorts ofgrounds from jealous jurisdictions her friend could feel as good as any one and could in fact at moments almost appear totake the lead in recognition and celebration so far as theevening might conduce to intensify the lustre of the littleprincess mrs assingham produced on her the impression of givingher constantly her cue for this and it was in truth partly byher help intelligently quite gratefully accepted that thelittle princess in maggie was drawn out and emphasised shecouldn t definitely have said how it happened but she feltherself for the first time in her career living up to thepublic and popular notion of such a personage as it pressed uponher from all round rather wondering inwardly too while she didso at that strange mixture in things through which the popularnotion could be evidenced for her by such supposedly great onesof the earth as the castledeans and their kind fanny assinghammight really have been there at all events like one of theassistants in the ring at the circus to keep up the pace of thesleek revolving animal on whose back the lady in short spangledskirts should brilliantly caper and posture that was all doubtless maggie had forgotten had neglected had declined tobe the little princess on anything like the scale open to her but now that the collective hand had been held out to her withsuch alacrity so that she might skip up into the light even asseemed to her modest mind with such a show of pink stocking andsuch an abbreviation of white petticoat she could strike herselfas perceiving under arched eyebrows where her mistake had been she had invited for the later hours after her dinner a freshcontingent the whole list of her apparent london acquaintance which was again a thing in the manner of little princesses forwhom the princely art was a matter of course that was what shewas learning to do to fill out as a matter of course herappointed her expected her imposed character and though therewere latent considerations that somewhat interfered with thelesson she was having to night an inordinate quantity ofpractice none of it so successful as when quite wittingly shedirected it at lady castledean who was reduced by it at last toan unprecedented state of passivity the perception of this highresult caused mrs assingham fairly to flush with responsive joy she glittered at her young friend from moment to moment quitefeverishly it was positively as if her young friend had in somemarvellous sudden supersubtle way become a source of succourto herself become beautifully divinely retributive theintensity of the taste of these registered phenomena was in factthat somehow by a process and through a connexion not again tobe traced she so practised at the same time on amerigo andcharlotte with only the drawback her constant check andsecond thought that she concomitantly practised perhaps stillmore on her father this last was a danger indeed that for much of the ensuing time had its hours of strange beguilement those at which her sensefor precautions so suffered itself to lapse that she felt hercommunion with him more intimate than any other it couldn t butpass between them that something singular was happening so muchas this she again and again said to herself whereby the comfortof it was there after all to be noted just as much as thepossible peril and she could think of the couple they formedtogether as groping with sealed lips but with mutual looks thathad never been so tender for some freedom some fiction somefigured bravery under which they might safely talk of it themoment was to come and it finally came with an effect aspenetrating as the sound that follows the pressure of an electricbutton when she read the least helpful of meanings into theagitation she had created the merely specious description oftheir case would have been that after being for a long time asa family delightfully uninterruptedly happy they had still hada new felicity to discover a felicity for which blessedly herfather s appetite and her own in particular had been kept freshand grateful this livelier march of their intercourse as a wholewas the thing that occasionally determined in him the clutchinginstinct we have glanced at very much as if he had said to her in default of her breaking silence first everything isremarkably pleasant isn t it but where for it after all arewe up in a balloon and whirling through space or down in thedepths of the earth in the glimmering passages of a gold mine the equilibrium the precious condition lasted in spite ofrearrangement there had been a fresh distribution of thedifferent weights but the balance persisted and triumphed allof which was just the reason why she was forbidden face to facewith the companion of her adventure the experiment of a test ifthey balanced they balanced she had to take that it deprivedher of every pretext for arriving by however covert a process at what he thought but she had her hours thus of feeling supremely linked to himby the rigour of their law and when it came over her that allthe while the wish on his side to spare her might be what mostworked with him this very fact of their seeming to have nothing inward really to talk about wrapped him up for her in a kind ofsweetness that was wanting as a consecration even in heryearning for her husband she was powerless however was onlymore utterly hushed when the interrupting flash came when shewould have been all ready to say to him yes this is by everyappearance the best time we ve had yet but don t you see allthe same how they must be working together for it and how myvery success my success in shifting our beautiful harmony to anew basis comes round to being their success above all theircleverness their amiability their power to hold out theircomplete possession in short of our life for how could shesay as much as that without saying a great deal more withoutsaying they ll do everything in the world that suits us saveonly one thing prescribe a line for us that will make themseparate how could she so much as imagine herself even faintlymurmuring that without putting into his mouth the very words thatwould have made her quail separate my dear do you want themto separate then you want us to you and me for how can the oneseparation take place without the other that was the questionthat in spirit she had heard him ask with its dread train moreover of involved and connected inquiries their ownseparation his and hers was of course perfectly thinkable butonly on the basis of the sharpest of reasons well the sharpest the very sharpest would be that they could no longer afford asit were he to let his wife she to let her husband run themin such compact formation and say they accepted this account oftheir situation as a practical finality acting upon it andproceeding to a division would no sombre ghosts of the smotheredpast on either side show across the widening strait paleunappeased faces or raise in the very passage deprecating denouncing hands meanwhile however such things might be she was to have occasionto say to herself that there might be but a deeper treachery inrecoveries and reassurances she was to feel alone again as shehad felt at the issue of her high tension with her husband duringtheir return from meeting the castledeans in eaton square theevening in question had left her with a larger alarm but then alull had come the alarm after all was yet to be confirmed there came an hour inevitably when she knew with a chill whatshe had feared and why it had taken this hour a month toarrive but to find it before her was thoroughly to recognise it for it showed her sharply what amerigo had meant in alluding to aparticular use that they might make for their reaffirmed harmonyand prosperity of charlotte the more she thought at present of the tone he had employed to express their enjoyment of thisresource the more it came back to her as the product of aconscious art of dealing with her he had been conscious at themoment of many things conscious even not a little ofdesiring and thereby of needing to see what she would do in agiven case the given case would be that of her being to acertain extent as she might fairly make it out menaced horrible as it was to impute to him any intention represented by such a word why it was that to speak of making her stepmotherintervene as they might call it in a question that seemed justthen and there quite peculiarly their own business why it wasthat a turn so familiar and so easy should at the worst strikeher as charged with the spirit of a threat was an odditydisconnected for her temporarily from its grounds theadventure of an imagination within her that possibly had lost itsway that precisely was doubtless why she had learned to wait as the weeks passed by with a fair or rather indeed with anexcessive imitation of resumed serenity there had been noprompt sequel to the prince s equivocal light and that made forpatience yet she was none the less to have to admit afterdelay that the bread he had cast on the waters had come home and that she should thus be justified of her old apprehension the consequence of this in turn was a renewed pang in presenceof his remembered ingenuity to be ingenious with her whatdidn t what mightn t that mean when she had so absolutelynever at any point of contact with him put him by as much asthe value of a penny to the expense of sparing doubting fearing her of having in any way whatever to reckon with her the ingenuity had been in his simply speaking of their use ofcharlotte as if it were common to them in an equal degree andhis triumph on the occasion had been just in the simplicity she couldn t and he knew it say what was true oh you use her and i use her if you will yes but we use her ever sodifferently and separately not at all in the same way or degree there s nobody we really use together but ourselves don t yousee by which i mean that where our interests are the same i canso beautifully so exquisitely serve you for everything and youcan so beautifully so exquisitely serve me the only personeither of us needs is the other of us so why as a matter ofcourse in such a case as this drag in charlotte she couldn t so challenge him because it would have been andthere she was paralysed the note it would have translateditself on the spot for his ear into jealousy and fromreverberation to repercussion would have reached her father sexactly in the form of a cry piercing the stillness of peacefulsleep it had been for many days almost as difficult for her tocatch a quiet twenty minutes with her father as it had formerlybeen easy there had been in fact of old the time sostrangely seemed already far away an inevitability in herlonger passages with him a sort of domesticated beauty in thecalculability round about them of everything but at presentcharlotte was almost always there when amerigo brought her toeaton square where amerigo was constantly bringing her andamerigo was almost always there when charlotte brought herhusband to portland place where charlotte was constantlybringing him the fractions of occasions the chance minutes thatput them face to face had as yet of late contrived to countbut little between them either for the sense of opportunity orfor that of exposure inasmuch as the lifelong rhythm of theirintercourse made against all cursory handling of deep things they had never availed themselves of any given quarter of an hourto gossip about fundamentals they moved slowly through largestill spaces they could be silent together at any time beautifully with much more comfort than hurriedly expressive itappeared indeed to have become true that their common appealmeasured itself for vividness just by this economy of sound they might have been talking at each other when they talkedwith their companions but these latter assuredly were not inany directer way to gain light on the current phase of theirrelation such were some of the reasons for which maggiesuspected fundamentals as i have called them to be rising by anew movement to the surface suspected it one morning late inmay when her father presented himself in portland place alone he had his pretext of that she was fully aware the principino two days before had shown signs happily not persistent of afeverish cold and had notoriously been obliged to spend theinterval at home this was ground ample ground for punctualinquiry but what it wasn t ground for she quickly found herselfreflecting was his having managed in the interest of his visit to dispense so unwontedly as their life had recently come to bearranged with his wife s attendance it had so happened that sheherself was for the hour exempt from her husband s and it willat once be seen that the hour had a quality all its own when inote that remembering how the prince had looked in to say he wasgoing out the princess whimsically wondered if their respectivesposi mightn t frankly be meeting whimsically hoped indeed theywere temporarily so disposed of strange was her need atmoments to think of them as not attaching an excessiveimportance to their repudiation of the general practice that hadrested only a few weeks before on such a consecrated rightness repudiations surely were not in the air they had none of themcome to that for wasn t she at this minute testifying directlyagainst them by her own behaviour when she should confess tofear of being alone with her father to fear of what he mightthen ah with such a slow painful motion as she had a horrorof say to her then would be time enough for amerigo andcharlotte to confess to not liking to appear to foregather she had this morning a wonderful consciousness both of dreading aparticular question from him and of being able to check yes evento disconcert magnificently by her apparent manner of receivingit any restless imagination he might have about its importance the day bright and soft had the breath of summer it made themtalk to begin with of fawns of the way fawns invited maggieaware the while that in thus regarding with him the sweetnessof its invitation to one couple just as much as to another herhumbugging smile grew very nearly convulsive that was it andthere was relief truly of a sort in taking it in she washumbugging him already by absolute necessity as she had never never done in her life doing it up to the full height of whatshe had allowed for the necessity in the great dimly shiningroom where declining for his reasons to sit down he movedabout in amerigo s very footsteps the necessity affected her aspressing upon her with the very force of the charm itself of theold pleasantness between them so candidly playing up thereagain of the positive flatness of their tenderness a surfaceall for familiar use quite as if generalised from the longsuccession of tapestried sofas sweetly faded on which histheory of contentment had sat through unmeasured pauses besideher own she knew from this instant knew in advance and as wellas anything would ever teach her that she must never intermitfor a solitary second her so highly undertaking to prove thatthere was nothing the matter with her she saw of a sudden everything she might say or do in the light of that undertaking established connections from it with any number of remotematters struck herself for instance as acting all in itsinterest when she proposed their going out in the exercise oftheir freedom and in homage to the season for a turn in theregent s park this resort was close at hand at the top ofportland place and the principino beautifully better hadalready proceeded there under high attendance all of whichconsiderations were defensive for maggie all of which became toher mind part of the business of cultivating continuity upstairs while she left him to put on something to go out in the thought of his waiting below for her in possession of theempty house brought with it sharply if briefly one of herabrupt arrests of consistency the brush of a vain imaginationalmost paralysing her often for the minute before her glass the vivid look in other words of the particular differencehis marriage had made the particular difference seemed at suchinstants the loss more than anything else of their old freedom their never having had to think where they were togetherconcerned of any one of anything but each other it hadn t beenher marriage that did it that had never for three seconds suggested to either of them that they must act diplomatically must reckon with another presence no not even with herhusband s she groaned to herself while the vain imaginationlasted why did he marry ah why did he and then it came upto her more than ever that nothing could have been more beautifulthan the way in which till charlotte came so much more closelyinto their life amerigo hadn t interfered what she had gone onowing him for this mounted up again to her eyes like a columnof figures or call it even if one would a house of cards itwas her father s wonderful act that had tipped the house down andmade the sum wrong with all of which immediately after herquestion her why did he why did he rushed back inevitably the confounding the overwhelming wave of the knowledge of hisreason he did it for me he did it for me she moaned he didit exactly that our freedom meaning beloved man simply andsolely mine should be greater instead of less he did it divinely to liberate me so far as possible from caring whatbecame of him she found time upstairs even in her haste asshe had repeatedly found time before to let the wondermentsinvolved in these recognitions flash at her with their customaryeffect of making her blink the question in especial of whethershe might find her solution in acting herself in the spirit ofwhat he had done in forcing her care really to grow as muchless as he had tried to make it thus she felt the whole weightof their case drop afresh upon her shoulders was confronted unmistakably with the prime source of her haunted state it allcame from her not having been able not to mind not to mind whatbecame of him not having been able without anxiety to let himgo his way and take his risk and lead his life she had madeanxiety her stupid little idol and absolutely now while shestuck a long pin a trifle fallaciously into her hat she had with an approach to irritation told her maid a new woman whomshe had lately found herself thinking of as abysmal that shedidn t want her she tried to focus the possibility of someunderstanding between them in consequence of which he should cutloose very near indeed it looked any such possibility thatconsciousness too had taken its turn by the time she was ready all the vibration all the emotion of this present passage being precisely in the very sweetness of their lapse back into theconditions of the simpler time into a queer resemblance betweenthe aspect and the feeling of the moment and those of numberlessother moments that were sufficiently far away she had been quickin her preparation in spite of the flow of the tide thatsometimes took away her breath but a pause once more was stillleft for her to make a pause at the top of the stairs beforeshe came down to him in the span of which she asked herself ifit weren t thinkable from the perfectly practical point of view that she should simply sacrifice him she didn t go into thedetail of what sacrificing him would mean she didn t need to sodistinct was it in one of her restless lights that there he wasawaiting her that she should find him walking up and down thedrawing room in the warm fragrant air to which the open windowsand the abundant flowers contributed slowly and vaguely movingthere and looking very slight and young and superficially manageable almost as much like her child putting it a littlefreely as like her parent with the appearance about him aboveall of having perhaps arrived just on purpose to say it to her himself in so many words sacrifice me my own love dosacrifice me do sacrifice me should she want to should sheinsist on it she might verily hear him bleating it at her allconscious and all accommodating like some precious spotless exceptionally intelligent lamb the positive effect of theintensity of this figure however was to make her shake it awayin her resumed descent and after she had rejoined him after shehad picked him up she was to know the full pang of the thoughtthat her impossibility was made absolutely by hisconsciousness by the lucidity of his intention this she feltwhile she smiled there for him again all hypocritically whileshe drew on fair fresh gloves while she interrupted the processfirst to give his necktie a slightly smarter twist and then tomake up to him for her hidden madness by rubbing her nose intohis cheek according to the tradition of their frankest levity from the instant she should be able to convict him of intending every issue would be closed and her hypocrisy would have toredouble the only way to sacrifice him would be to do so withouthis dreaming what it might be for she kissed him she arrangedhis cravat she dropped remarks she guided him out she held hisarm not to be led but to lead him and taking it to her by muchthe same intimate pressure she had always used when a littlegirl to mark the inseparability of her doll she did all thesethings so that he should sufficiently fail to dream of what theymight be for xxixthere was nothing to show that her effort in any degree fellshort till they got well into the park and he struck her asgiving unexpectedly the go by to any serious search for theprincipino the way they sat down awhile in the sun was a sign ofthat his dropping with her into the first pair of sequesteredchairs they came across and waiting a little after they wereplaced as if now at last she might bring out as between them something more specific it made her but feel the more sharplyhow the specific in almost any direction was utterly forbiddenher how the use of it would be for all the world like undoingthe leash of a dog eager to follow up a scent it would come out the specific where the dog would come out would run to earth somehow the truth for she was believing herself in relation tothe truth at which she mustn t so much as indirectly point such at any rate was the fashion in which her passionateprudence played over possibilities of danger reading symptomsand betrayals into everything she looked at and yet having tomake it evident while she recognised them that she didn twince there were moments between them in their chairs when hemight have been watching her guard herself and trying to think ofsomething new that would trip her up there were pauses duringwhich with her affection as sweet and still as the sunshine shemight yet as at some hard game over a table for money havebeen defying him to fasten upon her the least little complicationof consciousness she was positively proud afterwards of thegreat style in which she had kept this up later on at thehour s end when they had retraced their steps to find amerigoand charlotte awaiting them at the house she was able to say toherself that truly she had put her plan through even thoughonce more setting herself the difficult task of making theirrelation every minute of the time not fall below the standardof that other hour in the treasured past which hung therebehind them like a framed picture in a museum a high watermarkfor the history of their old fortune the summer evening in thepark at fawns when side by side under the trees just as now they had let their happy confidence lull them with its mostgolden tone there had been the possibility of a trap for her atpresent in the very question of their taking up anew thatresidence wherefore she had not been the first to sound it inspite of the impression from him of his holding off to see whatshe would do she was saying to herself in secret can we again in this form migrate there can i for myself undertake it face all the intenser keeping up and stretching out indefinitely impossibly that our conditions in the country aswe ve established and accepted them would stand for she hadpositively lost herself in this inward doubt so much she wassubsequently to remember but remembering then too that hercompanion though perceptibly perhaps as if not to be eager hadbroken the ice very much as he had broken it in eaton squareafter the banquet to the castledeans her mind had taken a long excursion wandered far into the visionof what a summer at fawns with amerigo and charlotte still moreeminently in presence against that higher sky would bring forth wasn t her father meanwhile only pretending to talk of it justas she was in a manner pretending to listen he got off it finally at all events for the transition it couldn t well helpthrusting out at him it had amounted exactly to an arrest of herprivate excursion by the sense that he had begun to imitate oh as never yet the ancient tone of gold it had verily come fromhim at last the question of whether she thought it would be verygood but very good indeed that he should leave england for aseries of weeks on some pretext with the prince then it hadbeen that she was to know her husband s menace hadn t reallydropped since she was face to face with the effect of it ah the effect of it had occupied all the rest of their walk hadstayed out with them and come home with them besides making itimpossible that they shouldn t presently feign to recollect howrejoining the child had been their original purpose maggie suneffaced note was that it had at the end of five minutes more driven them to that endeavour as to a refuge and caused themafterwards to rejoice as well that the boy s irrepressiblyimportunate company in due course secured and enjoyed with theextension imparted by his governess a person expectant ofconsideration constituted a cover for any awkwardness for thatwas what it had all come to that the dear man had spoken to herto try her quite as he had been spoken to himself by charlotte with the same fine idea the princess took it in on the spot firmly grasping it she heard them together her father and hiswife dealing with the queer case the prince tells me thatmaggie has a plan for your taking some foreign journey with him and as he likes to do everything she wants he has suggested myspeaking to you for it as the thing most likely to make youconsent so i do speak see being always so eager myself asyou know to meet maggie s wishes i speak but without quiteunderstanding this time what she has in her head why shouldshe of a sudden at this particular moment desire to ship youoff together and to remain here alone with me the compliment sall to me i admit and you must decide quite as you like theprince is quite ready evidently to do his part but you ll haveit out with him that is you ll have it out with her somethingof that kind was what in her mind s ear maggie heard and this after his waiting for her to appeal to him directly was herfather s invitation to her to have it out well as she could sayto herself all the rest of the day that was what they did whilethey continued to sit there in their penny chairs that was whatthey had done as much as they would now ever ever have outanything the measure of this at least had been given thateach would fight to the last for the protection for theperversion of any real anxiety she had confessed instantly with her humbugging grin not flinching by a hair meeting hiseyes as mildly as he met hers she had confessed to her fancythat they might both he and his son in law have welcomed suchan escapade since they had both been so long so furiouslydomestic she had almost cocked her hat under the inspiration ofthis opportunity to hint how a couple of spirited young men reacting from confinement and sallying forth arm in arm mightencounter the agreeable in forms that would strike them for thetime at least as novel she had felt for fifty seconds with hereyes all so sweetly and falsely in her companion s horriblyvulgar yet without minding it either such luck should she haveif to be nothing worse than vulgar would see her through and ithought amerigo might like it better she had said thanwandering off alone do you mean that he won t go unless i take him she had considered here and never in her life had she consideredso promptly and so intently if she really put it that way herhusband challenged might belie the statement so that whatwould that do but make her father wonder make him perhaps askstraight out why she was exerting pressure she couldn t ofcourse afford to be suspected for an instant of exertingpressure which was why she was obliged only to make answer wouldn t that be just what you must have out with him decidedly if he makes me the proposal but he hasn t made ityet oh once more how she was to feel she had smirked perhaps he stoo shy because you re so sure he so really wants my company i think he has thought you might like it well i should but with this he looked away from her andshe held her breath to hear him either ask if she wished him toaddress the question to amerigo straight or inquire if sheshould be greatly disappointed by his letting it drop what had settled her as she was privately to call it was that he haddone neither of these things and had thereby markedly stood offfrom the risk involved in trying to draw out her reason toattenuate on the other hand this appearance and quite as if tofill out the too large receptacle made so musingly by hisabstention he had himself presently given her a reason hadpositively spared her the effort of asking whether he judgedcharlotte not to have approved he had taken everything onhimself that was what had settled her she had had to wait verylittle more to feel with this how much he was taking the pointhe made was his lack of any eagerness to put time and space onany such scale between himself and his wife he wasn t sounhappy with her far from it and maggie was to hold that he hadgrinned back paternally through his rather shielding glasses in easy emphasis of this as to be able to hint that he requiredthe relief of absence therefore unless it was for the princehimself oh i don t think it would have been for amerigo himself amerigo and i maggie had said perfectly rub on together well then there we are i see and she had again with sublime blandness assented there we are charlotte and i too her father had gaily proceeded perfectlyrub on together and then he had appeared for a little to bemaking time to put it only so he had mildly and happilyadded to put it only so he had spoken as if he might easilyput it much better yet as if the humour of contentedunderstatement fairly sufficed for the occasion he had playedthen either all consciously or all unconsciously intocharlotte s hands and the effect of this was to render treblyoppressive maggie s conviction of charlotte s plan she had donewhat she wanted his wife had which was also what amerigo hadmade her do she had kept her test maggie s test from becomingpossible and had applied instead a test of her own it wasexactly as if she had known that her stepdaughter would be afraidto be summoned to say under the least approach tocross examination why any change was desirable and it was forour young woman herself still more prodigiously as if herfather had been capable of calculations to match of judging itimportant he shouldn t be brought to demand of her what was thematter with her why otherwise with such an opportunity hadn the demanded it always from calculation that was why that waswhy he was terrified of the retort he might have invoked what my dear if you come to that is the matter with you when aminute later on he had followed up his last note by a touch ortwo designed still further to conjure away the ghost of theanomalous at that climax verily she would have had to be dumb tothe question there seems a kind of charm doesn t there on ourlife and quite as if just lately it had got itself somehowrenewed had waked up refreshed a kind of wicked selfishprosperity perhaps as if we had grabbed everything fixedeverything down to the last lovely object for the last glasscase of the last corner left over of my old show that s theonly take off that it has made us perhaps lazy a wee bitlanguid lying like gods together all careless of mankind do you consider that we re languid that form of rejoinder shehad jumped at for the sake of its pretty lightness do youconsider that we are careless of mankind living as we do in thebiggest crowd in the world and running about always pursued andpursuing it had made him think indeed a little longer than she had meant but he came up again as she might have said smiling well idon t know we get nothing but the fun do we no she had hastened to declare we certainly get nothing butthe fun we do it all he had remarked so beautifully we do it all so beautifully she hadn t denied this for amoment i see what you mean well i mean too he had gone on that we haven t no doubt enough the sense of difficulty enough enough for what enough not to be selfish i don t think you are selfish she had returned and hadmanaged not to wail it i don t say that it s me particularly or that it s you orcharlotte or amerigo but we re selfish together we move as aselfish mass you see we want always the same thing he had goneon and that holds us that binds us together we want eachother he had further explained only wanting it each time for each other that s what i call the happy spell but it salso a little possibly the immorality the immorality she had pleasantly echoed well we re tremendously moral for ourselves that is for eachother and i won t pretend that i know exactly at whoseparticular personal expense you and i for instance are happy what it comes to i daresay is that there s something haunting as if it were a bit uncanny in such a consciousness of ourgeneral comfort and privilege unless indeed he had rambled on it s only i to whom fantastically it says so much that s alli mean at any rate that it s sort of soothing as if we weresitting about on divans with pigtails smoking opium and seeingvisions let us then be up and doing what is it longfellowsays that seems sometimes to ring out like the police breakingin into our opium den to give us a shake but the beauty of itis at the same time that we are doing we re doing that is after all what we went in for we re working it our life ourchance whatever you may call it as we saw it as we felt it from the first we have worked it and what more can you do thanthat it s a good deal for me he had wound up to have madecharlotte so happy to have so perfectly contented her you froma good way back were a matter of course i mean your being allright so that i needn t mind your knowing that my greatinterest since then has rather inevitably been in making sureof the same success very much to your advantage as well forcharlotte if we ve worked our life our idea really as i say if at any rate i can sit here and say that i ve worked my shareof it it has not been what you may call least by our having putcharlotte so at her ease that has been soothing all round thathas curled up as the biggest of the blue fumes or whatever theyare of the opium don t you see what a cropper we would havecome if she hadn t settled down as she has and he had concludedby turning to maggie as for something she mightn t really havethought of you darling in that case i verily believe wouldhave been the one to hate it most to hate it maggie had wondered to hate our having with our tremendous intentions not broughtit off and i daresay i should have hated it for you even morethan for myself that s not unlikely perhaps when it was for me after all thatyou did it he had hesitated but only a moment i never told you so well charlotte herself soon enough told me but i never told her her father had answered are you very sure she had presently asked well i like to think how thoroughly i was taken with her andhow right i was and how fortunate to have that for my basis itold her all the good i thought of her then that maggie had returned was precisely part of thegood i mean it was precisely part of it that she could sobeautifully understand yes understand everything everything and in particular your reasons her telling me thatshowed me how she had understood they were face to face again now and she saw she had made hiscolour rise it was as if he were still finding in her eyes theconcrete image the enacted scene of her passage with charlotte which he was now hearing of for the first time and as to which itwould have been natural he should question her further hisforbearance to do so would but mark precisely the complicationof his fears what she does like he finally said is the wayit has succeeded your marriage yes my whole idea the way i ve been justified that s the joyi give her if for her either it had failed that however was not worth talking about he had broken off you think thenyou could now risk fawns risk it well morally from the point of view i was talking of that ofour sinking deeper into sloth our selfishness somehow seems atits biggest down there maggie had allowed him the amusement of her not taking this up is charlotte she had simply asked really ready oh if you and i and amerigo are whenever one cornerscharlotte he had developed more at his ease one finds thatshe only wants to know what we want which is what we got herfor what we got her for exactly and so for a little even thoughwith a certain effect of oddity in their more or less successfulease they left it left it till maggie made the remark that itwas all the same wonderful her stepmother should be willing before the season was out to exchange so much company for somuch comparative solitude ah he had then made answer that s because her idea i think this time is that we shall have more people more than we vehitherto had in the country don t you remember that that originally was what we were to get her for oh yes to give us a life maggie had gone through the form ofrecalling this and the light of their ancient candour shiningfrom so far back had seemed to bring out some things sostrangely that with the sharpness of the vision she had risento her feet well with a life fawns will certainly do hehad remained in his place while she looked over his head thepicture in her vision had suddenly swarmed the vibration wasthat of one of the lurches of the mystic train in which with hercompanion she was travelling but she was having to steadyherself this time before meeting his eyes she had measuredindeed the full difference between the move to fawns because eachof them now knew the others wanted it and the pairing off for ajourney of her husband and her father which nobody knew thateither wanted more company at fawns would be effectuallyenough the key in which her husband and her stepmother were atwork there was truly no question but that she and her fathermust accept any array of visitors no one could try to marry himnow what he had just said was a direct plea for that and whatwas the plea itself but an act of submission to charlotte hehad from his chair been noting her look but he had the nextminute also risen and then it was they had reminded each otherof their having come out for the boy their junction with him andwith his companion successfully effected the four had moved homemore slowly and still more vaguely yet with a vagueness thatpermitted of maggie s reverting an instant to the larger issue if we have people in the country then as you were saying doyou know for whom my first fancy would be you may be amused butit would be for the castledeans i see but why should i be amused well i mean i am myself i don t think i like her and yet ilike to see her which as amerigo says is rum but don t you feel she s very handsome her father inquired yes but it isn t for that then what is it for simply that she may be there just there before us it s as ifshe may have a value as if something may come of her i don t inthe least know what and she rather irritates me meanwhile idon t even know i admit why but if we see her often enough imay find out does it matter so very much her companion had asked while theymoved together she had hesitated you mean because you do rather like her he on his side too had waited a little but then he had taken itfrom her yes i guess i do rather like her which she accepted for the first case she could recall of theirnot being affected by a person in the same way it came backtherefore to his pretending but she had gone far enough and toadd to her appearance of levity she further observed that thoughthey were so far from a novelty she should also immediatelydesire at fawns the presence of the assinghams that puteverything on a basis independent of explanations yet it wasextraordinary at the same time how much once in the countryagain with the others she was going as they used to say athome to need the presence of the good fanny it was thestrangest thing in the world but it was as if mrs assinghammight in a manner mitigate the intensity of her consciousness ofcharlotte it was as if the two would balance one against theother as if it came round again in that fashion to her idea ofthe equilibrium it would be like putting this friend into herscale to make weight into the scale with her father and herself amerigo and charlotte would be in the other therefore it wouldtake the three of them to keep that one straight and as thisplayed all duskily in her mind it had received from her father with a sound of suddenness a luminous contribution ah rather do let s have the assinghams it would be to have them she had said as we used so much tohave them for a good long stay in the old way and on the oldterms as regular boarders fanny used to call it that is ifthey ll come as regular boarders on the old terms that s what i should liketoo but i guess they ll come her companion had added in a toneinto which she had read meanings the main meaning was that hefelt he was going to require them quite as much as she was hisrecognition of the new terms as different from the old what wasthat practically but a confession that something had happened and a perception that interested in the situation she had helpedto create mrs assingham would be by so much as this concerned in its inevitable development it amounted to anintimation off his guard that he should be thankful for someone to turn to if she had wished covertly to sound him he hadnow in short quite given himself away and if she had even atthe start needed anything more to settle her here assuredly wasenough he had hold of his small grandchild as they retracedtheir steps swinging the boy s hand and not bored as he neverwas by his always bristling like a fat little porcupine withshrill interrogation points so that secretly while they went she had wondered again if the equilibrium mightn t have been morereal mightn t above all have demanded less strange a study hadit only been on the books that charlotte should give him aprincipino of his own she had repossessed herself now of hisother arm only this time she was drawing him back gently helplessly back to what they had tried for the hour to getaway from just as he was consciously drawing the child and ashigh miss bogle on her left representing the duties of home wascomplacently drawing her the duties of home when the house inportland place reappeared showed even from a distance asvividly there before them amerigo and charlotte had come in that is amerigo had charlotte rather having come out and thepair were perched together in the balcony he bare headed shedivested of her jacket her mantle or whatever but crowned witha brilliant brave hat responsive to the balmy day which maggieimmediately spotted as new as insuperably original as worn in characteristic generous harmony for the first time all evidently to watch for the return of the absent to be there totake them over again as punctually as possible they were gay they were amused in the pleasant morning they leaned across therail and called down their greeting lighting up the front of thegreat black house with an expression that quite broke themonotony that might almost have shocked the decency of portlandplace the group on the pavement stared up as at the peopledbattlements of a castle even miss bogle who carried her headmost aloft gaped a little through the interval of space astoward truly superior beings there could scarce have been somuch of the open mouth since the dingy waits on christmas eve had so lamentably chanted for pennies the time when amerigo insatiable for english customs had come out with a gasped santissima vergine to marvel at the depositaries of thistradition and purchase a reprieve maggie s individual gape wasinevitably again for the thought of how the pair would be atwork xxxshe had not again for weeks had mrs assingham so effectuallyin presence as on the afternoon of that lady s return from theeaster party at matcham but the intermission was made up as soonas the date of the migration to fawns that of the more or lesssimultaneous adjournment of the two houses began to bediscussed it had struck her promptly that this renewal withan old friend of the old terms she had talked of with herfather was the one opening for her spirit that wouldn t toomuch advertise or betray her even her father who had always ashe would have said believed in their ancient ally wouldn tnecessarily suspect her of invoking fanny s aid toward anyspecial inquiry and least of all if fanny would only act asfanny so easily might maggie s measure of fanny s ease wouldhave been agitating to mrs assingham had it been all at oncerevealed to her as for that matter it was soon destined tobecome even on a comparatively graduated showing our youngwoman s idea in particular was that her safety her escape frombeing herself suspected of suspicion would proceed from thisfriend s power to cover to protect and as might be evenshowily to represent her represent that is her relation to theform of the life they were all actually leading this woulddoubtless be as people said a large order but that mrs assingham existed substantially or could somehow be madeprevailingly to exist for her private benefit was the finestflower maggie had plucked from among the suggestions sown likeabundant seed on the occasion of the entertainment offered inportland place to the matcham company mrs assingham thatnight rebounding from dejection had bristled with bravery andsympathy she had then absolutely she had perhaps recklessly for herself betrayed the deeper and darker consciousness animpression it would now be late for her inconsistently to attemptto undo it was with a wonderful air of giving out all thesetruths that the princess at present approached her again makingdoubtless at first a sufficient scruple of letting her know whatin especial she asked of her yet not a bit ashamed as she infact quite expressly declared of fanny s discerned foreboding ofthe strange uses she might perhaps have for her quite from thefirst really maggie said extraordinary things to her such as you can help me you know my dear when nobody else can suchas i almost wish upon my word that you had something thematter with you that you had lost your health or your money oryour reputation forgive me love so that i might be with youas much as i want or keep you with me without exciting comment without exciting any other remark than that such kindnesses are like me we have each our own way of making up for ourunselfishness and maggie who had no small self at all asagainst her husband or her father and only a weak and uncertainone as against her stepmother would verily at this crisis haveseen mrs assingham s personal life or liberty sacrificed withouta pang the attitude that the appetite in question maintained in her wasto draw peculiar support moreover from the current aspects andagitations of her victim this personage struck her in truth asready for almost anything as not perhaps effusively protesting yet as wanting with a restlessness of her own to know what shewanted and in the long run which was none so long either therewas to be no difficulty as happened about that it was as if for all the world maggie had let her see that she held her thatshe made her fairly responsible for something not to beginwith dotting all the i s nor hooking together all the links buttreating her without insistence rather with caressingconfidence as there to see and to know to advise and to assist the theory visibly had patched itself together for her that thedear woman had somehow from the early time had a hand in alltheir fortunes so that there was no turn of their commonrelations and affairs that couldn t be traced back in some degreeto her original affectionate interest on this affectionateinterest the good lady s young friend now built before her eyes very much as a wise or even as a mischievous child playingon the floor might pile up blocks skilfully and dizzily withan eye on the face of a covertly watching elder when the blocks tumbled down they but acted after the nature ofblocks yet the hour would come for their rising so high that thestructure would have to be noticed and admired mrs assingham sappearance of unreservedly giving herself involved meanwhile onher own side no separate recognitions her face of almostanxious attention was directed altogether to her young friend sso vivid felicity it suggested that she took for granted at themost certain vague recent enhancements of that state if theprincess now more than before was going and going she wasprompt to publish that she beheld her go that she had alwaysknown she would sooner or later and that any appeal forparticipation must more or less contain and invite the note oftriumph there was a blankness in her blandness assuredly andvery nearly an extravagance in her generalising gaiety aprecipitation of cheer particularly marked whenever they metagain after short separations meetings during the first flush ofwhich maggie sometimes felt reminded of other looks in otherfaces of two strangely unobliterated impressions above all thephysiognomic light that had played out in her husband at theshock she had come at last to talk to herself of the shock ofhis first vision of her on his return from matcham andgloucester and the wonder of charlotte s beautiful bold waveringgaze when the next morning in eaton square this old friend hadturned from the window to begin to deal with her if she had dared to think of it so crudely she would have saidthat fanny was afraid of her afraid of something she might sayor do even as for their few brief seconds amerigo andcharlotte had been which made exactly an expressive elementcommon to the three the difference however was that this lookhad in the dear woman its oddity of a constant renewal whereasit had never for the least little instant again peeped out of theothers other looks other lights radiant and steady with theothers had taken its place reaching a climax so short a timeago that morning of the appearance of the pair on the balcony ofher house to overlook what she had been doing with her father when their general interested brightness and beauty attuned tothe outbreak of summer had seemed to shed down warmth andwelcome and the promise of protection they were conjoined not todo anything to startle her and now at last so completely that with experience and practice they had almost ceased to feartheir liability mrs assingham on the other hand deprecatingsuch an accident not less had yet less assurance as having lesscontrol the high pitch of her cheer accordingly the tentative adventurous expressions of the would be smiling order thatpreceded her approach even like a squad of skirmishers orwhatever they were called moving ahead of the baggage train these things had at the end of a fortnight brought a dozen timesto our young woman s lips a challenge that had the cunning toawait its right occasion but of the relief of which as ademonstration she meanwhile felt no little need you ve such adread of my possibly complaining to you that you keep pealing allthe bells to drown my voice but don t cry out my dear tillyou re hurt and above all ask yourself how i can be so wicked asto complain what in the name of all that s fantastic can youdream that i have to complain of such inquiries the princesstemporarily succeeded in repressing and she did so in ameasure by the aid of her wondering if this ambiguity with whichher friend affected her wouldn t be at present a good deal likethe ambiguity with which she herself must frequently affect herfather she wondered how she should enjoy on his part such atake up as she but just succeeded from day to day in sparingmrs assingham and that made for her trying to be as easy withthis associate as mr verver blessed man all indulgent butall inscrutable was with his daughter she had extracted fromher none the less a vow in respect to the time that if thecolonel might be depended on they would spend at fawns andnothing came home to her more in this connection or inspiredher with a more intimate interest than her sense of absolutelyseeing her interlocutress forbear to observe that charlotte sview of a long visit even from such allies was there to bereckoned with fanny stood off from that proposition as visibly to the princess and as consciously to herself as she might have backed away fromthe edge of a chasm into which she feared to slip a truth thatcontributed again to keep before our young woman her own constantdanger of advertising her subtle processes that charlotte shouldhave begun to be restrictive about the assinghams which she hadnever and for a hundred obviously good reasons been before this in itself was a fact of the highest value for maggie and ofa value enhanced by the silence in which fanny herself so muchtoo unmistakably dressed it what gave it quite thrillingly itsprice was exactly the circumstance that it thus opposed her toher stepmother more actively if she was to back up her friendsfor holding out than she had ever yet been opposed though ofcourse with the involved result of the fine chance given mrs verver to ask her husband for explanations ah from the momentshe should be definitely caught in opposition there would benaturally no saying how much charlotte s opportunities mightmultiply what would become of her father she hauntedly asked if his wife on the one side should begin to press him to callhis daughter to order and the force of old habit to put it onlyat that should dispose him not less effectively to believe inthis young person at any price there she was all round imprisoned in the circle of the reasons it was impossible sheshould give certainly give him the house in the country was hishouse and thereby was charlotte s it was her own and amerigo sonly so far as its proper master and mistress should profuselyplace it at their disposal maggie felt of course that she saw nolimit to her father s profusion but this couldn t be even at thebest the case with charlotte s whom it would never be decent when all was said to reduce to fighting for her preferences there were hours truly when the princess saw herself as notunarmed for battle if battle might only take place withoutspectators this last advantage for her was however too sadly out of thequestion her sole strength lay in her being able to see that ifcharlotte wouldn t want the assinghams it would be because thatsentiment too would have motives and grounds she had all thewhile command of one way of meeting any objection any complaint on his wife s part reported to her by her father it would beopen to her to retort to his possible what are your reasons mydear by a lucidly produced what are hers love please isn tthat what we had better know mayn t her reasons be a dislike beautifully founded of the presence and thereby of theobservation of persons who perhaps know about her things it sinconvenient to her they should know that hideous card shemight in mere logic play being by this time at her stillswifter private pace intimately familiar with all the fingeredpasteboard in her pack but she could play it only on theforbidden issue of sacrificing him the issue so forbidden thatit involved even a horror of finding out if he would really haveconsented to be sacrificed what she must do she must do bykeeping her hands off him and nothing meanwhile as we see hadless in common with that scruple than such a mercilessmanipulation of their yielding beneficiaries as her spirit soboldly revelled in she saw herself in this connexion withoutdetachment saw others alone with intensity otherwise she mighthave been struck fairly have been amused by her free assignmentof the pachydermatous quality if she could face the awkwardnessof the persistence of her friends at fawns in spite of charlotte she somehow looked to them for an inspiration of courage thatwould improve upon her own they were in short not onlythemselves to find a plausibility and an audacity but weresomehow by the way to pick up these forms for her maggie aswell and she felt indeed that she was giving them scant timelonger when one afternoon in portland place she broke out withan irrelevance that was merely superficial what awfulness in heaven s name is there between them what doyou believe what do you know oh if she went by faces her visitor s sudden whiteness at this might have carried her far fanny assingham turned pale for it but there was something in such an appearance in the look it putinto the eyes that renewed maggie s conviction of what thiscompanion had been expecting she had been watching it come comefrom afar and now that it was there after all and the firstconvulsion over they would doubtless soon find themselves in amore real relation it was there because of the sunday luncheonthey had partaken of alone together it was there as strangelyas one would because of the bad weather the cold perverse junerain that was making the day wrong it was there because itstood for the whole sum of the perplexities and duplicities amongwhich our young woman felt herself lately to have picked hersteps it was there because amerigo and charlotte were againpaying together alone a week end visit which it had beenmaggie s plan infernally to promote just to see if this time they really would it was there because she had kept fanny onher side from paying one she would manifestly have been glad topay and had made her come instead stupidly vacantly boringly to luncheon all in the spirit of celebrating the fact that theprince and mrs verver had thus put it into her own power todescribe them exactly as they were it had abruptly occurred intruth that maggie required the preliminary help of determininghow they were though on the other hand before her guest hadanswered her question everything in the hour and the place everything in all the conditions affected her as crying it out her guest s stare of ignorance above all that of itself atfirst cried it out between them what do you mean anything there shouldn t be there shouldn t have been all thistime do you believe there is or what s your idea fanny s idea was clearly to begin with that her young friendhad taken her breath away but she looked at her very straightand very hard do you speak from a suspicion of your own i speak at last from a torment forgive me if it comes out i ve been thinking for months and months and i ve no one to turnto no one to help me to make things out no impression but myown don t you see to go by you ve been thinking for months and months mrs assingham tookit in but what then dear maggie have you been thinking well horrible things like a little beast that i perhaps am that there may be something something wrong and dreadful something they cover up the elder woman s colour had begun to come back she was able though with a visible effort to face the question less amazedly you imagine poor child that the wretches are in love is thatit but maggie for a minute only stared back at her help me to findout what i imagine i don t know i ve nothing but my perpetualanxiety have you any do you see what i mean if you ll tell metruly that at least one way or the other will do something forme fanny s look had taken a peculiar gravity a fulness with whichit seemed to shine is what it comes to that you re jealous ofcharlotte do you mean whether i hate her and maggie thought no noton account of father ah mrs assingham returned that isn t what one wouldsuppose what i ask is if you re jealous on account of yourhusband well said maggie presently perhaps that may be all if i munhappy i m jealous it must come to the same thing and withyou at least i m not afraid of the word if i m jealous don tyou see i m tormented she went on and all the more if i mhelpless and if i m both helpless and tormented i stuff mypocket handkerchief into my mouth i keep it there for the mostpart night and day so as not to be heard too indecentlymoaning only now with you at last i can t keep it longer i ve pulled it out and here i am fairly screaming at you they re away she wound up so they can t hear and i m by amiracle of arrangement not at luncheon with father at home ilive in the midst of miracles of arrangement half of which iadmit are my own i go about on tiptoe i watch for every sound i feel every breath and yet i try all the while to seem assmooth as old satin dyed rose colour have you ever thought ofme she asked as really feeling as i do her companion conspicuously required to be clear jealous unhappy tormented no said mrs assingham but at the sametime and though you may laugh at me for it i m bound toconfess that i ve never been so awfully sure of what i may callknowing you here you are indeed as you say such a deep littleperson i ve never imagined your existence poisoned and sinceyou wish to know if i consider that it need be i ve not theleast difficulty in speaking on the spot nothing decidedly strikes me as more unnecessary for a minute after this they remained face to face maggie hadsprung up while her friend sat enthroned and after moving toand fro in her intensity now paused to receive the light she hadinvoked it had accumulated considerably by this time roundmrs assingham s ample presence and it made even to our youngwoman s own sense a medium in which she could at last take adeeper breath i ve affected you these months and these lastweeks in especial as quiet and natural and easy but it was a question that took not imperceptibly someanswering you ve never affected me from the first hour ibeheld you as anything but in a way all your own absolutelygood and sweet and beautiful in a way as i say mrs assinghamalmost caressingly repeated just all your very own nobodyelse s at all i ve never thought of you but as outside of uglythings so ignorant of any falsity or cruelty or vulgarity asnever to have to be touched by them or to touch them i ve nevermixed you up with them there would have been time enough forthat if they had seemed to be near you but they haven t ifthat s what you want to know you ve only believed me contented then because you ve believedme stupid mrs assingham had a free smile now for the length of thisstride dissimulated though it might be in a graceful littlefrisk if i had believed you stupid i shouldn t have thought youinteresting and if i hadn t thought you interesting i shouldn thave noted whether i knew you as i ve called it or not whati ve always been conscious of is your having concealed about yousomewhere no small amount of character quite as much in fact fanny smiled as one could suppose a person of your size able tocarry the only thing was she explained that thanks to yournever calling one s attention to it i hadn t made out much moreabout it and should have been vague above all as to where youcarried it or kept it somewhere under i should simply havesaid like that little silver cross you once showed me blest bythe holy father that you always wear out of sight next yourskin that relic i ve had a glimpse of with which she continuedto invoke the privilege of humour but the precious littleinnermost say this time little golden personal nature of you blest by a greater power i think even than the pope thatyou ve never consentingly shown me i m not sure you ve everconsentingly shown it to anyone you ve been in general toomodest maggie trying to follow almost achieved a little fold of herforehead i strike you as modest to day modest when i standhere and scream at you oh your screaming i ve granted you is something new i mustfit it on somewhere the question is however mrs assinghamfurther proceeded of what the deuce i can fit it on to do youmean she asked to the fact of our friends being fromyesterday to to morrow at a place where they may more or lessirresponsibly meet she spoke with the air of putting it asbadly for them as possible are you thinking of their beingthere alone of their having consented to be and then as shehad waited without result for her companion to say but isn t ittrue that after you had this time again at the eleventh hour said you wouldn t they would really much rather not have gone yes they would certainly much rather not have gone but iwanted them to go then my dear child what in the world is the matter i wanted to see if they would and they ve had to maggieadded it was the only thing her friend appeared to wonder from the moment you and yourfather backed out oh i don t mean go for those people i mean go for us forfather and me maggie went on because now they know they know fanny assingham quavered that i ve been for some time past taking more notice notice ofthe queer things in our life maggie saw her companion for an instant on the point of askingher what these queer things might be but mrs assingham had thenext minute brushed by that ambiguous opening and taken as sheevidently felt a better one and is it for that you did it imean gave up the visit it s for that i did it to leave them to themselves as theyless and less want or at any rate less and less venture toappear to want to be left as they had for so long arrangedthings the princess went on you see they sometimes have tobe and then as if baffled by the lucidity of this mrs assingham for a little said nothing now do you think i mmodest with time however fanny could brilliantly think anything thatwould serve i think you re wrong that my dear is my answerto your question it demands assuredly the straightest i canmake i see no awfulness i suspect none i m deeplydistressed she added that you should do anything else it drew again from maggie a long look you ve never evenimagined anything ah god forbid for it s exactly as a woman of imagination thati speak there s no moment of my life at which i m not imaginingsomething and it s thanks to that darling mrs assinghampursued that i figure the sincerity with which your husband whom you see as viciously occupied with your stepmother isinterested is tenderly interested in his admirable adorablewife she paused a minute as to give her friend the full benefitof this as to maggie s measure of which however no sign came and then poor woman haplessly she crowned her effort hewouldn t hurt a hair of your head it had produced in maggie at once and apparently in theintended form of a smile the most extraordinary expression ah there it is but her guest had already gone on and i m absolutely certainthat charlotte wouldn t either it kept the princess with her strange grimace standing there no charlotte wouldn t either that s how they ve had again togo off together they ve been afraid not to lest it shoulddisturb me aggravate me somehow work upon me as i insistedthat they must that we couldn t all fail though father andcharlotte hadn t really accepted as i did this they had to yieldto the fear that their showing as afraid to move together wouldcount for them as the greater danger which would be the danger you see of my feeling myself wronged their least danger theyknow is in going on with all the things that i ve seemed toaccept and that i ve given no indication at any moment of notaccepting everything that has come up for them has come up inan extraordinary manner without my having by a sound or a signgiven myself away so that it s all as wonderful as you mayconceive they move at any rate among the dangers i speak of between that of their doing too much and that of their not havingany longer the confidence or the nerve or whatever you may callit to do enough her tone by this time might have shown astrangeness to match her smile which was still more marked asshe wound up and that s how i make them do what i like it had an effect on mrs assingham who rose with thedeliberation that from point to point marked the widening ofher grasp my dear child you re amazing amazing you re terrible maggie thoughtfully shook her head no i m not terrible andyou don t think me so i do strike you as surprising no doubt but surprisingly mild because don t you see i am mild i canbear anything oh bear mrs assingham fluted for love said the princess fanny hesitated of your father for love maggie repeated it kept her friend watching of your husband for love maggie said again it was for the moment as if the distinctness of this might havedetermined in her companion a choice between two or three highlydifferent alternatives mrs assingham s rejoinder at allevents however much or however little it was a choice waspresently a triumph speaking with this love of your own then have you undertaken to convey to me that you believe your husbandand your father s wife to be in act and in fact lovers of eachother and then as the princess didn t at first answer do youcall such an allegation as that mild oh i m not pretending to be mild to you but i ve told you andmoreover you must have seen for yourself how much so i ve beento them mrs assingham more brightly again bridled is that what youcall it when you make them for terror as you say do as youlike ah there wouldn t be any terror for them if they had nothing tohide mrs assingham faced her quite steady now are you reallyconscious love of what you re saying i m saying that i m bewildered and tormented and that i ve noone but you to speak to i ve thought i ve in fact been sure that you ve seen for yourself how much this is the case it s whyi ve believed you would meet me half way half way to what to denouncing fanny asked two persons friends of years whom i ve always immensely admired and liked and against whom i haven t the shadow of a charge to make maggie looked at her with wide eyes i had much rather youshould denounce me than denounce them denounce me denounce me she said if you can see your way it was exactly what sheappeared to have argued out with herself if conscientiously you can denounce me if conscientiously you can revile me if conscientiously you can put me in my place for a low mindedlittle pig well said mrs assingham consideringly as she paused foremphasis i think i shall be saved her friend took it for a minute however by carrying thoughtfuleyes eyes verily portentous over her head you say you ve noone to speak to and you make a point of your having so disguisedyour feelings not having as you call it given yourself away have you then never seen it not only as your right but as yourbounden duty worked up to such a pitch to speak to yourhusband i ve spoken to him said maggie mrs assingham stared ah then it isn t true that you ve madeno sign maggie had a silence i ve made no trouble i ve made no scene i ve taken no stand i ve neither reproached nor accused him you ll say there s a way in all that of being nasty enough oh dropped from fanny as if she couldn t help it but i don t think strangely enough that he regards me asnasty i think that at bottom for that is said the princess the strangeness he s sorry for me yes i think that deepwithin he pities me her companion wondered for the state you ve let yourself getinto for not being happy when i ve so much to make me so you ve everything said mrs assingham with alacrity yet sheremained for an instant embarrassed as to a further advance idon t understand however how if you ve done nothing an impatience from maggie had checked her i ve not doneabsolutely nothing but what then well she went on after a minute he knows what i ve done it produced on mrs assingham s part her whole tone and mannerexquisitely aiding a hush not less prolonged and the veryduration of which inevitably gave it something of the characterof an equal recognition and what then has he done maggie took again a minute he has been splendid splendid then what more do you want ah what you see said maggie not to be afraid it made her guest again hang fire not to be afraid really tospeak not to be afraid not to speak mrs assingham considered further you can t even to charlotte but as at this after a look at her maggie turned off with amovement of suppressed despair she checked herself and mighthave been watching her for all the difficulty and the pity ofit vaguely moving to the window and the view of the hill street it was almost as if she had had to give up from failure ofresponsive wit in her friend the last failure she had feared the hope of the particular relief she had been working for mrs assingham resumed the next instant however in the very tonethat seemed most to promise her she should have to give upnothing i see i see you would have in that case too manythings to consider it brought the princess round again provingitself thus the note of comprehension she wished most to clutchat don t be afraid maggie took it where she stood which she was soon able tosignify thank you it very properly encouraged her counsellor what your ideaimputes is a criminal intrigue carried on from day to day amidperfect trust and sympathy not only under your eyes but underyour father s that s an idea it s impossible for me for a moment to entertain ah there you are then it s exactly what i wanted from you you re welcome to it mrs assingham breathed you never have entertained it maggie pursued never for an instant said fanny with her head very high maggie took it again yet again as wanting more pardon my beingso horrid but by all you hold sacred mrs assingham faced her ah my dear upon my positive word asan honest woman thank you then said the princess so they remained a little after which but do you believe it love fanny inquired i believe you well as i ve faith in them it comes to the same thing maggie at this last appeared for a moment to think again butshe embraced the proposition the same thing then you re no longer unhappy her guest urged coming moregaily toward her i doubtless shan t be a great while but it was now mrs assingham s turn to want more i veconvinced you it s impossible she had held out her arms and maggie after a moment meetingher threw herself into them with a sound that had its oddity asa sign of relief impossible impossible she emphatically more than emphatically replied yet the next minute she hadburst into tears over the impossibility and a few seconds later pressing clinging sobbing had even caused them to flow audibly sympathetically and perversely from her friend xxxithe understanding appeared to have come to be that the coloneland his wife were to present themselves toward the middle of julyfor the good long visit at fawns on which maggie had obtainedfrom her father that he should genially insist as well as thatthe couple from eaton square should welcome there earlier in themonth and less than a week after their own arrival the adventof the couple from portland place oh we shall give you time tobreathe fanny remarked in reference to the general prospect with a gaiety that announced itself as heedless of criticism toeach member of the party in turn sustaining and bracing herselfby her emphasis pushed even to an amiable cynicism of theconfident view of these punctualities of the assinghams theground she could best occupy to her sense was that of her beingmoved as in this connexion she had always been moved by theadmitted grossness of her avidity the way the hospitality of theververs met her convenience and ministered to her ease destituteas the colonel had kept her from the first of any rusticretreat any leafy bower of her own any fixed base for the staleseason now at hand she had explained at home she had repeatedlyreexplained the terms of her dilemma the real difficulty ofher or as she now put it of their position when the paircould do nothing else in cadogan place they could still talk ofmarvellous little maggie and of the charm the sinister charm of their having to hold their breath to watch her a topic themomentous midnight discussion at which we have been present wasso far from having exhausted it came up irrepressibly at allprivate hours they had planted it there between them and itgrew from day to day in a manner to make their sense ofresponsibility almost yield to their sense of fascination mrs assingham declared at such moments that in the interest of thisadmirable young thing to whom she also declared she had quite come over she was ready to pass with all the world else evenwith the prince himself the object inconsequently as well ofher continued her explicitly shameless appreciation for avulgar indelicate pestilential woman showing her truecharacter in an abandoned old age the colonel s confessedattention had been enlisted we have seen as never yet underpressure from his wife by any guaranteed imbroglio but this she could assure him she perfectly knew was not a bit because hewas sorry for her or touched by what she had let herself in for but because when once they had been opened he couldn t keep hiseyes from resting complacently resting almost intelligently onthe princess if he was in love with her now however so muchthe better it would help them both not to wince at what theywould have to do for her mrs assingham had come back to that whenever he groaned or grunted she had at no beguiled moment since maggie s little march was positively beguiling let himlose sight of the grim necessity awaiting them we shall have as i ve again and again told you to lie for her to lie tillwe re black in the face to lie for her the colonel often at these hours as from avague vision of old chivalry in a new form wandered intoapparent lapses from lucidity to lie to her up and down and in and out it comes to the samething it will consist just as much of lying to the others too to the prince about one s belief in him to charlotte about one sbelief in her to mr verver dear sweet man about one s beliefin everyone so we ve work cut out with the biggest lie on topof all being that we like to be there for such a purpose wehate it unspeakably i m more ready to be a coward before it tolet the whole thing to let everyone selfishly andpusillanimously slide than before any social duty any felthuman call that has ever forced me to be decent i speak atleast for myself for you she had added as i ve given you soperfect an opportunity to fall in love with maggie you lldoubtless find your account in being so much nearer to her and what do you make the colonel could at this alwaysimperturbably enough ask of the account you yourself will findin being so much nearer to the prince of your confirmed if notexasperated infatuation with whom to say nothing of my weakgood nature about it you give such a pretty picture to the picture in question she had been always in fact ablecontemplatively to return the difficulty of my enjoyment ofthat is don t you see that i m making in my loyalty to maggie a sad hash of his affection for me you find means to call it then this whitewashing of his crime being loyal to maggie oh about that particular crime there is always much to say itis always more interesting to us than any other crime it has atleast that for it but of course i call everything i have in mindat all being loyal to maggie being loyal to her is more thananything else helping her with her father which is what shemost wants and needs the colonel had had it before but he could apparently never havetoo much of it helping her with him helping her against him then against what we ve already sofully talked of its having to be recognised between them that hedoubts that s where my part is so plain to see her through tosee her through to the end exaltation for the moment alwayslighted mrs assingham s reference to this plainness yet she atthe same time seldom failed the next instant to qualify herview of it when i talk of my obligation as clear i mean thatit s absolute for just how from day to day and through thickand thin to keep the thing up is i grant you another matter there s one way luckily nevertheless in which i m strong ican perfectly count on her the colonel seldom failed here as from the insidious growth ofan excitement to wonder to encourage not to see you relying to stick to me fast whatever she sees if i stick to her thatis to my own poor struggling way under providence of watchingover them all she ll stand by me to the death she won t give meaway for you know she easily can this regularly was the most lurid turn of their road but bobassingham with each journey met it as for the first time easily she can utterly dishonour me with her father she can let himknow that i was aware at the time of his marriage as i had beenaware at the time of her own of the relations that had pre existed between his wife and her husband and how can she do so if up to this minute by your ownstatement she is herself in ignorance of your knowledge it was a question that mrs assingham had ever for dealing with a manner to which repeated practice had given almost a grandeffect very much as if she was invited by it to say that aboutthis exactly she proposed to do her best lying but she said and with full lucidity something quite other it could giveitself a little the air still of a triumph over his coarseness by acting immediately with the blind resentment with which inher place ninety nine women out of a hundred would act and byso making mr verver in turn act with the same natural passion the passion of ninety nine men out of a hundred they ve only toagree about me the poor lady said they ve only to feel at oneover it feel bitterly practised upon cheated and injured they ve only to denounce me to each other as false and infamous for me to be quite irretrievably dished of course it s i whohave been and who continue to be cheated cheated by the princeand charlotte but they re not obliged to give me the benefit ofthat or to give either of us the benefit of anything they ll bewithin their rights to lump us all together as a false cruel conspiring crew and if they can find the right facts to supportthem get rid of us root and branch this on each occasion put the matter so at the worst thatrepetition even scarce controlled the hot flush with which shewas compelled to see the parts of the whole history all its uglyconsistency and its temporary gloss hang together she enjoyed invariably the sense of making her danger present of making itreal to her husband and of his almost turning pale when theireyes met at this possibility of their compromised state andtheir shared discredit the beauty was that as under a touch ofone of the ivory notes at the left of the keyboard he soundedout with the short sharpness of the dear fond stupid uneasy man conspiring so far as you were concerned to what end why to the obvious end of getting the prince a wife atmaggie s expense and then to that of getting charlotte a husbandat mr verver s of rendering friendly services yes which have produced as itturns out complications but from the moment you didn t do itfor the complications why shouldn t you have rendered them it was extraordinary for her always in this connexion how with time given him he fell to speaking better for her than shecould in the presence of her clear cut image of the worst speak for herself troubled as she was she thus never whollyfailed of her amusement by the way oh isn t what i may havemeddled for so far as it can be proved i did meddle open tointerpretation by which i mean to mr verver s and maggie s mayn t they see my motive in the light of that appreciation asthe wish to be decidedly more friendly to the others than to thevictimised father and daughter she positively liked to keep itup mayn t they see my motive as the determination to serve theprince in any case and at any price first to place himcomfortably in other words to find him his fill of money mayn tit have all the air for them of a really equivocal sinisterbargain between us something quite unholy and louche it produced in the poor colonel infallibly the echo louche love why haven t you said as much yourself haven t you put yourfinger on that awful possibility she had a way now with his felicities that made him enjoy beingreminded of them in speaking of your having always had such a mash such a mash precisely for the man i was to help to put sosplendidly at his ease a motherly mash an impartial look at itwould show it only as likely to have been but we re not talking of course about impartial looks we re talking of good innocentpeople deeply worked upon by a horrid discovery and going muchfurther in their view of the lurid as such people almost alwaysdo than those who have been wider awake all round from thefirst what i was to have got from my friend in such a view inexchange for what i had been able to do for him well that wouldhave been an equivalent of a kind best known to myself for meshrewdly to consider and she easily lost herself each time inthe anxious satisfaction of filling out the picture it wouldhave been seen it would have been heard of before the case ofthe woman a man doesn t want or of whom he s tired or for whomhe has no use but such uses and who is capable in herinfatuation in her passion of promoting his interests withother women rather than lose sight of him lose touch of him cease to have to do with him at all cela s est vu my dear andstranger things still as i needn t tell you very good then she wound up there is a perfectly possible conception of thebehaviour of your sweet wife since as i say there s noimagination so lively once it s started as that of reallyagitated lambs lions are nothing to them for lions aresophisticated are blases are brought up from the first toprowling and mauling it does give us you ll admit something tothink about my relief is luckily however in what i finally dothink he was well enough aware by this time of what she finally didthink but he was not without a sense again also for hisamusement by the way it would have made him for a spectator ofthese passages between the pair resemble not a little theartless child who hears his favourite story told for thetwentieth time and enjoys it exactly because he knows what isnext to happen what of course will pull them up if they turnout to have less imagination than you assume is the profit youcan have found in furthering mrs verver s marriage you weren tat least in love with charlotte oh mrs assingham at this always brought out my hand inthat is easily accounted for by my desire to be agreeable tohim to mr verver to the prince by preventing her in that way from taking as hewas in danger of seeing her do some husband with whom hewouldn t be able to open to keep open so large an account aswith his father in law i ve brought her near him kept herwithin his reach as she could never have remained either as asingle woman or as the wife of a different man kept her on that sweet construction to be his mistress kept her on that sweet construction to be his mistress shebrought it out grandly it had always so for her own ear as wellas visibly for her husband s its effect the facilities inthe case thanks to the particular conditions being so quiteideal down even to the facility of your minding everything so little from your own point of view as to have supplied him with theenjoyment of two beautiful women down even to that to the monstrosity of my folly but not mrs assingham added two of anything one beautiful woman and one beautiful fortune that s what a creature of pure virtueexposes herself to when she suffers her pure virtue suffers hersympathy her disinterestedness her exquisite sense for thelives of others to carry her too far voila i see it s the way the ververs have you it s the way the ververs have me it s in other words the waythey would be able to make such a show to each other of havingme if maggie weren t so divine she lets you off he never failed to insist on all this to thevery end which was how he had become so versed in what shefinally thought she lets me off so that now horrified and contrite at whati ve done i may work to help her out and mr verver she wasfond of adding lets me off too then you do believe he knows it determined in her always there with a significant pause adeep immersion in her thought i believe he would let me off ifhe did know so that i might work to help him out or rather really she went on that i might work to help maggie thatwould be his motive that would be his condition in forgivingme just as hers for me in fact her motive and her condition are my acting to spare her father but it s with maggie only thati m directly concerned nothing ever not a breath not a look i ll guarantee shall i have whatever happens from mr ververhimself so it is therefore that i shall probably by theclosest possible shave escape the penalty of my crimes you mean being held responsible i mean being held responsible my advantage will be thatmaggie s such a trump such a trump that as you say she ll stick to you stick to me on our understanding stick to me for ourunderstanding s signed and sealed and to brood over it againwas ever for mrs assingham to break out again with exaltation it s a grand high compact she has solemnly promised but in words oh yes in words enough since it s a matter of words to keepup her lie so long as i keep up mine and what do you call her lie why the pretence that she believes me believes they reinnocent she positively believes then they re guilty she has arrived atthat she s really content with it in the absence of proof it was here each time that fanny assingham most faltered butalways at last to get the matter for her own sense and with along sigh sufficiently straight it isn t a question of beliefor of proof absent or present it s inevitably with her aquestion of natural perception of insurmountable feeling sheirresistibly knows that there s something between them but shehasn t arrived at it as you say at all that s exactly whatshe hasn t done what she so steadily and intensely refuses todo she stands off and off so as not to arrive she keeps out tosea and away from the rocks and what she most wants of me is tokeep at a safe distance with her as i for my own skin only asknot to come nearer after which invariably she let him have itall so far from wanting proof which she must get in a manner by my siding with her she wants disproof as against herself and has appealed to me so extraordinarily to side against her it s really magnificent when you come to think of it the spiritof her appeal if i ll but cover them up brazenly enough theothers so as to show round and about them as happy as a bird she on her side will do what she can if i ll keep them quiet ina word it will enable her to gain time time as against any ideaof her father s and so somehow come out if i ll take care ofcharlotte in particular she ll take care of the prince andit s beautiful and wonderful really pathetic and exquisite tosee what she feels that time may do for her ah but what does she call poor little thing time well this summer at fawns to begin with she can live as yet of course but from hand to mouth but she has worked it out forherself i think that the very danger of fawns superficiallylooked at may practically amount to a greater protection therethe lovers if they are lovers will have to mind they ll feelit for themselves unless things are too utterly far gone withthem and things are not too utterly far gone with them she had inevitably poor woman her hesitation for this but sheput down her answer as for the purchase of some absolutelyindispensable article she would have put down her last shilling no it made him always grin at her is that a lie do you think you re worth lying to if it weren t the truth forme she added i wouldn t have accepted for fawns i can ibelieve keep the wretches quiet but how at the worst oh the worst don t talk about the worst i can keep themquiet at the best i seem to feel simply by our being there itwill work from week to week of itself you ll see he was willing enough to see but he desired to provide yetif it doesn t work ah that s talking about the worst well it might be but what were they doing from morning tonight at this crisis but talk who ll keep the others the others who ll keep them quiet if your couple have had a life together they can t have had it completely without witnesses without thehelp of persons however few who must have some knowledge someidea about them they ve had to meet secretly protectedly they ve had to arrange for if they haven t met and haven tarranged and haven t thereby in some quarter or other had togive themselves away why are we piling it up so therefore ifthere s evidence up and down london there must be people in possession of it ah it isn t all shealways remembered up and down london some of it must connectthem i mean she musingly added it naturally would withother places with who knows what strange adventures opportunities dissimulations but whatever there may have been it will also all have been buried on the spot oh they ve knownhow too beautifully but nothing all the same is likely tofind its way to maggie of itself because every one who may have anything to tell you hold willhave been so squared and then inveterately before she couldsay he enjoyed so much coming to this what will have squaredlady castledean the consciousness she had never lost her promptness ofhaving no stones to throw at any one else s windows she hasenough to do to guard her own glass that was what she wasdoing fanny said that last morning at matcham when all of uswent off and she kept the prince and charlotte over she helpedthem simply that she might herself be helped if it wasn tperhaps rather with her ridiculous mr blint that he might be they put in together therefore of course that day they got itclear and quite under her eyes inasmuch as they didn t becometraceable again as we know till late in the evening on thishistoric circumstance mrs assingham was always ready afresh tobrood but she was no less ready after her brooding devoutly toadd only we know nothing whatever else for which all our starsbe thanked the colonel s gratitude was apt to be less marked what did theydo for themselves all the same from the moment they got thatfree hand to the moment long after dinner time haven t you toldme of their turning up at their respective homes well it s none of your business i don t speak of it as mine but it s only too much theirs people are always traceable in england when tracings arerequired something sooner or later happens somebody sooneror later breaks the holy calm murder will out murder will but this isn t murder quite the contrary perhaps i verily believe she had her moments of adding that for theamusement of the row you would prefer an explosion this however was a remark he seldom noticed he wound up forthe most part after a long contemplative smoke with atransition from which no exposed futility in it had succeeded inweaning him what i can t for my life make out is your idea ofthe old boy charlotte s too inconceivably funny husband i have no idea i beg your pardon you ve just shown it you never speak of himbut as too inconceivably funny well he is she always confessed that is he may be for alli know too inconceivably great but that s not an idea itrepresents only my weak necessity of feeling that he s beyondme which isn t an idea either you see he may be stupid too precisely there you are yet on the other hand she always went on he may be sublime sublimer even than maggie herself he may in fact have alreadybeen but we shall never know with which her tone betrayedperhaps a shade of soreness for the single exemption she didn tyearningly welcome that i can see oh i say it came to affect the colonel himself with a senseof privation i m not sure even that charlotte will oh my dear what charlotte doesn t know but she brooded and brooded i m not sure even that the princewill it seemed privation in short for them all they ll bemystified confounded tormented but they won t know and alltheir possible putting their heads together won t make them that said fanny assingham will be their punishment and sheended ever when she had come so far at the same pitch itwill probably also if i get off with so little be mine and what her husband liked to ask will be mine nothing you re not worthy of any one s punishment is in whatone feels and what will make ours effective is that we shallfeel she was splendid with her ours she flared up with thisprophecy it will be maggie herself who will mete it out maggie she ll know about her father everything everything sherepeated on the vision of which each time mrs assingham aswith the presentiment of an odd despair turned away from it but she ll never tell us xxxiiif maggie had not so firmly made up her mind never to say eitherto her good friend or to any one else more than she meant abouther father she might have found herself betrayed into some suchoverflow during the week spent in london with her husband afterthe others had adjourned to fawns for the summer this wasbecause of the odd element of the unnatural imparted to the sosimple fact of their brief separation by the assumptions residentin their course of life hitherto she was used herself certainly by this time to dealing with odd elements but shedropped instantly even from such peace as she had patched up when it was a question of feeling that her unpenetrated parentmight be alone with them she thought of him as alone with themwhen she thought of him as alone with charlotte and this strangely enough even while fixing her sense to the full on hiswife s power of preserving quite of enhancing every felicitousappearance charlotte had done that under immeasurably fewerdifficulties indeed during the numerous months of their hymenealabsence from england the period prior to that wonderful reunionof the couples in the interest of the larger play of all thevirtues of each which was now bearing for mrs verver sstepdaughter at least such remarkable fruit it was the presentso much briefer interval in a situation possibly in a relation so changed it was the new terms of her problem that would taxcharlotte s art the princess could pull herself up repeatedly by remembering that the real relation between her father andhis wife was a thing that she knew nothing about and that instrictness was none of her business but she none the lessfailed to keep quiet as she would have called it before theprojected image of their ostensibly happy isolation nothingcould have had less of the quality of quietude than a certainqueer wish that fitfully flickered up in her a wish thatusurped perversely the place of a much more natural one ifcharlotte while she was about it could only have been worse that idea maggie fell to invoking instead of the idea that shemight desirably have been better for exceedingly odd as it wasto feel in such ways she believed she mightn t have worried somuch if she didn t somehow make her stepmother out under thebeautiful trees and among the dear old gardens as lavish offifty kinds of confidence and twenty kinds at least ofgentleness gentleness and confidence were certainly the rightthing as from a charming woman to her husband but the finetissue of reassurance woven by this lady s hands and flung overher companion as a light muffling veil formed precisely awrought transparency through which she felt her father s eyescontinually rest on herself the reach of his gaze came to herstraighter from a distance it showed him as still moreconscious down there alone of the suspected the feltelaboration of the process of their not alarming or hurting him she had herself now for weeks and weeks and all unwinkingly traced the extension of this pious effort but her perfectsuccess in giving no sign she did herself that credit wouldhave been an achievement quite wasted if mrs verver should makewith him those mistakes of proportion one set of them tooabruptly too incoherently designed to correct another set thatshe had made with his daughter however if she had been worse poor woman who should say that her husband would to acertainty have been better one groped noiselessly among such questions and it was actuallynot even definite for the princess that her own amerigo leftalone with her in town had arrived at the golden mean ofnon precautionary gallantry which would tend by his calculation to brush private criticism from its last perching place thetruth was in this connection that she had different sorts ofterrors and there were hours when it came to her that these dayswere a prolonged repetition of that night drive of weeks before from the other house to their own when he had tried to charmher by his sovereign personal power into some collapse thatwould commit her to a repudiation of consistency she was neveralone with him it was to be said without her having sooner orlater to ask herself what had already become of her consistency yet at the same time so long as she breathed no charge shekept hold of a remnant of appearance that could save her fromattack attack real attack from him as he would conduct itwas what she above all dreaded she was so far from sure thatunder that experience she mightn t drop into some depth ofweakness mightn t show him some shortest way with her that hewould know how to use again therefore since she had given him as yet no moment s pretext for pretending to her that she hadeither lost faith or suffered by a feather s weight in happiness she left him it was easy to reason with an immense advantagefor all waiting and all tension she wished him for the present to make up to her for nothing who could say to what making upmight lead into what consenting or pretending or destroyingblindness it might plunge her she loved him too helplessly still to dare to open the door by an inch to his treating heras if either of them had wronged the other something orsomebody and who at this which of them all would inevitably would in the gust of momentary selfishness be sacrificed tothat whereas what she intelligently needed was to know where shewas going knowledge knowledge was a fascination as well as afear and a part precisely of the strangeness of this juncturewas the way her apprehension that he would break out to her withsome merely general profession was mixed with her dire need toforgive him to reassure him to respond to him on no groundthat she didn t fully measure to do these things it must beclear to her what they were for but to act in that light was bythe same effect to learn horribly what the other things hadbeen he might tell her only what he wanted only what would workupon her by the beauty of his appeal and the result of thedirect appeal of any beauty in him would be her helplesssubmission to his terms all her temporary safety her hand to mouth success accordingly was in his neither perceiving nordivining this thanks to such means as she could take to preventhim take literally from hour to hour during these days of moreunbroken exposure from hour to hour she fairly expected somesign of his having decided on a jump ah yes it has been as youthink i ve strayed away i ve fancied myself free given myselfin other quantities with larger generosities because i thoughtyou were different different from what i now see but it wasonly only because i didn t know and you must admit that yougave me scarce reason enough reason enough i mean to keepclear of my mistake to which i confess for which i ll doexquisite penance which you can help me now i too beautifullyfeel to get completely over that was what while she watched herself she potentially heardhim bring out and while she carried to an end another day another sequence and yet another of their hours together withouthis producing it she felt herself occupied with him beyond eventhe intensity of surrender she was keeping her head for areason for a cause and the labour of this detachment with thelabour of her keeping the pitch of it down held them together inthe steel hoop of an intimacy compared with which artless passionwould have been but a beating of the air her greatest danger orat least her greatest motive for care was the obsession of thethought that if he actually did suspect the fruit of hisattention to her couldn t help being a sense of the growth of herimportance taking the measure with him as she had taken itwith her father of the prescribed reach of her hypocrisy shesaw how it would have to stretch even to her seeking to provethat she was not all the same important a single touch fromhim oh she should know it in case of its coming any brush ofhis hand of his lips of his voice inspired by recognition ofher probable interest as distinct from pity for her virtualgloom would hand her over to him bound hand and foot thereforeto be free to be free to act other than abjectly for herfather she must conceal from him the validity that like amicroscopic insect pushing a grain of sand she was taking oneven for herself she could keep it up with a change in sight but she couldn t keep it up forever so that really oneextraordinary effect of their week of untempered confrontation which bristled with new marks was to make her reach out inthought to their customary companions and calculate the kind ofrelief that rejoining them would bring she was learning almostfrom minute to minute to be a mistress of shades since always when there were possibilities enough of intimacy there were also by that fact in intercourse possibilities of iridescence but she was working against an adversary who was a master ofshades too and on whom if she didn t look out she shouldpresently have imposed a consciousness of the nature of theirstruggle to feel him in fact to think of his feeling himself her adversary in things of this fineness to see him at all inshort brave a name that would represent him as in opposition was already to be nearly reduced to a visible smotheringof her cry of alarm should he guess they were having in theirso occult manner a high fight and that it was she all thewhile in her supposed stupidity who had made it high and waskeeping it high in the event of his doing this before they couldleave town she should verily be lost the possible respite for her at fawns would come from the factthat observation in him there would inevitably find some ofits directness diverted this would be the case if only becausethe remarkable strain of her father s placidity might be thoughtof as likely to claim some larger part of his attention besideswhich there would be always charlotte herself to draw him off charlotte would help him again doubtless to study anything right or left that might be symptomatic but maggie could seethat this very fact might perhaps contribute in its degree toprotect the secret of her own fermentation it is not evenincredible that she may have discovered the gleam of a comfortthat was to broaden in the conceivable effect on the prince sspirit on his nerves on his finer irritability of some of thevery airs and aspects the light graces themselves of mrs verver s too perfect competence what it would most come to after all she said to herself was a renewal for him of theprivilege of watching that lady watch her very well then withthe elements after all so mixed in him how long would he go onenjoying mere spectatorship of that act for she had by this timemade up her mind that in charlotte s company he deferred tocharlotte s easier art of mounting guard wouldn t he get tired to put it only at that of seeing her always on the rampart erect and elegant with her lace flounced parasol now folded andnow shouldered march to and fro against a gold coloured east orwest maggie had gone far truly for a view of the question ofthis particular reaction and she was not incapable of pullingherself up with the rebuke that she counted her chickens beforethey were hatched how sure she should have to be of so manythings before she might thus find a weariness in amerigo sexpression and a logic in his weariness one of her dissimulated arts for meeting their tension meanwhile was to interweave mrs assingham as plausibly aspossible with the undulations of their surface to bring it aboutthat she should join them of an afternoon when they drovetogether or if they went to look at things looking at thingsbeing almost as much a feature of their life as if they werebazaar opening royalties then there were such combinations later in the day as her attendance on them and the colonel s aswell for such whimsical matters as visits to the opera no matterwho was singing and sudden outbreaks of curiosity about thebritish drama the good couple from cadogan place could alwaysunprotestingly dine with them and go on afterwards to suchpublicities as the princess cultivated the boldness of nowperversely preferring it may be said of her that during thesepassages she plucked her sensations by the way detached nervously the small wild blossoms of her dim forest so that shecould smile over them at least with the spacious appearance forher companions for her husband above all of bravely ofaltogether frivolously going a maying she had her intense hersmothered excitements some of which were almost inspirations she had in particular the extravagant positively at moments theamused sense of using her friend to the topmost notch accompanied with the high luxury of not having to explain never no never should she have to explain to fanny assingham again who poor woman on her own side would be charged it might beforever with that privilege of the higher ingenuity she put itall off on fanny and the dear thing herself might henceforthappraise the quantity more and more magnificent now in herblameless egoism maggie asked no questions of her and thus onlysignified the greatness of the opportunity she gave her shedidn t care for what devotions what dinners of their own theassinghams might have been booked that was a detail and shecould think without wincing of the ruptures and rearrangements towhich her service condemned them it all fell in beautifully moreover so that as hard at this time in spite of her fever as a little pointed diamond the princess showed something of theglitter of consciously possessing the constructive the creativehand she had but to have the fancy of presenting herself ofpresenting her husband in a certain high and convenient manner to make it natural they should go about with their gentleman andtheir lady to what else but this exactly had charlotte duringso many weeks of the earlier season worked her up herselfassuming and discharging so far as might be the character andoffice of one of those revolving subordinate presences that floatin the wake of greatness the precedent was therefore established and the group normallyconstituted mrs assingham meanwhile at table on the stairs in the carriage or the opera box might with her constantoverflow of expression for that matter and its singularlyresident character where men in especial were concerned lookacross at amerigo in whatever sense she liked it was not of thatmaggie proposed to be afraid she might warn him she mightrebuke him she might reassure him she might if it wereimpossible not to absolutely make love to him even this wasopen to her as a matter simply between them if it would helpher to answer for the impeccability he had guaranteed and maggiedesired in fact only to strike her as acknowledging the efficacyof her aid when she mentioned to her one evening a smallproject for the morrow privately entertained the idea irresistible intense of going to pay at the museum a visit tomr crichton mr crichton as mrs assingham could easilyremember was the most accomplished and obliging of publicfunctionaries whom every one knew and who knew every one whohad from the first in particular lent himself freely and forthe love of art and history to becoming one of the steadierlights of mr verver s adventurous path the custodian of one ofthe richest departments of the great national collection ofprecious things he could feel for the sincere private collectorand urge him on his way even when condemned to be present at hiscapture of trophies sacrificed by the country to parliamentarythrift he carried his amiability to the point of saying that since london under pettifogging views had to miss from time totime its rarest opportunities he was almost consoled to seesuch lost causes invariably wander at last one by one with thetormenting tinkle of their silver bells into the wondrous thealready famous fold beyond the mississippi there was a charm inhis almosts that was not to be resisted especially after mr verver and maggie had grown sure or almost again of enjoyingthe monopoly of them and on this basis of envy changed tosympathy by the more familiar view of the father and thedaughter mr crichton had at both houses though especially ineaton square learned to fill out the responsive and suggestivecharacter it was at his invitation fanny well recalled thatmaggie one day long before and under her own attendanceprecisely had for the glory of the name she bore paid a visitto one of the ampler shrines of the supreme exhibitory temple analcove of shelves charged with the gold and brown gold and ivory of old italian bindings and consecrated to the records ofthe prince s race it had been an impression that penetrated that remained yet maggie had sighed ever so prettily at itshaving to be so superficial she was to go back some day to divedeeper to linger and taste in spite of which however mrs assingham could not recollect perceiving that the visit had beenrepeated this second occasion had given way for a long time inher happy life to other occasions all testifying in theirdegree to the quality of her husband s blood its rich mixtureand its many remarkable references after which no doubt thecharming piety involved had grown on still further grounds bewildered and faint it now appeared none the less that some renewed conversationwith mr crichton had breathed on the faintness revivingly andmaggie mentioned her purpose as a conception of her very own tothe success of which she designed to devote her morning visitsof gracious ladies under his protection lighted up rosily forthis perhaps most flower loving and honey sipping member of thegreat bloomsbury hive its packed passages and cells and thoughnot sworn of the province toward which his friend had foundherself according to her appeal to him yearning again nothingwas easier for him than to put her in relation with the presidingurbanities so it had been settled maggie said to mrs assingham and she was to dispense with amerigo s company fannywas to remember later on that she had at first taken this lastfact for one of the finer notes of her young woman s detachment imagined she must be going alone because of the shade of ironythat in these ambiguous days her husband s personal presencemight be felt to confer practically on any tribute to histransmitted significance then as the next moment she felt itclear that so much plotted freedom was virtually a refinement ofreflection an impulse to commemorate afresh whatever might stillsurvive of pride and hope her sense of ambiguity happily felland she congratulated her companion on having anything soexquisite to do and on being so exquisitely in the humour to doit after the occasion had come and gone she was confirmed in heroptimism she made out in the evening that the hour spent amongthe projected lights the annals and illustrations theparchments and portraits the emblazoned volumes and the murmuredcommentary had been for the princess enlarging and inspiring maggie had said to her some days before very sweetly but veryfirmly invite us to dine please for friday and have any oneyou like or you can it doesn t in the least matter whom andthe pair in cadogan place had bent to this mandate with adocility not in the least ruffled by all that it took forgranted it provided for an evening this had been maggie s view and shelived up to her view in her friend s eyes by treating theoccasion more or less explicitly as new and strange the goodassinghams had feasted in fact at the two other boards on a scaleso disproportionate to the scant solicitations of their own thatit was easy to make a joke of seeing how they fed at home howthey met themselves the question of giving to eat maggie dinedwith them in short and arrived at making her husband appear todine much in the manner of a pair of young sovereigns who have in the frolic humour of the golden years of reigns proposedthemselves to a pair of faithfully serving subjects she showedan interest in their arrangements an inquiring tenderness almostfor their economies so that her hostess not unnaturally as theymight have said put it all down the tone and the freedom ofwhich she set the example to the effect wrought in her afresh byone of the lessons learned in the morning at the altar of thepast hadn t she picked it up from an anecdote or two offeredagain to her attention that there were for princesses of such aline more ways than one of being a heroine maggie s wayto night was to surprise them all truly by the extravagance ofher affability she was doubtless not positively boisterous yet though mrs assingham as a bland critic had never doubted herbeing graceful she had never seen her put so much of it intobeing what might have been called assertive it was all a tune towhich fanny s heart could privately palpitate her guest washappy happy as a consequence of something that had occurred butshe was making the prince not lose a ripple of her laugh thoughnot perhaps always enabling him to find it absolutely notfoolish foolish in public beyond a certain point he wasscarce the man to brook his wife s being thought to be so thatthere hovered before their friend the possibility of somesubsequent scene between them in the carriage or at home ofslightly sarcastic inquiry of promptly invited explanation ascene that according as maggie should play her part in it mightor might not precipitate developments what made theseappearances practically thrilling meanwhile was this mystery amystery it was clear to amerigo himself of the incident or theinfluence that had so peculiarly determined them the lady of cadogan place was to read deeper however withinthree days and the page was turned for her on the eve of heryoung confidant s leaving london the awaited migration to fawnswas to take place on the morrow and it was known meanwhile tomrs assingham that their party of four were to dine that night at the american embassy with another and a larger party so thatthe elder woman had a sense of surprise on receiving from theyounger under date of six o clock a telegram requesting herimmediate attendance please come to me at once dress early ifnecessary so that we shall have time the carriage ordered forus will take you back first mrs assingham on quickdeliberation dressed though not perhaps with full lucidity andby seven o clock was in portland place where her friend upstairs and described to her on her arrival as herself engagedin dressing instantly received her she knew on the spot poorfanny as she was afterwards to declare to the colonel that herfeared crisis had popped up as at the touch of a spring that herimpossible hour was before her her impossible hour was the hourof its coming out that she had known of old so much more than shehad ever said and she had often put it to herself inapprehension she tried to think even in preparation that sheshould recognise the approach of her doom by a consciousness akinto that of the blowing open of a window on some night of thehighest wind and the lowest thermometer it would be all in vainto have crouched so long by the fire the glass would have beensmashed the icy air would fill the place if the air in maggie sroom then on her going up was not as yet quite the polarblast she had expected it was distinctly none the less such anatmosphere as they had not hitherto breathed together theprincess she perceived was completely dressed that businesswas over it added indeed to the effect of her importantlyawaiting the assistance she had summoned of her showing a deckcleared so to speak for action her maid had already left her and she presented herself in the large clear room whereeverything was admirable but where nothing was out of place as for the first time in her life rather bedizened was it thatshe had put on too many things overcharged herself with jewels wore in particular more of them than usual and bigger ones inher hair a question her visitor presently answered byattributing this appearance largely to the bright red spot redas some monstrous ruby that burned in either of her cheeks these two items of her aspect had promptly enough their ownlight for mrs assingham who made out by it that nothing morepathetic could be imagined than the refuge and disguise heragitation had instinctively asked of the arts of dress multiplied to extravagance almost to incoherence she had had visibly her idea that of not betraying herself by inattentionsinto which she had never yet fallen and she stood there circledabout and furnished forth as always in a manner that testifiedto her perfect little personal processes it had ever been hersign that she was for all occasions found ready without looseends or exposed accessories or unremoved superfluities asuggestion of the swept and garnished in her whole splendid yetthereby more or less encumbered and embroidered setting thatreflected her small still passion for order and symmetry forobjects with their backs to the walls and spoke even of someprobable reference in her american blood to dusting andpolishing new england grandmothers if her apartment was princely in the clearness of the lingering day she looked asif she had been carried there prepared all attired anddecorated like some holy image in a procession and left precisely to show what wonder she could work under pressure herfriend felt how could she not as the truly pious priest mightfeel when confronted behind the altar before the festa withhis miraculous madonna such an occasion would be grave ingeneral with all the gravity of what he might look for but thegravity to night would be of the rarest what he might look forwould depend so on what he could give xxxiii something very strange has happened and i think you ought toknow it maggie spoke this indeed without extravagance yet with theeffect of making her guest measure anew the force of her appeal it was their definite understanding whatever fanny knew fanny sfaith would provide for and she knew accordingly at the end offive minutes what the extraordinary in the late occurrence hadconsisted of and how it had all come of maggie s achieved hour under mr crichton s protection at the museum he had desired mr crichton with characteristic kindness after the wonderfulshow after offered luncheon at his incorporated lodge hard by to see her safely home especially on his noting in attendingher to the great steps that she had dismissed her carriage which she had done really just for the harmless amusement oftaking her way alone she had known she should find herself asthe consequence of such an hour in a sort of exalted state under the influence of which a walk through the london streetswould be exactly what would suit her best an independent ramble impressed excited contented with nothing to mind and nobody totalk to and shop windows in plenty to look at if she liked alow taste of the essence it was to be supposed of her nature that she had of late for so many reasons been unable togratify she had taken her leave with her thanks she knew herway quite enough it being also sufficiently the case that shehad even a shy hope of not going too straight to wander a littlewild was what would truly amuse her so that keeping clear ofoxford street and cultivating an impression as of parts shedidn t know she had ended with what she had more or less hadbeen fancying an encounter with three or four shops an oldbookseller s an old printmonger s a couple of places with dimantiquities in the window that were not as so many of the othershops those in sloane street say a hollow parade which hadlong since ceased to beguile there had remained with hermoreover an allusion of charlotte s of some months before seeddropped into her imagination in the form of a casual speech aboutthere being in bloomsbury such funny little fascinating placesand even sometimes such unexpected finds there could perhapshave been no stronger mark than this sense of well nigh romanticopportunity no livelier sign of the impression made on her andalways so long retained so watchfully nursed by any observationof charlotte s however lightly thrown off and then she hadfelt somehow more at her ease than for months and monthsbefore she didn t know why but her time at the museum oddly had done it it was as if she hadn t come into so many noble andbeautiful associations nor secured them also for her boy secured them even for her father only to see them turn to vanityand doubt turn possibly to something still worse i believed inhim again as much as ever and i felt how i believed in him shesaid with bright fixed eyes i felt it in the streets as iwalked along and it was as if that helped me and lifted me up my being off by myself there not having for the moment towonder and watch having on the contrary almost nothing on mymind it was so much as if everything would come out right that she hadfallen to thinking of her father s birthday had given herselfthis as a reason for trying what she could pick up for it theywould keep it at fawns where they had kept it before since itwould be the twenty first of the month and she mightn t haveanother chance of making sure of something to offer him therewas always the impossibility of course of finding him anything the least bit good that he wouldn t already long ago in hisrummagings have seen himself and only not to think a quartergood enough this however was an old story and one could nothave had any fun with him but for his sweet theory that theindividual gift the friendship s offering was by a rigorouslaw of nature a foredoomed aberration and that the more it wasso the more it showed and the more one cherished it for showing how friendly it had been the infirmity of art was the candour ofaffection the grossness of pedigree the refinement of sympathy the ugliest objects in fact as a general thing were thebravest the tenderest mementos and as such figured in glasscases apart worthy doubtless of the home but not worthy of thetemple dedicated to the grimacing not to the clear faced gods she herself naturally through the past years had come to bemuch represented in those receptacles against the thick lockedpanes of which she still liked to flatten her nose finding inits place each time everything she had on successiveanniversaries tried to believe he might pretend at hersuggestion to be put off with or at least think curious shewas now ready to try it again they had always with his pleasurein her pretence and her pleasure in his with the funny betrayalof the sacrifice to domestic manners on either side played thegame so happily to this end on her way home she had loiteredeverywhere quite too deludedly among the old books and the oldprints which had yielded nothing to her purpose but with astrange inconsequence in one of the other shops that of a smallantiquarian a queer little foreign man who had shown her anumber of things shown her finally something that struck withit as rather a rarity and thinking it would compared to some ofher ventures quite superlatively do she had bought boughtreally when it came to that for a price it appears now itwon t do at all said maggie something has happened since thatputs it quite out of the question i had only my day ofsatisfaction in it but i feel at the same time as i keep ithere before me that i wouldn t have missed it for the world she had talked from the first of her friend s entrancescoherently enough even with a small quaver that overstated hercalm but she held her breath every few seconds as if fordeliberation and to prove she didn t pant all of which markedfor fanny the depth of her commotion her reference to herthought about her father about her chance to pick up somethingthat might divert him her mention in fine of his fortitudeunder presents having meanwhile naturally it should be said much less an amplitude of insistence on the speaker s lips than apower to produce on the part of the listener herself the promptresponse and full comprehension of memory and sympathy of oldamused observation the picture was filled out by the latter sfond fancy but maggie was at any rate under arms she knew whatshe was doing and had already her plan a plan for making forallowing as yet no difference in accordance with which shewould still dine out and not with red eyes nor convulsedfeatures nor neglected items of appearance nor anything thatwould raise a question yet there was some knowledge that exactly to this support of her not breaking down she desired she required possession of and with the sinister rise and fallof lightning unaccompanied by thunder it played before mrs assingham s eyes that she herself should have at whatever riskor whatever cost to supply her with the stuff of her need allour friend s instinct was to hold off from this till she shouldsee what the ground would bear she would take no step nearerunless intelligibly to meet her and awkward though it might beto hover there only pale and distorted with mere imbecilities ofvagueness there was a quality of bald help in the fact of not asyet guessing what such an ominous start could lead to shecaught however after a second s thought at the princess sallusion to her lost reassurance you mean you were so at your ease on monday the night you dinedwith us i was very happy then said maggie yes we thought you so gay and so brilliant fanny felt itfeeble but she went on we were so glad you were happy maggie stood a moment at first only looking at her you thoughtme all right eh surely dearest we thought you all right well i daresay it was natural but in point of fact i never wasmore wrong in my life for all the while if you please thiswas brewing mrs assingham indulged as nearly as possible to luxury hervagueness this that replied the princess whose eyes her companion now saw had turned to an object on the chimney piece of the room ofwhich among so many precious objects the ververs wherever theymight be always revelled peculiarly in matchless old mantelornaments her visitor had not taken heed do you mean the gilt cup i mean the gilt cup the piece now recognised by fanny as new to her own vision was acapacious bowl of old looking rather strikingly yellow gold mounted by a short stem on an ample foot which held a centralposition above the fire place where to allow it the better toshow a clearance had been made of other objects notably of thelouis seize clock that accompanied the candelabra this lattertrophy ticked at present on the marble slab of a commode thatexactly matched it in splendour and style mrs assingham tookit the bowl as a fine thing but the question was obviously notof its intrinsic value and she kept off from it admiring it ata distance but what has that to do it has everything you ll see with which again however forthe moment maggie attached to her strange wide eyes he knewher before before i had ever seen him he knew but fanny while she cast about her for the linksshe missed could only echo it amerigo knew charlotte more than i ever dreamed fanny felt then it was stare for stare but surely you alwaysknew they had met i didn t understand i knew too little don t you see what imean the princess asked mrs assingham wondered during these instants how much she evennow knew it had taken a minute to perceive how gently she wasspeaking with that perception of its being no challenge ofwrath no heat of the deceived soul but only a free exposure ofthe completeness of past ignorance inviting derision even if itmust the elder woman felt first a strange barely crediblerelief she drew in as if it had been the warm summer scent of aflower the sweet certainty of not meeting any way she shouldturn any consequence of judgment she shouldn t be judged saveby herself which was her own wretched business the next moment however at all events she blushed within for her immediatecowardice she had thought of herself thought of getting off before so much as thinking that is of pitifully seeing that shewas in presence of an appeal that was all an appeal that utterlyaccepted its necessity in a general way dear child yes butnot a in connexion with what you ve been telling me they were intimate you see intimate said the princess fanny continued to face her taking from her excited eyes thishistory so dim and faint for all her anxious emphasis of thefar away other time there s always the question of what oneconsiders what one considers intimate well i know what i considerintimate now too intimate said maggie to let me knowanything about it it was quiet yes but not too quiet for fanny assingham scapacity to wince only compatible with letting me you mean she had asked it after a pause but turning again to the newornament of the chimney and wondering even while she took relieffrom it at this gap in her experience but here are things mydear of which my ignorance is perfect they went about together they re known to have done it and idon t mean only before i mean after after said fanny assingham before we were married yes but after we were engaged ah i ve known nothing about that and she said it with abraver assurance clutching with comfort at something that wasapparently new to her that bowl maggie went on is so strangely too strangely almost to believe at this time of day the proof they weretogether all the while up to the very eve of our marriage don tyou remember how just before that she came back so unexpectedly from america the question had for mrs assingham and whether all consciouslyor not the oddest pathos of simplicity oh yes dear of coursei remember how she came back from america and how she stayedwith us and what view one had of it maggie s eyes still all the time pressed and penetrated sothat during a moment just here she might have given the littleflare have made the little pounce of asking what then one s view had been to the small flash of this eruption fanny stood for her minute wittingly exposed but she saw it as quicklycease to threaten quite saw the princess even though in all herpain refuse in the interest of their strange and exaltedbargain to take advantage of the opportunity for planting thestab of reproach the opportunity thus coming all of itself shesaw her or she believed she saw her look at her chance forstraight denunciation look at it and then pass it by and shefelt herself with this fact hushed well nigh to awe at thelucid higher intention that no distress could confound and thatno discovery since it was however obscurely a case of discovery could make less needful these seconds were brief they rapidly passed but they lasted long enough to renew ourfriend s sense of her own extraordinary undertaking the functionagain imposed on her the answerability again drilled into her by this intensity of intimation she was reminded of the terms onwhich she was let off her quantity of release having made itssufficient show in that recall of her relation to charlotte s oldreappearance and deep within the whole impression glowed ah soinspiringly when it came to that her steady view clear from thefirst of the beauty of her companion s motive it was like afresh sacrifice for a larger conquest only see me through now do it in the face of this and in spite of it and i leave you ahand of which the freedom isn t to be said the aggravation offear or call it apparently of knowledge had jumped straightinto its place as an aggravation above all for her father theeffect of this being but to quicken to passion her reasons formaking his protectedness or in other words the forms of hisignorance still the law of her attitude and the key to hersolution she kept as tight hold of these reasons and theseforms in her confirmed horror as the rider of a plunging horsegrasps his seat with his knees and she might absolutely havebeen putting it to her guest that she believed she could stay onif they should only meet nothing more though ignorant still ofwhat she had definitely met fanny yearned within over herspirit and so no word about it said passed through merepitying eyes a vow to walk ahead and at crossroads with alantern for the darkness and wavings away for unadvised traffic look out for alarms there was accordingly no wait in maggie sreply they spent together hours spent at least a morning thecertainty of which has come back to me now but that i didn tdream of it at the time that cup there has turned witness bythe most wonderful of chances that s why since it has beenhere i ve stood it out for my husband to see put it where itwould meet him almost immediately if he should come into theroom i ve wanted it to meet him she went on and i ve wantedhim to meet it and to be myself present at the meeting but thathasn t taken place as yet often as he has lately been in the wayof coming to see me here yes in particular lately he hasn tshowed to day it was with her managed quietness more and more that she talked an achieved coherence that helped her evidently to hear and to watch herself there was support andthereby an awful harmony but which meant a further guidance inthe facts she could add together it s quite as if he had aninstinct something that has warned him off or made him uneasy he doesn t quite know naturally what has happened but guesses with his beautiful cleverness that something has and isn t in ahurry to be confronted with it so in his vague fear he keepsoff but being meanwhile in the house i ve no idea not having seen him to day by exception sincebefore luncheon he spoke to me then the princess freelyexplained of a ballot of great importance at a club forsomebody some personal friend i think who s coming up and issupposed to be in danger to make an effort for him he thought hehad better lunch there you see the efforts he can make forwhich maggie found a smile that went to her friend s heart he sin so many ways the kindest of men but it was hours ago mrs assingham thought the more danger then of his coming inand finding me here i don t know you see what you now considerthat you ve ascertained nor anything of the connexion with it ofthat object that you declare so damning her eyes rested on thisodd acquisition and then quitted it went back to it and againturned from it it was inscrutable in its rather stupid elegance and yet from the moment one had thus appraised it vivid anddefinite in its domination of the scene fanny could no moreoverlook it now than she could have overlooked a lightedchristmas tree but nervously and all in vain she dipped into hermind for some floating reminiscence of it at the same time thatthis attempt left her blank she understood a good deal she evennot a little shared the prince s mystic apprehension the goldenbowl put on under consideration a sturdy a consciousperversity as a document somehow it was ugly though itmight have a decorative grace his finding me here in presenceof it might be more flagrantly disagreeable for all of us thanyou intend or than would necessarily help us and i must taketime truly to understand what it means you re safe as far as that goes maggie returned you maytake it from me that he won t come in and that i shall only findhim below waiting for me when i go down to the carriage fanny assingham took it from her took it and more we re to sittogether at the ambassador s then or at least you two are withthis new complication thrust up before you all unexplained andto look at each other with faces that pretend for the ghastlyhour not to be seeing it maggie looked at her with a face that might have been the one shewas preparing unexplained my dear quite the contrary explained fully intensely admirably explained with nothingreally to add my own love she kept it up i don t wantanything more i ve plenty to go upon and to do with as it is fanny assingham stood there in her comparative darkness with herlinks verily still missing but the most acceptable effect ofthis was singularly as yet a cold fear of getting nearer thefact but when you come home i mean he ll come up with youagain won t he see it then on which maggie gave her after an instant s visible thought thestrangest of slow headshakes i don t know perhaps he ll neversee it if it only stands there waiting for him he may neveragain said the princess come into this room fanny more deeply wondered never again oh yes it may be how do i know with this she quietly went on she had not looked again at the incriminating piece but therewas a marvel to her friend in the way the little wordrepresenting it seemed to express and include for her the wholeof her situation then you intend not to speak to him maggie waited to speak well about your having it and about what you consider that itrepresents oh i don t know that i shall speak if he doesn t but hiskeeping away from me because of that what will that be but tospeak he can t say or do more it won t be for me to speak maggie added in a different tone one of the tones that hadalready so penetrated her guest it will be for me to listen mrs assingham turned it over then it all depends on thatobject that you regard for your reasons as evidence i think i may say that i depend on it i can t said maggie treat it as nothing now mrs assingham at this went closer to the cup on the chimney quite liking to feel that she did so moreover without goingcloser to her companion s vision she looked at the preciousthing if precious it was found herself in fact eyeing it as if by her dim solicitation to draw its secret from it rather thansuffer the imposition of maggie s knowledge it was brave andrich and firm with its bold deep hollow and without this queertorment about it would thanks to her love of plenty of yellow figure to her as an enviable ornament a possession reallydesirable she didn t touch it but if after a minute she turnedaway from it the reason was rather oddly and suddenly in herfear of doing so then it all depends on the bowl i mean yourfuture does for that s what it comes to i judge what it comes to maggie presently returned is what thatthing has put me so almost miraculously in the way of learning how far they had originally gone together if there was so muchbetween them before there can t with all the otherappearances not be a great deal more now and she went on andon she steadily made her points if such things were alreadythen between them they make all the difference for possible doubtof what may have been between them since if there had beennothing before there might be explanations but it makes to daytoo much to explain i mean to explain away she said fanny assingham was there to explain away of this she was dulyconscious for that at least had been true up to now in thelight however of maggie s demonstration the quantity evenwithout her taking as yet a more exact measure might well seemlarger than ever besides which with or without exactness theeffect of each successive minute in the place was to put her morein presence of what maggie herself saw maggie herself saw thetruth and that was really while they remained there together enough for mrs assingham s relation to it there was a force inthe princess s mere manner about it that made the detail of whatshe knew a matter of minor importance fanny had in factsomething like a momentary shame over her own need of asking forthis detail i don t pretend to repudiate she said after alittle my own impressions of the different times i suppose youspeak of any more she added than i can forget whatdifficulties and as it constantly seemed to me what dangers every course of action whatever i should decide upon made forme i tried i tried hard to act for the best and you know she next pursued while at the sound of her own statement aslow courage and even a faint warmth of conviction came back toher and you know i believe it s what i shall turn out to havedone this produced a minute during which their interchange thoughquickened and deepened was that of silence only and the long charged look all of which found virtual consecration when maggieat last spoke i m sure you tried to act for the best it kept fanny assingham again a minute in silence i neverthought dearest you weren t an angel not however that this alone was much help it was up to thevery eve you see the princess went on up to within two orthree days of our marriage that that you know and shebroke down for strangely smiling yes as i say it was while she was with me but i didn t knowit that is said fanny assingham i didn t know of anything inparticular it sounded weak that she felt but she had reallyher point to make what i mean is that i don t know forknowledge now anything i didn t then that s how i am shestill however floundered i mean it s how i was but don t they how you were and how you are maggie asked come practically to the same thing the elder woman s words hadstruck her own ear as in the tone now mistimed of their recent but all too factitious understanding arrived at in hours when as there was nothing susceptible of proof there was nothingdefinitely to disprove the situation had changed by well bywhatever there was by the outbreak of the definite and thiscould keep maggie at least firm she was firm enough as shepursued it was on the whole thing that amerigo married me with which her eyes had their turn again at her damnatory piece and it was on that it was on that but they came back to hervisitor and it was on it all that father married her her visitor took it as might be they both married ah that youmust believe with the highest intentions father did certainly and then at the renewal of thisconsciousness it all rolled over her ah to thrust such thingson us to do them here between us and with us day after day andin return in return to do it to him to him to him fanny hesitated you mean it s for him you most suffer andthen as the princess after a look but turned away moving aboutthe room which made the question somehow seem a blunder iask she continued because i think everything everything wenow speak of may be for him really may be made for him quiteas if it hadn t been but maggie had the next moment faced about as if without hearingher father did it for me did it all and only for me mrs assingham with a certain promptness threw up her head butshe faltered again before she spoke well it was only an intended word but maggie showed after an instantthat it had reached her do you mean that that s the reason that that s a reason fanny at first however feeling the response in this didn t sayall she meant she said for the moment something else instead he did it for you largely at least for you and it was for youthat i did in my smaller interested way well what i could do for i could do something she continued i thought i saw yourinterest as he himself saw it and i thought i saw charlotte s ibelieved in her and i believed in her said maggie mrs assingham waited again but she presently pushed on shebelieved then in herself ah maggie murmured something exquisite faintly eager in the prompt simplicity ofit supported her friend further and the prince believed hisbelief was real just as he believed in himself maggie spent a minute in taking it from her he believed inhimself just as i too believed in him for i absolutely did maggie to which fanny then added and i believe in him yet i mean she subjoined well i mean i do maggie again took it from her after which she was again restlessly set afloat then when this had come to an end anddo you believe in charlotte yet mrs assingham had a demur that she felt she could now afford we ll talk of charlotte some other day they both at any rate thought themselves safe at the time then why did they keep from me everything i might have known her friend bent upon her the mildest eyes why did i myself keepit from you oh you weren t for honour obliged dearest maggie the poor woman broke out on this you aredivine they pretended to love me the princess went on and theypretended to love him and pray what was there that i didn t pretend not at any rate to care for me as you cared for amerigo andfor charlotte they were much more interesting it was perfectlynatural how couldn t you like amerigo maggie continued mrs assingham gave it up how couldn t i how couldn t i then with a fine freedom she went all her way how can t i how can t i it fixed afresh maggie s wide eyes on her i see i see well it s beautiful for you to be able to and of course she added you wanted to help charlotte yes fanny considered it i wanted to help charlotte but iwanted also you see to help you by not digging up a past thati believed with so much on top of it solidly buried i wanted as i still want she richly declared to help every one it set maggie once more in movement movement which however spent itself again with a quick emphasis then it s a good dealmy fault if everything really began so well fanny assingham met it as she could you ve been only tooperfect you ve thought only too much but the princess had already caught at the words yes i vethought only too much yet she appeared to continue for theminute full of that fault she had it in fact by this promptedthought all before her of him dear man of him her friend able to take in thus directly her vision of herfather watched her with a new suspense that way might safetylie it was like a wider chink of light he believed with abeauty in charlotte yes and it was i who had made him believe i didn t mean to atthe time so much for i had no idea then of what was coming buti did it i did it the princess declared with a beauty ah with a beauty you too mrs assinghaminsisted maggie however was seeing for herself it was another matter the thing was that he made her think it would be so possible fanny again hesitated the prince made her think maggie stared she had meant her father but her vision seemed tospread they both made her think she wouldn t have thoughtwithout them yet amerigo s good faith mrs assingham insisted wasperfect and there was nothing all the more she added against your father s the remark however kept maggie for a moment still nothingperhaps but his knowing that she knew knew that he was doing it so much for me to what extent shesuddenly asked of her friend do you think he was aware that sheknew ah who can say what passes between people in such a relation the only thing one can be sure of is that he was generous andmrs assingham conclusively smiled he doubtless knew as much aswas right for himself as much that is as was right for her yes then as was right for her the point is fanny declared that whatever his knowledge it made all the way it went forhis good faith maggie continued to gaze and her friend now fairly waited on hersuccessive movements isn t the point very considerably thathis good faith must have been his faith in her taking almost asmuch interest in me as he himself took fanny assingham thought he recognised he adopted your longfriendship but he founded on it no selfishness no said maggie with still deeper consideration he countedher selfishness out almost as he counted his own so you may say very well maggie went on if he had none of his own heinvited her may have expected her on her side to have aslittle and she may only since have found that out mrs assingham looked blank since and he may have become aware maggie pursued that she hasfound it out that she has taken the measure since theirmarriage she explained of how much he had asked of her more say than she had understood at the time he may have made out atlast how such a demand was in the long run to affect her he may have done many things mrs assingham responded butthere s one thing he certainly won t have done he ll never haveshown that he expected of her a quarter as much as she must haveunderstood he was to give i ve often wondered maggie mused what charlotte reallyunderstood but it s one of the things she has never told me then as it s one of the things she has never told me either weshall probably never know it and we may regard it as none of ourbusiness there are many things said mrs assingham that weshall never know maggie took it in with a long reflection never but there are others her friend went on that stare us in theface and that under whatever difficulty you may feel youlabour may now be enough for us your father has beenextraordinary it had been as if maggie were feeling her way but she rallied tothis with a rush extraordinary magnificent said fanny assingham her companion held tight to it magnificent then he ll do for himself whatever there may be to do what heundertook for you he ll do to the end he didn t undertake it tobreak down in what quiet patient exquisite as he is did heever break down he had never in his life proposed to himself tohave failed and he won t have done it on this occasion ah this occasion and maggie s wail showed her of a sudden thrown back on it am i in the least sure that with everything he even knows what it is and yet am i in the least sure hedoesn t if he doesn t then so much the better leave him alone do you mean give him up leave her fanny assingham went on leave her to him maggie looked at her darkly do you mean leave him to her afterthis after everything aren t they for that matter intimatelytogether now intimately how do i know but fanny kept it up aren t you and your husband in spite ofeverything maggie s eyes still further if possible dilated it remains tobe seen if you re not then where s your faith in my husband mrs assingham but for an instant hesitated in your father itall comes back to that rest on it on his ignorance fanny met it again on whatever he may offer you take that take it maggie stared mrs assingham held up her head and be grateful on which fora minute she let the princess face her do you see i see said maggie at last then there you are but maggie had turned away moving to thewindow as if still to keep something in her face from sight shestood there with her eyes on the street while mrs assingham sreverted to that complicating object on the chimney as to whichher condition so oddly even to herself was that both ofrecurrent wonder and recurrent protest she went over it lookedat it afresh and yielded now to her impulse to feel it in herhands she laid them on it lifting it up and was surprised thus with the weight of it she had seldom handled so muchmassive gold that effect itself somehow prompted her to furtherfreedom and presently to saying i don t believe in this youknow it brought maggie round to her don t believe in it you willwhen i tell you ah tell me nothing i won t have it said mrs assingham shekept the cup in her hand held it there in a manner that gavemaggie s attention to her she saw the next moment a quality ofexcited suspense this suggested to her oddly that she had with the liberty she was taking an air of intention and theimpression betrayed by her companion s eyes grew more distinct ina word of warning it s of value but its value s impaired i velearned by a crack a crack in the gold it isn t gold with which somewhat strangely maggie smiled that s the point what is it then it s glass and cracked under the gilt as i say at that glass of this weight well said maggie it s crystal and was once i suppose precious but what she then asked do you mean to do with it she had come away from her window one of the three by which thewide room enjoying an advantageous back commanded the westernsky and caught a glimpse of the evening flush while mrs assingham possessed of the bowl and possessed too of thisindication of a flaw approached another for the benefit of theslowly fading light here thumbing the singular piece weighingit turning it over and growing suddenly more conscious aboveall of an irresistible impulse she presently spoke again acrack then your whole idea has a crack maggie by this time at some distance from her waited a moment if you mean by my idea the knowledge that has come to me that but fanny with decision had already taken her up there s onlyone knowledge that concerns us one fact with which we can haveanything to do which one then the fact that your husband has never never never but thevery gravity of this statement while she raised her eyes to herfriend across the room made her for an instant hang fire well never what never been half so interested in you as now but don t you mydear really feel it maggie considered oh i think what i ve told you helps me tofeel it his having to day given up even his forms his keepingaway from me his not having come and she shook her head asagainst all easy glosses it is because of that you know well then if it s because of this and fanny assingham whohad been casting about her and whose inspiration decidedly hadcome raised the cup in her two hands raised it positively aboveher head and from under it solemnly smiled at the princess asa signal of intention so for an instant full of her thought andof her act she held the precious vessel and then with due notetaken of the margin of the polished floor bare fine and hard inthe embrasure of her window she dashed it boldly to the ground where she had the thrill of seeing it with the violence of thecrash lie shattered she had flushed with the force of hereffort as maggie had flushed with wonder at the sight and thishigh reflection in their faces was all that passed between themfor a minute more after which whatever you meant by it and idon t want to know now has ceased to exist mrs assinghamsaid and what in the world my dear did you mean by it thatsound as at the touch of a spring rang out as the first effectof fanny s speech it broke upon the two women s absorption witha sharpness almost equal to the smash of the crystal for thedoor of the room had been opened by the prince without theirtaking heed he had apparently had time moreover to catch theconclusion of fanny s act his eyes attached themselves throughthe large space allowing just there as happened a free view tothe shining fragments at this lady s feet his question had beenaddressed to his wife but he moved his eyes immediatelyafterwards to those of her visitor whose own then held them in amanner of which neither party had been capable doubtless formute penetration since the hour spent by him in cadogan place onthe eve of his marriage and the afternoon of charlotte sreappearance something now again became possible for thesecommunicants under the intensity of their pressure somethingthat took up that tale and that might have been a redemption ofpledges then exchanged this rapid play of suppressed appeal anddisguised response lasted indeed long enough for more resultsthan one long enough for mrs assingham to measure the feat ofquick self recovery possibly therefore of recognition still moreimmediate accompanying amerigo s vision and estimate of theevidence with which she had been so admirably she felt as shelooked at him inspired to deal she looked at him and looked athim there were so many things she wanted on the spot to say but maggie was looking too and was moreover looking at themboth so that these things for the elder woman quickly enoughreduced themselves to one she met his question not too late since in their silence it had remained in the air gatheringherself to go leaving the golden bowl split into three pieces onthe ground she simply referred him to his wife she should seethem later they would all meet soon again and meanwhile as towhat maggie had meant she said in her turn from the door why maggie herself was doubtless by this time ready to tell him xxxivleft with her husband maggie however for the time saidnothing she only felt on the spot a strong sharp wish not tosee his face again till he should have had a minute to arrangeit she had seen it enough for her temporary clearness and hernext movement seen it as it showed during the stare of surprisethat followed his entrance then it was that she knew how hugelyexpert she had been made for judging it quickly by that visionof it indelibly registered for reference that had flashed alight into her troubled soul the night of his late return frommatcham the expression worn by it at that juncture for howeverfew instants had given her a sense of its possibilities one ofthe most relevant of which might have been playing up for her before the consummation of fanny assingham s retreat just longenough to be recognised what she had recognised in it was hisrecognition the result of his having been forced by the flushof their visitor s attitude and the unextinguished report of herwords to take account of the flagrant signs of the accident ofthe incident on which he had unexpectedly dropped he had notunnaturally failed to see this occurrence represented by thethree fragments of an object apparently valuable which lay thereon the floor and which even across the width of the room hiskept interval reminded him unmistakably though confusedly ofsomething known some other unforgotten image that was a mereshock that was a pain as if fanny s violence had been aviolence redoubled and acting beyond its intention a violencecalling up the hot blood as a blow across the mouth might havecalled it maggie knew as she turned away from him that shedidn t want his pain what she wanted was her own simplecertainty not the red mark of conviction flaming there in hisbeauty if she could have gone on with bandaged eyes she wouldhave liked that best if it were a question of saying what shenow apparently should have to and of taking from him what hewould say any blindness that might wrap it would be the nearestapproach to a boon she went in silence to where her friend never in intention visibly so much her friend as at that moment had braced herselfto so amazing an energy and there under amerigo s eyes shepicked up the shining pieces bedizened and jewelled in herrustling finery she paid with humility of attitude this prompttribute to order only to find however that she could carry buttwo of the fragments at once she brought them over to thechimney piece to the conspicuous place occupied by the cupbefore fanny s appropriation of it and after laying themcarefully down went back for what remained the solid detachedfoot with this she returned to the mantel shelf placing it withdeliberation in the centre and then for a minute occupyingherself as with the attempt to fit the other morsels after shehad squared again her little objects on the chimney she waswithin an ace in fact of turning on him with that appeal besides its being lucid for her all the while that the occasionwas passing that they were dining out that he wasn t dressed and that though she herself was she was yet in allprobability so horribly red in the face and so awry in manyways with agitation that in view of the ambassador s company of possible comments and constructions she should need beforeher glass some restoration of appearances amerigo meanwhile after all could clearly make the most of herhaving enjoined on him to wait suggested it by the positive pompof her dealings with the smashed cup to wait that is till sheshould pronounce as mrs assingham had promised for her thisdelay again certainly tested her presence of mind though thatstrain was not what presently made her speak keep her eyes forthe time from her husband s as she might she soon found herselfmuch more drivingly conscious of the strain on his own wit therewas even a minute when her back was turned to him during whichshe knew once more the strangeness of her desire to spare him astrangeness that had already fifty times brushed her in thedepth of her trouble as with the wild wing of some bird of theair who might blindly have swooped for an instant into the shaftof a well darkening there by his momentary flutter the far offround of sky it was extraordinary this quality in the taste ofher wrong which made her completed sense of it seem rather tosoften than to harden and it was the more extraordinary the moreshe had to recognise it for what it came to was that seeingherself finally sure knowing everything having the fact in allits abomination so utterly before her that there was nothingelse to add what it came to was that merely by being with himthere in silence she felt within her the sudden split betweenconviction and action they had begun to cease on the spot surprisingly to be connected conviction that is budged noinch only planting its feet the more firmly in the soil butaction began to hover like some lighter and larger but easierform excited by its very power to keep above ground it would befree it would be independent it would go in wouldn t it forsome prodigious and superior adventure of its own what wouldcondemn it so to speak to the responsibility of freedom thisglimmered on maggie even now was the possibility richer withevery lapsing moment that her husband would have on the wholequestion a new need of her a need which was in fact being bornbetween them in these very seconds it struck her truly as so newthat he would have felt hitherto none to compare with it at all would indeed absolutely by this circumstance be really needingher for the first one in their whole connection no he had usedher had even exceedingly enjoyed her before this but there hadbeen no precedent for that character of a proved necessity to himwhich she was rapidly taking on the immense advantage of thisparticular clue moreover was that she should have now toarrange alter to falsify nothing should have to be butconsistently simple and straight she asked herself withconcentration while her back was still presented what would bethe very ideal of that method after which the next instant ithad all come to her and she had turned round upon him for theapplication fanny assingham broke it knowing it had a crackand that it would go if she used sufficient force she thought when i had told her that that would be the best thing to do withit thought so from her own point of view that hadn t been atall my idea but she acted before i understood i had on thecontrary she explained put it here in full view exactlythat you might see he stood with his hands in his pockets he had carried his eyesto the fragments on the chimney piece and she could alreadydistinguish the element of relief absolutely of succour in hisacceptance from her of the opportunity to consider the fruits oftheir friend s violence every added inch of reflection and delayhaving the advantage from this point on of counting for himdouble it had operated within her now to the last intensity herglimpse of the precious truth that by her helping him helpinghim to help himself as it were she should help him to help her hadn t she fairly got into his labyrinth with him wasn t sheindeed in the very act of placing herself there for him at itscentre and core whence on that definite orientation and by aninstinct all her own she might securely guide him out of it sheoffered him thus assuredly a kind of support that was not tohave been imagined in advance and that moreover required ahmost truly some close looking at before it could be believed inand pronounced void of treachery yes look look she seemedto see him hear her say even while her sounded words were other look look both at the truth that still survives in thatsmashed evidence and at the even more remarkable appearance thati m not such a fool as you supposed me look at the possibilitythat since i am different there may still be something in itfor you if you re capable of working with me to get that out consider of course as you must the question of what you mayhave to surrender on your side what price you may have to pay whom you may have to pay with to set this advantage free buttake in at any rate that there is something for you if youdon t too blindly spoil your chance for it he went no nearerthe damnatory pieces but he eyed them from where he stood witha degree of recognition just visibly less to be dissimulated allof which represented for her a certain traceable process and heruttered words meanwhile were different enough from those hemight have inserted between the lines of her already spoken it s the golden bowl you know that you saw at the littleantiquario s in bloomsbury so long ago when you went there withcharlotte when you spent those hours with her unknown to me aday or two before our marriage it was shown you both but youdidn t take it you left it for me and i came upon it extraordinarily through happening to go into the same shop onmonday last in walking home in prowling about to pick up somesmall old thing for father s birthday after my visit to themuseum my appointment there with mr crichton of which i toldyou it was shown me and i was struck with it and took it knowing nothing about it at the time what i now know i velearned since i learned this afternoon a couple of hours ago receiving from it naturally a great impression so there it is in its three pieces you can handle them don t be afraid if youwant to make sure the thing is the thing you and charlotte sawtogether its having come apart makes an unfortunate differencefor its beauty its artistic value but none for anything else its other value is just the same i mean that of its having givenme so much of the truth about you i don t therefore so much carewhat becomes of it now unless perhaps you may yourself when youcome to think have some good use for it in that case maggiewound up we can easily take the pieces with us to fawns it was wonderful how she felt by the time she had seen herselfthrough this narrow pass that she had really achievedsomething that she was emerging a little in fine with theprospect less contracted she had done for him that is what herinstinct enjoined had laid a basis not merely momentary on whichhe could meet her when by the turn of his head he did finallymeet her this was the last thing that glimmered out of his look but it came into sight none the less as a perception of hisdistress and almost as a question of his eyes so that for stillanother minute before he committed himself there occurredbetween them a kind of unprecedented moral exchange over whichher superior lucidity presided it was not however that when hedid commit himself the show was promptly portentous but what inthe world has fanny assingham had to do with it she could verily out of all her smothered soreness almost havesmiled his question so affected her as giving the whole thing upto her but it left her only to go the straighter she has hadto do with it that i immediately sent for her and that sheimmediately came she was the first person i wanted to see because i knew she would know know more about what i hadlearned i mean than i could make out for myself i made out asmuch as i could for myself that i also wanted to have done butit didn t in spite of everything take me very far and she hasreally been a help not so much as she would like to be not somuch as poor dear she just now tried to be yet she has doneher very best for you never forget that and has kept me alongimmeasurably better than i should have been able to come withouther she has gained me time and that these three months don tyou see has been everything she had said don t you see on purpose and was to feel thenext moment that it had acted these three months the princeasked counting from the night you came home so late from matcham counting from the hours you spent with charlotte at gloucester your visit to the cathedral which you won t have forgottendescribing to me in so much detail for that was the beginning ofmy being sure before it i had been sufficiently in doubt sure maggie developed of your having and of your having for a longtime had two relations with charlotte he stared a little at sea as he took it up two something in the tone of it gave it a sense or an ambiguity almost foolish leaving maggie to feel as in a flash how such aconsequence a foredoomed infelicity partaking of the ridiculouseven in one of the cleverest might be of the very essence of thepenalty of wrong doing oh you may have had fifty had the samerelation with her fifty times it s of the number of kinds ofrelation with her that i speak a number that doesn t matter really so long as there wasn t only one kind as father and isupposed one kind she went on was there before us we tookthat fully for granted as you saw and accepted it we neverthought of there being another kept out of our sight but afterthe evening i speak of i knew there was something else as i say i had before that my idea which you never dreamed i had fromthe moment i speak of it had more to go upon and you becameyourselves you and she vaguely yet uneasily conscious of thedifference but it s within these last hours that i ve most seenwhere we are and as i ve been in communication with fannyassingham about my doubts so i wanted to let her know mycertainty with the determination of which however you mustunderstand she has had nothing to do she defends you maggieremarked he had given her all his attention and with this impression forher again that he was in essence fairly reaching out to herfor time time only time she could sufficiently imagine and towhatever strangeness that he absolutely liked her to talk evenat the cost of his losing almost everything else by it it wasstill for a minute as if he waited for something worse wantedeverything that was in her to come out any definite fact anything more precisely nameable so that he too as was hisright should know where he was what stirred in him above all while he followed in her face the clear train of her speech musthave been the impulse to take up something she put before himthat he was yet afraid directly to touch he wanted to make freewith it but had to keep his hands off for reasons he hadalready made out and the discomfort of his privation yearned ather out of his eyes with an announcing gleam of the fever thenone too tolerable chill of specific recognition she affectedhim as speaking more or less for her father as well and his eyesmight have been trying to hypnotise her into giving him theanswer without his asking the question had he his idea and hashe now with you anything more those were the words he had tohold himself from not speaking and that she would as yet certainly do nothing to make easy she felt with her sharpestthrill how he was straitened and tied and with the miserablepity of it her present conscious purpose of keeping him so couldnone the less perfectly accord to name her father on any suchbasis of anxiety of compunction would be to do the impossiblething to do neither more nor less than give charlotte away visibly palpably traceably he stood off from this movedback from it as from an open chasm now suddenly perceived butwhich had been between the two with so much so strangely muchelse quite uncalculated verily it towered before her thishistory of their confidence they had built strong and piledhigh based as it was on such appearances their conviction that thanks to her native complacencies of so many sorts she wouldalways quite to the end and through and through take them asnobly sparing her amerigo was at any rate having the sensationof a particular ugliness to avoid a particular difficulty tocount with that practically found him as unprepared as if he hadbeen like his wife an abjectly simple person and shemeanwhile however abjectly simple was further discerning forherself that whatever he might have to take from her shebeing on her side beautifully free he would absolutely not beable for any qualifying purpose to name charlotte either ashis father in law s wife mrs verver rose between them there forthe time in august and prohibitive form to protect her defendher explain about her was at the least to bring her into thequestion which would be by the same stroke to bring her husband but this was exactly the door maggie wouldn t open to him on allof which she was the next moment asking herself if thus warnedand embarrassed he were not fairly writhing in his pain hewrithed on that hypothesis some seconds more for it was nottill then that he had chosen between what he could do and what hecouldn t you re apparently drawing immense conclusions from very smallmatters won t you perhaps feel in fairness that you restriking out triumphing or whatever i may call it rather tooeasily feel it when i perfectly admit that your smashed cupthere does come back to me i frankly confess now to theoccasion and to having wished not to speak of it to you at thetime we took two or three hours together by arrangement it wason the eve of my marriage at the moment you say but that put iton the eve of yours too my dear which was directly the point it was desired to find for you at the eleventh hour some smallwedding present a hunt for something worth giving you and yetpossible from other points of view as well in which it seemed icould be of use you were naturally not to be told preciselybecause it was all for you we went forth together and we looked we rummaged about and as i remember we called it we prowled then it was that as i freely recognise we came across thatcrystal cup which i m bound to say upon my honour i think itrather a pity fanny assingham from whatever good motive shouldhave treated so he had kept his hands in his pockets he turnedhis eyes again but more complacently now to the ruins of theprecious vessel and maggie could feel him exhale into theachieved quietness of his explanation a long deep breath ofcomparative relief behind everything beneath everything it wassomehow a comfort to him at last to be talking with her and heseemed to be proving to himself that he could talk it was at alittle shop in bloomsbury i think i could go to the place now the man understood italian i remember he wanted awfully to workoff his bowl but i didn t believe in it and we didn t take it maggie had listened with an interest that wore all the expressionof candour oh you left it for me but what did you take he looked at her first as if he were trying to remember then asif he might have been trying to forget nothing i think atthat place what did you take then at any other what did you get me sincethat was your aim and end for a wedding gift the prince continued very nobly to bethink himself didn t weget you anything maggie waited a little she had for some time now kept her eyeson him steadily but they wandered at this to the fragments onher chimney yes it comes round after all to your having gotme the bowl i myself was to come upon it the other day by sowonderful a chance was to find it in the same place and to haveit pressed upon me by the same little man who does as you say understand italian i did believe in it you see must havebelieved in it somehow instinctively for i took it as soon as isaw it though i didn t know at all then she added what i wastaking with it the prince paid her for an instant visibly the deference oftrying to imagine what this might have been i agree with youthat the coincidence is extraordinary the sort of thing thathappens mainly in novels and plays but i don t see you must letme say the importance or the connexion of my having made the purchase where you failed of it she hadquickly taken him up but she had with her eyes on him oncemore another drop into the order of her thoughts to which through whatever he might say she was still adhering it s notmy having gone into the place at the end of four years thatmakes the strangeness of the coincidence for don t such chancesas that in london easily occur the strangeness she lucidlysaid is in what my purchase was to represent to me after i hadgot it home which value came she explained from the wonderof my having found such a friend such a friend as a wonder assuredly her husband could buttake it as the little man in the shop he did for me more than he knew i owe it to him he took an interest in me maggie said and taking that interest he recalled your visit he remembered youand spoke of you to me on which the prince passed the comment of a sceptical smile ahbut my dear if extraordinary things come from people s takingan interest in you my life in that case she asked must be very agitated well he liked me i mean very particularly it s only so i canaccount for my afterwards hearing from him and in fact he gaveme that to day she pursued he gave me it frankly as hisreason to day the prince inquiringly echoed but she was singularly able it had been marvellously given her she afterwards said to herself to abide for her light forher clue by her own order i inspired him with sympathy there you are but the miracle isthat he should have a sympathy to offer that could be of use tome that was really the oddity of my chance the princessproceeded that i should have been moved in my ignorance to goprecisely to him he saw her so keep her course that it was as if he could at thebest but stand aside to watch her and let her pass he only madea vague demonstration that was like an ineffective gesture i msorry to say any ill of your friends and the thing was a longtime ago besides which there was nothing to make me recur to it but i remember the man s striking me as a decided little beast she gave a slow headshake as if no after consideration notthat way were an issue i can only think of him as kind for hehad nothing to gain he had in fact only to lose it was what hecame to tell me that he had asked me too high a price more thanthe object was really worth there was a particular reason whichhe hadn t mentioned and which had made him consider and repent he wrote for leave to see me again wrote in such terms that isaw him here this afternoon here it made the prince look about him downstairs in the little red room while he was waiting helooked at the few photographs that stand about there andrecognised two of them though it was so long ago he rememberedthe visit made him by the lady and the gentleman and that gavehim his connexion it gave me mine for he remembered everythingand told me everything you see you too had produced your effect only unlike you he had thought of it again he had recurred toit he told me of your having wished to make each otherpresents but of that s not having come off the lady was greatlytaken with the piece i had bought of him but you had your reasonagainst receiving it from her and you had been right he wouldthink that of you more than ever now maggie went on he wouldsee how wisely you had guessed the flaw and how easily the bowlcould be broken i had bought it myself you see for apresent he knew i was doing that this was what had worked inhim especially after the price i had paid her story had dropped an instant she still brought it out insmall waves of energy each of which spent its force so that hehad an opportunity to speak before this force was renewed butthe quaint thing was what he now said and what pray was theprice she paused again a little it was high certainly for thosefragments i think i feel as i look at them there ratherashamed to say the prince then again looked at them he might have been growingused to the sight but shall you at least get your money back oh i m far from wanting it back i feel so that i m getting itsworth with which before he could reply she had a quicktransition the great fact about the day we re talking of seemsto me to have been quite remarkably that no present was thenmade me if your undertaking had been for that that was not atleast what came of it you received then nothing at all the prince looked vague andgrave almost retrospectively concerned nothing but an apology for empty hands and empty pockets whichwas made me as if it mattered a mite ever so frankly ever sobeautifully and touchingly this amerigo heard with interest yet not with confusion ah ofcourse you couldn t have minded distinctly as she went on hewas getting the better of the mere awkwardness of his arrest quite as if making out that he need suffer arrest from her now before they should go forth to show themselves in the worldtogether in no greater quantity than an occasion ill chosen atthe best for a scene might decently make room for he looked athis watch their engagement all the while remained before him but i don t make out you see what case against me yourest on everything i m telling you why the whole case the case ofyour having for so long so successfully deceived me the idea ofyour finding something for me charming as that would have been was what had least to do with your taking a morning together atthat moment what had really to do with it said maggie wasthat you had to you couldn t not from the moment you were againface to face and the reason of that was that there had been somuch between you before before i came between you at all her husband had been for these last moments moving about underher eyes but at this as to check any show of impatience heagain stood still you ve never been more sacred to me than youwere at that hour unless perhaps you ve become so at this one the assurance of his speech she could note quite held up itshead in him his eyes met her own so for the declaration thatit was as if something cold and momentarily unimaginable breathedupon her from afar off out of his strange consistency she kepther direction still however under that oh the thing i veknown best of all is that you ve never wanted together tooffend us you ve wanted quite intensely not to and theprecautions you ve had to take for it have been for a long timeone of the strongest of my impressions that i think sheadded is the way i ve best known known he repeated after a moment known known that you were older friends and so much moreintimate ones than i had any reason to suppose when we married known there were things that hadn t been told me and that gavetheir meaning little by little to other things that were beforeme would they have made a difference in the matter of ourmarriage the prince presently asked if you had known them she took her time to think i grant you not in the matter ofours and then as he again fixed her with his hard yearning which he couldn t keep down the question is so much bigger thanthat you see how much what i know makes of it for me that waswhat acted on him this iteration of her knowledge into thequestion of the validity of the various bearings of which hecouldn t on the spot trust himself to pretend in any high way to go what her claim as she made it represented for him thathe couldn t help betraying if only as a consequence of theeffect of the word itself her repeated distinct know know onhis nerves she was capable of being sorry for his nerves at atime when he should need them for dining out pompously ratherresponsibly without his heart in it yet she was not to let thatprevent her using with all economy so precious a chance forsupreme clearness i didn t force this upon you you mustrecollect and it probably wouldn t have happened for you if youhadn t come in ah said the prince i was liable to come in you know i didn t think you were this evening and why not well she answered you have many liabilities of differentsorts with which she recalled what she had said to fannyassingham and then you re so deep it produced in his features in spite of his control of them oneof those quick plays of expression the shade of a grimace thattestified as nothing else did to his race it s you cara whoare deep which after an instant she had accepted from him she could sofeel at last that it was true then i shall have need of itall but what would you have done he was by this time asking if ihadn t come in i don t know she had hesitated what would you oh io that isn t the question i depend upon you i go on youwould have spoken to morrow i think i would have waited and for what he asked to see what difference it would make for myself my possessionat last i mean of real knowledge oh said the prince my only point now at any rate she went on is thedifference as i say that it may make for you your knowingwas from the moment you did come in all i had in view and shesounded it again he should have it once more your knowing thati ve ceased that you ve ceased with her pause in fact she had fairlymade him press her for it why to be as i was not to know it was once more then after a little that he had had to standreceptive yet the singular effect of this was that there wasstill something of the same sort he was made to want he hadanother hesitation but at last this odd quantity showed thendoes any one else know it was as near as he could come to naming her father and shekept him at that distance any one any one i mean but fanny assingham i should have supposed you had had by this time particular meansof learning i don t see she said why you ask me then after an instant and only after an instant as she saw hemade out what she meant and it gave her all strangely enough the still further light that charlotte for herself knew aslittle as he had known the vision loomed in this light itfairly glared for the few seconds the vision of the two othersalone together at fawns and charlotte as one of them havinggropingly to go on always not knowing and not knowing thepicture flushed at the same time with all its essential colour that of the so possible identity of her father s motive andprinciple with her own he was deep as amerigo called it sothat no vibration of the still air should reach his daughter just as she had earned that description by making and by forthat matter intending still to make her care for his serenity or at any rate for the firm outer shell of his dignity allmarvellous enamel her paramount law more strangely even thananything else her husband seemed to speak now but to help her inthis i know nothing but what you tell me then i ve told you all i intended find out the rest find it out he waited she stood before him a moment it took that time to go on depthupon depth of her situation as she met his face surged and sankwithin her but with the effect somehow once more that theyrather lifted her than let her drop she had her feet somewhere through it all it was her companion absolutely who was at sea and she kept her feet she pressed them to what was beneath her she went over to the bell beside the chimney and gave a ring thathe could but take as a summons for her maid it stoppedeverything for the present it was an intimation to him to go anddress but she had to insist find out for yourself part fifthxxxvafter the little party was again constituted at fawns which hadtaken for completeness some ten days maggie naturally feltherself still more possessed in spirit of everything that hadlast happened in london there was a phrase that came back to herfrom old american years she was having by that idiom the timeof her life she knew it by the perpetual throb of this sense ofpossession which was almost too violent either to recognise orto hide it was as if she had come out that was her most generalconsciousness out of a dark tunnel a dense wood or even simplya smoky room and had thereby at least for going on theadvantage of air in her lungs it was as if she were somehow atlast gathering in the fruits of patience she had either beenreally more patient than she had known at the time or had beenso for longer the change brought about by itself as great adifference of view as the shift of an inch in the position of atelescope it was her telescope in fact that had gained inrange just as her danger lay in her exposing herself to theobservation by the more charmed and therefore the more reckless use of this optical resource not under any provocation toproduce it in public was her unremitted rule but thedifficulties of duplicity had not shrunk while the need of ithad doubled humbugging which she had so practised with herfather had been a comparatively simple matter on the basis ofmere doubt but the ground to be covered was now greatly larger and she felt not unlike some young woman of the theatre who engaged for a minor part in the play and having mastered her cueswith anxious effort should find herself suddenly promoted toleading lady and expected to appear in every act of the five shehad made much to her husband that last night of her knowing but it was exactly this quantity she now knew that from themoment she could only dissimulate it added to her responsibilityand made of the latter all a mere question of havingsomething precious and precarious in charge there was no one tohelp her with it not even fanny assingham now this goodfriend s presence having become inevitably with that climax oftheir last interview in portland place a severely simplifiedfunction she had her use oh yes a thousand times but it couldonly consist henceforth in her quite conspicuously touching at nopoint whatever assuredly at least with maggie the matter theyhad discussed she was there inordinately as a value but as avalue only for the clear negation of everything she was theirgeneral sign precisely of unimpaired beatitude and she was tolive up to that somewhat arduous character poor thing as shemight she might privately lapse from it if she must withamerigo or with charlotte only not of course ever so much asfor the wink of an eye with the master of the house such lapseswould be her own affair which maggie at present could take nothought of she treated her young friend meanwhile it was to besaid to no betrayal of such wavering so that from the moment ofher alighting at the door with the colonel everything went onbetween them at concert pitch what had she done that lastevening in maggie s room but bring the husband and wife moretogether than as would seem they had ever been therefore whatindiscretion should she not show by attempting to go behind thegrand appearance of her success which would be to court a doubtof her beneficent work she knew accordingly nothing but harmonyand diffused restlessly nothing but peace an extravagant expressive aggressive peace not incongruous after all withthe solid calm of the place a kind of helmetted trident shakingpax britannica the peace it must be added had become as the days elapsed apeace quite generally animated and peopled thanks to that factof the presence of company in which maggie s ability topreserve an appearance had learned from so far back to find itsbest resource it was not inconspicuous it was in fact striking that this resource just now seemed to meet in the highestdegree every one s need quite as if every one were by themultiplication of human objects in the scene by the creation bythe confusion of fictive issues hopeful of escaping somebodyelse s notice it had reached the point in truth that thecollective bosom might have been taken to heave with theknowledge of the descent upon adjacent shores for a shortperiod of mrs rance and the lutches still united and still sodivided for conquest the sense of the party showed at least oddly enough as favourable to the fancy of the quaint turn thatsome near week end might derive from their reappearance thismeasured for maggie the ground they had all travelled togethersince that unforgotten afternoon of the none so distant year that determinant september sunday when sitting with her fatherin the park as in commemoration of the climax both of their oldorder and of their old danger she had proposed to him that theyshould call in charlotte call her in as a specialist might besummoned to an invalid s chair wasn t it a sign of somethingrather portentous their being ready to be beholden as for adiversion to the once despised kitty and dotty that had alreadyhad its application in truth to her invocation of thecastledeans and several other members again of the historicmatcham week made before she left town and made alwaysconsistently with an idea since she was never henceforth toapproach these people without an idea and since that luridelement of their intercourse grew and grew for her with eachoccasion the flame with which it burned afresh during theseparticular days the way it held up the torch to anything toeverything that might have occurred as the climax of revelsspringing from traditions so vivified this by itself justifiedher private motive and reconsecrated her diplomacy she hadalready produced by the aid of these people something of theeffect she sought that of being good for whatever hercompanions were good for and of not asking either of them togive up anyone or anything for her sake there was moreover frankly a sharpness of point in it that she enjoyed it gave anaccent to the truth she wished to illustrate the truth that thesurface of her recent life thick sown with the flower of earnestendeavour with every form of the unruffled and the undoubting suffered no symptom anywhere to peep out it was as if under herpressure neither party could get rid of the complicity as itmight be figured of the other as if in a word she saw amerigoand charlotte committed for fear of betrayals on their own side to a kind of wan consistency on the subject of lady castledean s set and this latter group by the same stroke compelled toassist at attestations the extent and bearing of which theyrather failed to grasp and which left them indeed in spite ofhereditary high spirits a trifle bewildered and even a triflescared they made none the less at fawns for number for movement forsound they played their parts during a crisis that must havehovered for them in the long passages of the old house afterthe fashion of the established ghost felt through the darkhours as a constant possibility rather than have menaced them inthe form of a daylight bore one of the perceived outsiders whoare liable to be met in the drawing room or to be sat next to atdinner if the princess moreover had failed of her occult usefor so much of the machinery of diversion she would still havehad a sense not other than sympathetic for the advantage nowextracted from it by fanny assingham s bruised philosophy thisgood friend s relation to it was actually the revanche shesufficiently indicated of her obscured lustre at matcham whereshe had known her way about so much less than most of the others she knew it at fawns through the pathless wild of the righttone positively better than any one maggie could note for her and her revenge had the magnanimity of a brave pointing out of itto every one else a wonderful irresistible conscious almostcompassionate patronage here was a house she triumphantlycaused it to be noted in which she so bristled with values thatsome of them might serve by her amused willingness to share forsuch of the temporarily vague among her fellow guests such ofthe dimly disconcerted as had lost the key to their own it mayhave been partly through the effect of this especial strain ofcommunity with her old friend that maggie found herself oneevening moved to take up again their dropped directness ofreference they had remained downstairs together late the otherwomen of the party had filed singly or in couples up the grand staircase on which from the equally grand hall theseretreats and advances could always be pleasantly observed themen had apparently taken their way to the smoking room while theprincess in possession thus of a rare reach of view hadlingered as if to enjoy it then she saw that mrs assingham wasremaining a little and as for the appreciation of her enjoyment upon which they stood looking at each other across the clearedprospect until the elder woman only vaguely expressive andtentative now came nearer it was like the act of asking ifthere were anything she could yet do and that question wasanswered by her immediately feeling on this closer view as shehad felt when presenting herself in portland place after maggie slast sharp summons their understanding was taken up by these newsnatched moments where that occasion had left it he has never told her that i know of that i m at lastsatisfied and then as mrs assingham opened wide eyes i vebeen in the dark since we came down not understanding what hehas been doing or intending not making out what can have passedbetween them but within a day or two i ve begun to suspect andthis evening for reasons oh too many to tell you i ve beensure since it explains nothing has passed between them that swhat has happened it explains the princess repeated withenergy it explains it explains she spoke in a manner thather auditor was afterwards to describe to the colonel oddlyenough as that of the quietest excitement she had turned backto the chimney place where in honour of a damp day and a chillnight the piled logs had turned to flame and sunk to embers andthe evident intensity of her vision for the fact she impartedmade fanny assingham wait upon her words it explained thisstriking fact more indeed than her companion though consciousof fairly gaping with good will could swallow at once theprincess however as for indulgence and confidence quicklyfilled up the measure he hasn t let her know that i know and clearly doesn t mean to he has made up his mind he ll saynothing about it therefore as she s quite unable to arrive atthe knowledge by herself she has no idea how much i m really inpossession she believes said maggie and so far as her ownconviction goes she knows that i m not in possession ofanything and that somehow for my own help seems to meimmense immense my dear mrs assingham applausively murmured thoughnot quite even as yet seeing all the way he s keeping quietthen on purpose on purpose maggie s lighted eyes at least looked furtherthan they had ever looked he ll never tell her now fanny wondered she cast about her most of all she admired herlittle friend in whom this announcement was evidently animatedby an heroic lucidity she stood there in her full uniform likesome small erect commander of a siege an anxious captain who hassuddenly got news replete with importance for him of agitation of division within the place this importance breathed upon hercomrade so you re all right oh all right s a good deal to say but i seem at least to see as i haven t before where i am with it fanny bountifully brooded there was a point left vague and youhave it from him your husband himself has told you told me why what you speak of it isn t of an assurance received fromhim then that you do speak at which maggie had continued to stare dear me no do yousuppose i ve asked him for an assurance ah you haven t her companion smiled that s what i supposedyou might mean then darling what have you asked him for i ve asked him for nothing but this in turn made fanny stare then nothing that eveningof the embassy dinner passed between you on the contrary everything passed everything everything i told him what i knew and i told him how i knewit mrs assingham waited and that was all wasn t it quite enough oh love she bridled that s for you to have judged then i have judged said maggie i did judge i made sure heunderstood then i let him alone mrs assingham wondered but he didn t explain explain thank god no maggie threw back her head as with horror at the thought then the next moment added and i didn t either the decency of pride in it shed a cold little light yet as fromheights at the base of which her companion rather panted but ifhe neither denies nor confesses he does what s a thousand times better he lets it alone hedoes maggie went on as he would do as i see now that i wassure he would he lets me alone fanny assingham turned it over then how do you know so where as you say you are why just by that i put him in possession of the difference the difference made about me by the fact that i hadn t been after all though with a wonderful chance i admitted helpingme too stupid to have arrived at knowledge he had to see thati m changed for him quite changed from the idea of me that hehad so long been going on with it became a question then of hisreally taking in the change and what i now see is that he isdoing so fanny followed as she could which he shows by letting you asyou say alone maggie looked at her a minute and by letting her mrs assingham did what she might to embrace it checked alittle however by a thought that was the nearest approach shecould have in this almost too large air to an inspiration ah but does charlotte let him oh that s another affair with which i ve practically nothingto do i dare say however she doesn t and the princess had amore distant gaze for the image evoked by the question i don tin fact well see how she can but the point for me is that heunderstands yes fanny assingham cooed understands well what i want i want a happiness without a hole in it bigenough for you to poke in your finger a brilliant perfect surface to begin with at least i see the golden bowl as it was to have been and maggie dweltmusingly on this obscured figure the bowl with all ourhappiness in it the bowl without the crack for mrs assingham too the image had its force and the preciousobject shone before her again reconstituted plausible presentable but wasn t there still a piece missing yet if helets you alone and you only let him mayn t our doing so you mean be noticed mayn t it give usaway well we hope not we try not we take such care we aloneknow what s between us we and you and haven t you preciselybeen struck since you ve been here maggie asked with ourmaking so good a show her friend hesitated to your father but it made her hesitate too she wouldn t speak of her fatherdirectly to everyone to her now that you understand it held poor fanny again in wonder to charlotte yes ifthere s so much beneath it for you and if it s all such a plan that makes it hang together it makes you hang together shefairly exhaled her admiration you re like nobody else you reextraordinary maggie met it with appreciation but with a reserve no i m notextraordinary but i am for every one quiet well that s just what is extraordinary quiet is more than i am and you leave me far behind with which again for aninstant mrs assingham frankly brooded now that iunderstand you say but there s one thing i don t understand and the next minute while her companion waited she hadmentioned it how can charlotte after all not have pressedhim not have attacked him about it how can she not have askedhim asked him on his honour i mean if you know how can she not why of course said the princess limpidly she must well then well then you think he must have told her why exactly what imean said maggie is that he will have done nothing of thesort will as i say have maintained the contrary fanny assingham weighed it under her direct appeal for thetruth under her direct appeal for the truth her appeal to his honour her appeal to his honour that s my point fanny assingham braved it for the truth as from him to her from him to any one mrs assingham s face lighted he ll simply he ll insistentlyhave lied maggie brought it out roundly he ll simply he ll insistentlyhave lied it held again her companion who next however with a singlemovement throwing herself on her neck overflowed oh if youknew how you help me maggie had liked her to understand so far as this was possible but had not been slow to see afterwards how the possibility waslimited when one came to think by mysteries she was not tosound this inability in her was indeed not remarkable inasmuchas the princess herself as we have seen was only now in aposition to boast of touching bottom maggie lived inwardly ina consciousness that she could but partly open even to so good afriend and her own visitation of the fuller expanse of whichwas for that matter still going on they had been duskierstill however these recesses of her imagination that nodoubt was what might at present be said for them she had lookedinto them on the eve of her leaving town almost withoutpenetration she had made out in those hours and also of atruth during the days which immediately followed little morethan the strangeness of a relation having for its chief mark whether to be prolonged or not the absence of any intimate result of the crisis she had invited her husband to recognise they had dealt with this crisis again face to face verybriefly the morning after the scene in her room but with theodd consequence of her having appeared merely to leave it on hishands he had received it from her as he might have received abunch of keys or a list of commissions attentive to herinstructions about them but only putting them for the time very carefully and safely into his pocket the instructions hadseemed from day to day to make so little difference for hisbehaviour that is for his speech or his silence to produce asyet so little of the fruit of action he had taken from her onthe spot in a word before going to dress for dinner all shethen had to give after which on the morrow he had asked herfor more a good deal as if she might have renewed her supplyduring the night but he had had at his command for this latterpurpose an air of extraordinary detachment and discretion an airamounting really to an appeal which if she could have broughtherself to describe it vulgarly she would have described ascool just as he himself would have described it in any one elseas cheeky a suggestion that she should trust him on theparticular ground since she didn t on the general neither hisspeech nor his silence struck her as signifying more or less under this pressure than they had seemed to signify for weekspast yet if her sense hadn t been absolutely closed to thepossibility in him of any thought of wounding her she might havetaken his undisturbed manner the perfection of his appearance ofhaving recovered himself for one of those intentions of highimpertinence by the aid of which great people les grandsseigneurs persons of her husband s class and type always knowhow to re establish a violated order it was her one purely good fortune that she could feel thus sureimpertinence to her at any rate was not among the arts on whichhe proposed to throw himself for though he had in so almostmystifying a manner replied to nothing denied nothing explained nothing apologised for nothing he had somehowconveyed to her that this was not because of any determination totreat her case as not worth it there had been consideration on both occasions in the way he had listened to her even thoughat the same time there had been extreme reserve a reserveindeed it was also to be remembered qualified by the fact that on their second and shorter interview in portland place andquite at the end of this passage she had imagined him positivelyproposing to her a temporary accommodation it had been but thematter of something in the depths of the eyes he finally fixedupon her and she had found in it the more she kept it beforeher the tacitly offered sketch of a working arrangement leaveme my reserve don t question it it s all i have just now don t you see so that if you ll make me the concession ofletting me alone with it for as long a time as i require ipromise you something or other grown under cover of it eventhough i don t yet quite make out what as a return for yourpatience she had turned away from him with some such unspokenwords as that in her ear and indeed she had to represent toherself that she had spiritually heard them had to listen tothem still again to explain her particular patience in face ofhis particular failure he hadn t so much as pretended to meetfor an instant the question raised by her of her acceptedignorance of the point in time the period before their ownmarriage from which his intimacy with charlotte dated as anignorance in which he and charlotte had been personallyinterested and to the pitch of consummately protecting foryears each other s interest as a condition so imposed upon herthe fact of its having ceased might have made it on the spot the first article of his defence he had vouchsafed it however nothing better than his longest stare of postponed consideration that tribute he had coldly paid it and maggie might herself havebeen stupefied truly had she not had something to hold on by at her own present ability even provisional to make terms witha chapter of history into which she could but a week before nothave dipped without a mortal chill at the rate at which she wasliving she was getting used hour by hour to these extensions ofview and when she asked herself at fawns to what singleobservation of her own in london the prince had had anaffirmation to oppose she but just failed to focus the smallstrained wife of the moments in question as some panting dancerof a difficult step who had capered before the footlights of anempty theatre to a spectator lounging in a box her best comprehension of amerigo s success in not committinghimself was in her recall meanwhile of the inquiries he hadmade of her on their only return to the subject and which he hadin fact explicitly provoked their return in order to make he hadhad it over with her again the so distinctly remarkable incidentof her interview at home with the little bloomsbury shopman thisanecdote for him had not altogether surprisingly requiredsome straighter telling and the prince s attitude in presence ofit had represented once more his nearest approach to across examination the difficulty in respect to the little manhad been for the question of his motive his motive in writing first in the spirit of retraction to a lady with whom he hadmade a most advantageous bargain and in then coming to see herso that his apology should be personal maggie had felt herexplanation weak but there were the facts and she could give noother left alone after the transaction with the knowledge thathis visitor designed the object bought of him as a birthday giftto her father for maggie confessed freely to having chattered tohim almost as to a friend the vendor of the golden bowl hadacted on a scruple rare enough in vendors of any class andalmost unprecedented in the thrifty children of israel he hadn tliked what he had done and what he had above all made such a good thing of having done at the thought of his purchaser sgood faith and charming presence opposed to that flaw in heracquestion which would make it verily as an offering to a lovedparent a thing of sinister meaning and evil effect he had knownconscientious he had known superstitious visitings had givenway to a whim all the more remarkable to his own commercial mind no doubt from its never having troubled him in other connexions she had recognised the oddity of her adventure and left it toshow for what it was she had not been unconscious on the otherhand that if it hadn t touched amerigo so nearly he would havefound in it matter for some amused reflection he had uttered anextraordinary sound something between a laugh and a howl on hersaying as she had made a point of doing oh most certainly hetold me his reason was because he liked me though sheremained in doubt of whether that inarticulate comment had beenprovoked most by the familiarities she had offered or by thosethat so pictured she had had to endure that the partner of herbargain had yearned to see her again that he had plainly jumpedat a pretext for it this also she had frankly expressed herselfto the prince as having in no snubbing no scandalised butrather in a positively appreciative and indebted spirit notdelayed to make out he had wished ever so seriously to returnher a part of her money and she had wholly declined to receiveit and then he had uttered his hope that she had not at allevents already devoted the crystal cup to the beautiful purposeshe had so kindly and so fortunately named to him it wasn t athing for a present to a person she was fond of for she wouldn twish to give a present that would bring ill luck that had cometo him so that he couldn t rest and he should feel better nowthat he had told her his having led her to act in ignorance waswhat he should have been ashamed of and if she would pardon gracious lady as she was all the liberties he had taken shemight make of the bowl any use in life but that one it was after this that the most extraordinary incident of all ofcourse had occurred his pointing to the two photographs withthe remark that those were persons he knew and that morewonderful still he had made acquaintance with them yearsbefore precisely over the same article the lady on thatoccasion had taken up the fancy of presenting it to thegentleman and the gentleman guessing and dodging ever socleverly had declared that he wouldn t for the world receive anobject under such suspicion he himself the little man hadconfessed wouldn t have minded about them but he had neverforgotten either their talk or their faces the impressionaltogether made by them and if she really wished to know now what had perhaps most moved him it was the thought that sheshould ignorantly have gone in for a thing not good enough forother buyers he had been immensely struck that was anotherpoint with this accident of their turning out after so long friends of hers too they had disappeared and this was the onlylight he had ever had upon them he had flushed up quite red with his recognition with all his responsibility had declaredthat the connexion must have had mysteriously something to dowith the impulse he had obeyed and maggie had made to herhusband while he again stood before her no secret of the shock for herself so suddenly and violently received she had done herbest even while taking it full in the face not to give herselfaway but she wouldn t answer no she wouldn t for what shemight in her agitation have made her informant think he mightthink what he would there had been three or four minutes duringwhich while she asked him question upon question she haddoubtless too little cared and he had spoken for hisremembrance as fully as she could have wished he had spoken oh delightedly for the terms on which his other visitors hadappeared to be with each other and in fact for that convictionof the nature and degree of their intimacy under which in spiteof precautions they hadn t been able to help leaving him he hadobserved and judged and not forgotten he had been sure they weregreat people but no ah no distinctly hadn t liked them ashe liked the signora principessa certainly she had created novagueness about that he had been in possession of her name andaddress for sending her both her cup and her account but theothers he had only always wondered about he had been sure theywould never come back and as to the time of their visit hecould place it positively to a day by reason of a transactionof importance recorded in his books that had occurred but a fewhours later he had left her in short definitely rejoicing thathe had been able to make up to her for not having been quite square over their little business by rendering her sounexpectedly the service of this information his joy moreover was as much as amerigo would a matter of the personal interestwith which her kindness gentleness grace her charmingpresence and easy humanity and familiarity had inspired him allof which while in thought maggie went over it again and again oh over any imputable rashness of her own immediate passionand pain as well as over the rest of the straight little storyshe had after all to tell might very conceivably make a longsum for the prince to puzzle out there were meanwhile after the castledeans and those invited tomeet them had gone and before mrs rance and the lutches hadcome three or four days during which she was to learn the fullextent of her need not to be penetrable and then it was indeedthat she felt all the force and threw herself upon all the help of the truth she had confided several nights earlier to fannyassingham she had known it in advance had warned herself of itwhile the house was full charlotte had designs upon her of anature best known to herself and was only waiting for the betteropportunity of their finding themselves less companioned thisconsciousness had been exactly at the bottom of maggie s wish tomultiply their spectators there were moments for her positively moments of planned postponement of evasion scarcelyless disguised than studied during which she turned over withanxiety the different ways there being two or three possibleones in which her young stepmother might at need seek to workupon her amerigo s not having told her of his passage with hiswife gave for maggie altogether a new aspect to charlotte sconsciousness and condition an aspect with which forapprehension for wonder and even at moments inconsequentlyenough for something like compassion the princess had now toreckon she asked herself for she was capable of that what hehad meant by keeping the sharer of his guilt in the dark about amatter touching her otherwise so nearly what he had meant thatis for this unmistakably mystified personage herself maggiecould imagine what he had meant for her all sorts of thinkablethings whether things of mere form or things of sincerity things of pity or things of prudence he had meant for instance in all probability primarily to conjure away any suchappearance of a changed relation between the two women as hisfather in law might notice and follow up it would have been opento him however given the pitch of their intimacy to avert thisdanger by some more conceivable course with charlotte since anearnest warning in fact the full freedom of alarm that of hisinsisting to her on the peril of suspicion incurred and on theimportance accordingly of outward peace at any price would havebeen the course really most conceivable instead of warning andadvising he had reassured and deceived her so that our youngwoman who had been from far back by the habit if her nature as much on her guard against sacrificing others as if she feltthe great trap of life mainly to be set for one s doing so nowfound herself attaching her fancy to that side of the situationof the exposed pair which involved for themselves at least thesacrifice of the least fortunate she never at present thought of what amerigo might beintending without the reflection by the same stroke that whatever this quantity he was leaving still more to her owningenuity he was helping her when the thing came to the test only by the polished possibly almost too polished surface hismanner to his wife wore for an admiring world and that surely was entitled to scarcely more than the praise of negativediplomacy he was keeping his manner right as she had related tomrs assingham the case would have been beyond calculation truly if on top of everything he had allowed it to go wrong she had hours of exaltation indeed when the meaning of all thispressed in upon her as a tacit vow from him to abide withoutquestion by whatever she should be able to achieve or think fitto prescribe then it was that even while holding her breath forthe awe of it she truly felt almost able enough for anything itwas as if she had passed in a time incredibly short from beingnothing for him to being all it was as if rightly noted everyturn of his head every tone of his voice in these days mightmean that there was but one way in which a proud man reduced toabjection could hold himself during those of maggie s vigils inwhich that view loomed largest the image of her husband that itthus presented to her gave out a beauty for the revelation ofwhich she struck herself as paying if anything all too little to make sure of it to make sure of the beauty shining out of thehumility and of the humility lurking in all the pride of hispresence she would have gone the length of paying more yet ofpaying with difficulties and anxieties compared to which thoseactually before her might have been as superficial as headachesor rainy days the point at which these exaltations dropped however was thepoint at which it was apt to come over her that if hercomplications had been greater the question of paying would havebeen limited still less to the liabilities of her own pocket thecomplications were verily great enough whether for ingenuitiesor sublimities so long as she had to come back to it so oftenthat charlotte all the while could only be struggling withsecrets sharper than her own it was odd how that certainty againand again determined and coloured her wonderments of detail thequestion for instance of how amerigo in snatched opportunitiesof conference put the haunted creature off with falseexplanations met her particular challenges and evaded if thatwas what he did do her particular demands even the convictionthat charlotte was but awaiting some chance really to test hertrouble upon her lover s wife left maggie s sense meanwhile openas to the sight of gilt wires and bruised wings the spacious butsuspended cage the home of eternal unrest of pacings beatings shakings all so vain into which the baffled consciousnesshelplessly resolved itself the cage was the deluded condition and maggie as having known delusion rather understood thenature of cages she walked round charlotte s cautiously and ina very wide circle and when inevitably they had to communicateshe felt herself comparatively outside on the breast ofnature and saw her companion s face as that of a prisonerlooking through bars so it was that through bars bars richlygilt but firmly though discreetly planted charlotte finallystruck her as making a grim attempt from which at first theprincess drew back as instinctively as if the door of the cagehad suddenly been opened from within xxxvithey had been alone that evening alone as a party of six andfour of them after dinner under suggestion not to be resisted sat down to bridge in the smoking room they had passedtogether to that apartment on rising from table charlotte andmrs assingham alike indulgent always to tobacco and in factpractising an emulation which as fanny said would for herself had the colonel not issued an interdict based on the fear of herstealing his cigars have stopped only at the short pipe herecards had with inevitable promptness asserted their rule thegame forming itself as had often happened before of mr ververwith mrs assingham for partner and of the prince with mrs verver the colonel who had then asked of maggie license torelieve his mind of a couple of letters for the earliest post outon the morrow was addressing himself to this task at the otherend of the room and the princess herself had welcomed thecomparatively hushed hour for the bridge players were seriousand silent much in the mood of a tired actress who has the goodfortune to be off while her mates are on almost long enoughfor a nap on the property sofa in the wing maggie s nap had shebeen able to snatch forty winks would have been of the spiritrather than of the sense yet as she subsided near a lamp withthe last salmon coloured french periodical she was to fail forrefreshment even of that sip of independence there was no question for her as she found of closing her eyesand getting away they strayed back to life in the stillness over the top of her review she could lend herself to none ofthose refinements of the higher criticism with which its pagesbristled she was there where her companions were there againand more than ever there it was as if of a sudden they hadbeen made in their personal intensity and their rare complexityof relation freshly importunate to her it was the first eveningthere had been no one else mrs rance and the lutches were duethe next day but meanwhile the facts of the situation wereupright for her round the green cloth and the silver flambeaux the fact of her father s wife s lover facing his mistress thefact of her father sitting all unsounded and unblinking betweenthem the fact of charlotte keeping it up keeping up everything across the table with her husband beside her the fact of fannyassingham wonderful creature placed opposite to the three andknowing more about each probably when one came to think thaneither of them knew of either erect above all for her was thesharp edged fact of the relation of the whole group individuallyand collectively to herself herself so speciously eliminatedfor the hour but presumably more present to the attention ofeach than the next card to be played yes under that imputation to her sense they sat theimputation of wondering beneath and behind all their apparentlystraight play if she weren t really watching them from hercorner and consciously as might be said holding them in herhand she was asking herself at last how they could bear it for though cards were as nought to her and she could follow no move so that she was always on such occasions out of the party theystruck her as conforming alike in the matter of gravity andpropriety to the stiff standard of the house her father sheknew was a high adept one of the greatest she had been ever in her stupidity his small his sole despair amerigo excelledeasily as he understood and practised every art that couldbeguile large leisure mrs assingham and charlotte moreover were accounted as good as members of a sex incapable of thenobler consistency could be therefore evidently they were not all so up to their usual form merely passing it off whether forher or for themselves and the amount of enjoyed or at leastachieved security represented by so complete a conquest ofappearances was what acted on her nerves precisely with a kindof provocative force she found herself for five minutes thrilling with the idea of the prodigious effect that just asshe sat there near them she had at her command with the sensethat if she were but different oh ever so different all thishigh decorum would hang by a hair there reigned for her absolutely during these vertiginous moments that fascination ofthe monstrous that temptation of the horribly possible which weso often trace by its breaking out suddenly lest it should gofurther in unexplained retreats and reactions after it had been thus vividly before her for a little that springing up under her wrong and making them all start stare andturn pale she might sound out their doom in a single sentence asentence easy to choose among several of the lurid after she hadfaced that blinding light and felt it turn to blackness she rosefrom her place laying aside her magazine and moved slowly roundthe room passing near the card players and pausing an instantbehind the chairs in turn silent and discreet she bent a vaguemild face upon them as if to signify that little as shefollowed their doings she wished them well and she took fromeach across the table in the common solemnity an upwardrecognition which she was to carry away with her on her movingout to the terrace a few minutes later her father and herhusband mrs assingham and charlotte had done nothing but meether eyes yet the difference in these demonstrations made each aseparate passage which was all the more wonderful since withthe secret behind every face they had alike tried to look at herthrough it and in denial of it it all left her as she wandered off with the strangest ofimpressions the sense forced upon her as never yet of anappeal a positive confidence from the four pairs of eyes thatwas deeper than any negation and that seemed to speak on thepart of each of some relation to be contrived by her a relationwith herself which would spare the individual the danger theactual present strain of the relation with the others theythus tacitly put it upon her to be disposed of the wholecomplexity of their peril and she promptly saw why because shewas there and there just as she was to lift it off them andtake it to charge herself with it as the scapegoat of old ofwhom she had once seen a terrible picture had been charged withthe sins of the people and had gone forth into the desert to sinkunder his burden and die that indeed wasn t their design andtheir interest that she should sink under hers it wouldn t betheir feeling that she should do anything but live live onsomehow for their benefit and even as much as possible in theircompany to keep proving to them that they had truly escaped andthat she was still there to simplify this idea of hersimplifying and of their combined struggle dim as yet butsteadily growing toward the perception of her adopting it fromthem clung to her while she hovered on the terrace where thesummer night was so soft that she scarce needed the light shawlshe had picked up several of the long windows of the occupiedrooms stood open to it and the light came out in vague shaftsand fell upon the old smooth stones the hour was moonless andstarless and the air heavy and still which was why in herevening dress she need fear no chill and could get away in theouter darkness from that provocation of opportunity which hadassaulted her within on her sofa as a beast might have leapedat her throat nothing in fact was stranger than the way in which when she hadremained there a little her companions watched by her throughone of the windows actually struck her as almost consciously andgratefully safer they might have been really charming as theyshowed in the beautiful room and charlotte certainly as always magnificently handsome and supremely distinguished they mighthave been figures rehearsing some play of which she herself wasthe author they might even for the happy appearance theycontinued to present have been such figures as would by thestrong note of character in each fill any author with thecertitude of success especially of their own histrionic theymight in short have represented any mystery they would the pointbeing predominantly that the key to the mystery the key thatcould wind and unwind it without a snap of the spring was therein her pocket or rather no doubt clasped at this crisis in herhand and pressed as she walked back and forth to her breast she walked to the end and far out of the light she returned andsaw the others still where she had left them she passed roundthe house and looked into the drawing room lighted also butempty now and seeming to speak the more in its own voice ofall the possibilities she controlled spacious and splendid likea stage again awaiting a drama it was a scene she might people by the press of her spring either with serenities and dignitiesand decencies or with terrors and shames and ruins things asugly as those formless fragments of her golden bowl she wastrying so hard to pick up she continued to walk and continued to pause she stopped afreshfor the look into the smoking room and by this time it was asif the recognition had of itself arrested her she saw as in apicture with the temptation she had fled from quite extinct whyit was she had been able to give herself so little from thefirst to the vulgar heat of her wrong she might fairly as shewatched them have missed it as a lost thing have yearned forit for the straight vindictive view the rights of resentment the rages of jealousy the protests of passion as for somethingshe had been cheated of not least a range of feelings which formany women would have meant so much but which for her husband swife for her father s daughter figured nothing nearer toexperience than a wild eastern caravan looming into view withcrude colours in the sun fierce pipes in the air high spearsagainst the sky all a thrill a natural joy to mingle with butturning off short before it reached her and plunging into otherdefiles she saw at all events why horror itself had almostfailed her the horror that foreshadowed in advance would byher thought have made everything that was unaccustomed in hercry out with pain the horror of finding evil seated all at itsease where she had only dreamed of good the horror of the thinghideously behind behind so much trusted so much pretended nobleness cleverness tenderness it was the first sharp falsityshe had known in her life to touch at all or be touched by ithad met her like some bad faced stranger surprised in one of thethick carpeted corridors of a house of quiet on a sundayafternoon and yet yes amazingly she had been able to look atterror and disgust only to know that she must put away from herthe bitter sweet of their freshness the sight from the window of the group so constituted told her why told her how named toher as with hard lips named straight at her so that she musttake it full in the face that other possible relation to thewhole fact which alone would bear upon her irresistibly it wasextraordinary they positively brought home to her that to feelabout them in any of the immediate inevitable assuaging ways the ways usually open to innocence outraged and generositybetrayed would have been to give them up and that giving themup was marvellously not to be thought of she had never fromthe first hour of her state of acquired conviction given them upso little as now though she was no doubt as the consequence ofa step taken a few minutes later to invoke the conception ofdoing that if might be even less she had resumed her walk stopping here and there while she rested on the cool smoothstone balustrade to draw it out in the course of which after alittle she passed again the lights of the empty drawing room andpaused again for what she saw and felt there it was not at once however that this became quite concrete that was the effect of her presently making out that charlottewas in the room launched and erect there in the middle andlooking about her that she had evidently just come round to it from her card table by one of the passages with theexpectation to all appearance of joining her stepdaughter shehad pulled up at seeing the great room empty maggie not havingpassed out on leaving the group in a manner to be observed sodefinite a quest of her with the bridge party interrupted oraltered for it was an impression that fairly assailed theprincess and to which something of attitude and aspect of theair of arrested pursuit and purpose in charlotte together withthe suggestion of her next vague movements quickly added itsmeaning this meaning was that she had decided that she had beeninfinitely conscious of maggie s presence before that she knewthat she would at last find her alone and that she wanted her for some reason enough to have presumably called on bobassingham for aid he had taken her chair and let her go and thearrangement was for maggie a signal proof of her earnestness ofthe energy in fact that though superficially commonplace in asituation in which people weren t supposed to be watching eachother was what affected our young woman on the spot as abreaking of bars the splendid shining supple creature was out ofthe cage was at large and the question now almost grotesquelyrose of whether she mightn t by some art just where she was andbefore she could go further be hemmed in and secured it wouldhave been for a moment in this case a matter of quickly closingthe windows and giving the alarm with poor maggie s sense that though she couldn t know what she wanted of her it was enoughfor trepidation that at these firm hands anything should be tosay nothing of the sequel of a flight taken again along theterrace even under the shame of the confessed feebleness of suchevasions on the part of an outraged wife it was to thisfeebleness none the less that the outraged wife had presentlyresorted the most that could be said for her being as she feltwhile she finally stopped short at a distance that she could atany rate resist her abjection sufficiently not to sneak into thehouse by another way and safely reach her room she had literallycaught herself in the act of dodging and ducking and it told herthere vividly in a single word what she had all along beenmost afraid of she had been afraid of the particular passage with charlotte thatwould determine her father s wife to take him into her confidenceas she couldn t possibly as yet have done to prepare for him astatement of her wrong to lay before him the infamy of what shewas apparently suspected of this should she have made up hermind to do it would rest on a calculation the thought of whichevoked strangely other possibilities and visions it would showher as sufficiently believing in her grasp of her husband to beable to assure herself that with his daughter thrown on thedefensive with maggie s cause and maggie s word in fine against her own it wasn t maggie s that would most certainlycarry the day such a glimpse of her conceivable idea whichwould be founded on reasons all her own reasons of experienceand assurance impenetrable to others but intimately familiar toherself such a glimpse opened out wide as soon as it had comeinto view for if so much as this was still firm ground betweenthe elder pair if the beauty of appearances had been soconsistently preserved it was only the golden bowl as maggieherself knew it that had been broken the breakage stood not forany wrought discomposure among the triumphant three it stoodmerely for the dire deformity of her attitude toward them shewas unable at the minute of course fully to measure thedifference thus involved for her and it remained inevitably anagitating image the way it might be held over her that if shedidn t of her own prudence satisfy charlotte as to thereference in her mocking spirit of so much of the unuttered andunutterable of the constantly and unmistakably implied herfather would be invited without further ceremony to recommend herto do so but any confidence any latent operating insolence that mrs verver should thanks to her large native resources continue to be possessed of and to hold in reserve glimmeredsuddenly as a possible working light and seemed to offer formeeting her a new basis and something like a new system maggie felt truly a rare contraction of the heart on makingout the next instant what the new system would probably have tobe and she had practically done that before perceiving that thething she feared had already taken place charlotte extendingher search appeared now to define herself vaguely in thedistance of this after an instant the princess was sure though the darkness was thick for the projected clearness of thesmoking room windows had presently contributed its help herfriend came slowly into that circle having also for herself bythis time not indistinguishably discovered that maggie was onthe terrace maggie from the end saw her stop before one of thewindows to look at the group within and then saw her come nearerand pause again still with a considerable length of the placebetween them yes charlotte had seen she was watching her from afar and hadstopped now to put her further attention to the test her facewas fixed on her through the night she was the creature who hadescaped by force from her cage yet there was in her whole motionassuredly even as so dimly discerned a kind of portentousintelligent stillness she had escaped with an intention butwith an intention the more definite that it could so accord withquiet measures the two women at all events only hovered there for these first minutes face to face over their interval andexchanging no sign the intensity of their mutual look might havepierced the night and maggie was at last to start with thescared sense of having thus yielded to doubt to dread tohesitation for a time that with no other proof needed wouldhave completely given her away how long had she stood staring a single minute or five long enough in any case to have feltherself absolutely take from her visitor something that thelatter threw upon her irresistibly by this effect of silence by this effect of waiting and watching by this effect unmistakably of timing her indecision and her fear if then scared and hanging back she had as was so evident sacrificedall past pretences it would have been with the instant knowledgeof an immense advantage gained that charlotte finally saw hercome on maggie came on with her heart in her hands she came onwith the definite prevision throbbing like the tick of a watch of a doom impossibly sharp and hard but to which after lookingat it with her eyes wide open she had none the less bowed herhead by the time she was at her companion s side for thatmatter by the time charlotte had without a motion without aword simply let her approach and stand there her head wasalready on the block so that the consciousness that everythinghad now gone blurred all perception of whether or no the axe hadfallen oh the advantage it was perfectly enough in truth with mrs verver for what was maggie s own sense but that ofhaving been thrown over on her back with her neck from thefirst half broken and her helpless face staring up thatposition only could account for the positive grimace of weaknessand pain produced there by charlotte s dignity i ve come to join you i thought you would be here oh yes i m here maggie heard herself return a little flatly it s too close in doors very but close even here charlotte was still and grave shehad even uttered her remark about the temperature with anexpressive weight that verged upon solemnity so that maggie reduced to looking vaguely about at the sky could only feel hernot fail of her purpose the air s heavy as if with thunder ithink there ll be a storm she made the suggestion to carry offan awkwardness which was a part always of her companion sgain but the awkwardness didn t diminish in the silence thatfollowed charlotte had said nothing in reply her brow was darkas with a fixed expression and her high elegance her handsomehead and long straight neck testified through the dusk totheir inveterate completeness and noble erectness it was as ifwhat she had come out to do had already begun and when as aconsequence maggie had said helplessly don t you wantsomething won t you have my shawl everything might havecrumbled away in the comparative poverty of the tribute mrs verver s rejection of it had the brevity of a sign that theyhadn t closed in for idle words just as her dim serious face uninterruptedly presented until they moved again might haverepresented the success with which she watched all her messagepenetrate they presently went back the way she had come but shestopped maggie again within range of the smoking room window andmade her stand where the party at cards would be before her sideby side for three minutes they fixed this picture of quietharmonies the positive charm of it and as might have been said the full significance which as was now brought home to maggie could be no more after all than a matter of interpretation differing always for a different interpreter as she herself hadhovered in sight of it a quarter of an hour before it would havebeen a thing for her to show charlotte to show in righteousirony in reproach too stern for anything but silence but now itwas she who was being shown it and shown it by charlotte andshe saw quickly enough that as charlotte showed it so she mustat present submissively seem to take it the others were absorbed and unconscious either silent overtheir game or dropping remarks unheard on the terrace and it wasto her father s quiet face discernibly expressive of nothingthat was in his daughter s mind that our young woman s attentionwas most directly given his wife and his daughter were bothclosely watching him and to which of them could he have beennotified of this would his raised eyes first all impulsively have responded in which of them would he have felt it mostimportant to destroy for his clutch at the equilibrium any germof uneasiness not yet since his marriage had maggie so sharplyand so formidably known her old possession of him as a thingdivided and contested she was looking at him by charlotte sleave and under charlotte s direction quite in fact as if theparticular way she should look at him were prescribed to her quite even as if she had been defied to look at him in anyother it came home to her too that the challenge wasn t asmight be said in his interest and for his protection but pressingly insistently in charlotte s for that of her securityat any price she might verily by this dumb demonstration havebeen naming to maggie the price naming it as a question formaggie herself a sum of money that she properly was to find she must remain safe and maggie must pay what she was to paywith being her own affair straighter than ever thus the princess again felt it all putupon her and there was a minute just a supreme instant duringwhich there burned in her a wild wish that her father would onlylook up it throbbed for these seconds as a yearning appeal tohim she would chance it that is if he would but just raise hiseyes and catch them across the larger space standing in theouter dark together then he might be affected by the sight taking them as they were he might make some sign she scarceknew what that would save her save her from being the one thisway to pay all he might somehow show a preference distinguishing between them might out of pity for her signalto her that this extremity of her effort for him was more than heasked that represented maggie s one little lapse fromconsistency the sole small deflection in the whole course of herscheme it had come to nothing the next minute for the dearman s eyes had never moved and charlotte s hand promptly passedinto her arm had already had very firmly drawn her on quite for that matter as from some sudden some equal perception onher part too of the more ways than one in which their impressioncould appeal they retraced their steps along the rest of theterrace turning the corner of the house and presently cameabreast of the other windows those of the pompous drawing room still lighted and still empty here charlotte again paused andit was again as if she were pointing out what maggie had observedfor herself the very look the place had of being vivid in itsstillness of having with all its great objects as ordered andbalanced as for a formal reception been appointed for some hightransaction some real affair of state in presence of thisopportunity she faced her companion once more she traced in herthe effect of everything she had already communicated shesignified with the same success that the terrace and the sullennight would bear too meagre witness to the completion of heridea soon enough then within the room under the old lustres ofvenice and the eyes of the several great portraits more or lesscontemporary with these that awaited on the walls of fawns theirfinal far migration soon enough maggie found herself staring and at first all too gaspingly at the grand total to which eachseparate demand mrs verver had hitherto made upon her howevershe had made it now amounted i ve been wanting and longer than you d perhaps believe to puta question to you for which no opportunity has seemed to me yetquite so good as this it would have been easier perhaps if youhad struck me as in the least disposed ever to give me one ihave to take it now you see as i find it they stood in thecentre of the immense room and maggie could feel that the sceneof life her imagination had made of it twenty minutes before wasby this time sufficiently peopled these few straight wordsfilled it to its uttermost reaches and nothing was now absentfrom her consciousness either of the part she was called uponto play in it charlotte had marched straight in dragging herrich train she rose there beautiful and free with her wholeaspect and action attuned to the firmness of her speech maggiehad kept the shawl she had taken out with her and clutching ittight in her nervousness drew it round her as if huddling in itfor shelter covering herself with it for humility she lookedout as from under an improvised hood the sole headgear of somepoor woman at somebody s proud door she waited even like thepoor woman she met her friend s eyes with recognitions shecouldn t suppress she might sound it as she could whatquestion then everything in her from head to foot crowded itupon charlotte that she knew she knew too well that she wasshowing so that successful vagueness to save some scrap of herdignity from the imminence of her defeat was already a lostcause and the one thing left was if possible at any cost eventhat of stupid inconsequence to try to look as if she weren tafraid if she could but appear at all not afraid she mightappear a little not ashamed that is not ashamed to be afraid which was the kind of shame that could be fastened on her itbeing fear all the while that moved her her challenge at anyrate her wonder her terror the blank blurred surface whatever it was that she presented became a mixture that ceasedto signify for to the accumulated advantage by which charlottewas at present sustained her next words themselves had little toadd have you any ground of complaint of me is there any wrong youconsider i ve done you i feel at last that i ve a right to askyou their eyes had to meet on it and to meet long maggie s avoidedat least the disgrace of looking away what makes you want toask it my natural desire to know you ve done that for so long littlejustice maggie waited a moment for so long you mean you vethought i mean my dear that i ve seen i ve seen week after week that you seemed to be thinking of something that perplexed orworried you is it anything for which i m in any degreeresponsible maggie summoned all her powers what in the world should it be ah that s not for me to imagine and i should be very sorry tohave to try to say i m aware of no point whatever at which i mayhave failed you said charlotte nor of any at which i may havefailed any one in whom i can suppose you sufficiently interestedto care if i ve been guilty of some fault i ve committed it allunconsciously and am only anxious to hear from you honestlyabout it but if i ve been mistaken as to what i speak of thedifference more and more marked as i ve thought in all yourmanner to me why obviously so much the better no form ofcorrection received from you could give me greater satisfaction she spoke it struck her companion with rising withextraordinary ease as if hearing herself say it all besidesseeing the way it was listened to helped her from point topoint she saw she was right that this was the tone for her totake and the thing for her to do the thing as to which she wasprobably feeling that she had in advance in her delays anduncertainties much exaggerated the difficulty the difficultywas small and it grew smaller as her adversary continued toshrink she was not only doing as she wanted but had by thistime effectively done it and hung it up all of which butdeepened maggie s sense of the sharp and simple need now ofseeing her through to the end if you ve been mistaken yousay and the princess but barely faltered you have beenmistaken charlotte looked at her splendidly hard you re perfectly sureit s all my mistake all i can say is that you ve received a false impression ah then so much the better from the moment i had received it iknew i must sooner or later speak of it for that you see is systematically my way and now charlotte added you make meglad i ve spoken i thank you very much it was strange how for maggie too with this the difficultyseemed to sink her companion s acceptance of her denial was likea general pledge not to keep things any worse for her than theyessentially had to be it positively helped her to build up herfalsehood to which accordingly she contributed another block i ve affected you evidently quite accidentally in some way ofwhich i ve been all unaware i ve not felt at any time thatyou ve wronged me how could i come within a mile charlotte inquired of such apossibility maggie with her eyes on her more easily now made no attempt tosay she said after a little something more to the presentpoint i accuse you i accuse you of nothing ah that s lucky charlotte had brought this out with the richness almost ofgaiety and maggie to go on had to think with her ownintensity of amerigo to think how he on his side had had togo through with his lie to her how it was for his wife he haddone so and how his doing so had given her the clue and set herthe example he must have had his own difficulty about it andshe was not after all falling below him it was in fact as if thanks to her hovering image of him confronted with thisadmirable creature even as she was confronted there glowed uponher from afar yet straight and strong a deep explanatory lightwhich covered the last inch of the ground he had given hersomething to conform to and she hadn t unintelligently turned onhim gone back on him as he would have said by notconforming they were together thus he and she close closetogether whereas charlotte though rising there radiantly beforeher was really off in some darkness of space that would steepher in solitude and harass her with care the heart of theprincess swelled accordingly even in her abasement she hadkept in tune with the right and something certainly somethingthat might be like a rare flower snatched from an impossibleledge would and possibly soon come of it for her the right the right yes it took this extraordinary form of herhumbugging as she had called it to the end it was only aquestion of not by a hair s breadth deflecting into the truth so supremely was she braced you must take it from me thatyour anxiety rests quite on a misconception you must take itfrom me that i ve never at any moment fancied i could suffer byyou and marvellously she kept it up not only kept it up butimproved on it you must take it from me that i ve never thoughtof you but as beautiful wonderful and good which is all ithink that you can possibly ask charlotte held her a moment longer she needed not then to haveappeared only tactless the last word it s much more my dear than i dreamed of asking i only wanted your denial well then you have it upon your honour upon my honour and she made a point even our young woman of not turning away her grip of her shawl had loosened she had let it fall behindher but she stood there for anything more and till the weightshould be lifted with which she saw soon enough what more was tocome she saw it in charlotte s face and felt it make betweenthem in the air a chill that completed the coldness of theirconscious perjury will you kiss me on it then she couldn t say yes but she didn t say no what availed herstill however was to measure in her passivity how much toofar charlotte had come to retreat but there was somethingdifferent also something for which while her cheek received theprodigious kiss she had her opportunity the sight of theothers who having risen from their cards to join the absentmembers of their party had reached the open door at the end ofthe room and stopped short evidently in presence of thedemonstration that awaited them her husband and her father werein front and charlotte s embrace of her which wasn t to bedistinguished for them either she felt from her embrace ofcharlotte took on with their arrival a high publicity xxxviiher father had asked her three days later in an interval ofcalm how she was affected in the light of their reappearanceand of their now perhaps richer fruition by dotty and kitty andby the once formidable mrs rance and the consequence of thisinquiry had been for the pair just such another strolltogether away from the rest of the party and off into the park as had asserted its need to them on the occasion of the previousvisit of these anciently more agitating friends that of theirlong talk on a sequestered bench beneath one of the great trees when the particular question had come up for them the thenpurblind discussion of which at their enjoyed leisure maggiehad formed the habit of regarding as the first beginning oftheir present situation the whirligig of time had thus broughtround for them again on their finding themselves face to facewhile the others were gathering for tea on the terrace the sameodd impulse quietly to slope so adam verver himself as theywent familiarly expressed it that had acted in its way ofold acted for the distant autumn afternoon and for the sharpnessof their since so outlived crisis it might have been funny tothem now that the presence of mrs rance and the lutches andwith symptoms too at that time less developed had once fortheir anxiety and their prudence constituted a crisis it mighthave been funny that these ladies could ever have figured totheir imagination as a symbol of dangers vivid enough toprecipitate the need of a remedy this amount of entertainmentand assistance they were indeed disposed to extract from theiractual impressions they had been finding it for months past bymaggie s view a resource and a relief to talk with an approachto intensity when they met of all the people they weren treally thinking of and didn t really care about the people withwhom their existence had begun almost to swarm and they closedin at present round the spectres of their past as they permittedthemselves to describe the three ladies with a better imitationof enjoying their theme than they had been able to achieve certainly during the stay for instance of the castledeans thecastledeans were a new joke comparatively and they had had always to maggie s view to teach themselves the way of it whereas the detroit the providence party rebounding so fromprovidence from detroit was an old and ample one of which themost could be made and as to which a humorous insistence could beguarded sharp and sudden moreover this afternoon had been theirwell nigh confessed desire just to rest together a little asfrom some strain long felt but never named to rest as whoshould say shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand each pair ofeyes so yearningly and indeed what could it be but so wearily closed as to render the collapse safe from detection by the otherpair it was positively as if in short the inward felicity oftheir being once more perhaps only for half an hour simplydaughter and father had glimmered out for them and they hadpicked up the pretext that would make it easiest they werehusband and wife oh so immensely as regards other persons but after they had dropped again on their old bench consciousthat the party on the terrace augmented as in the past byneighbours would do beautifully without them it was wonderfullylike their having got together into some boat and paddled offfrom the shore where husbands and wives luxuriant complications made the air too tropical in the boat they were father anddaughter and poor dotty and kitty supplied abundantly for theirsituation the oars or the sail why into the bargain for thatmatter this came to maggie couldn t they always live so far asthey lived together in a boat she felt in her face with thequestion the breath of a possibility that soothed her theyneeded only know each other henceforth in the unmarriedrelation that other sweet evening in the same place he hadbeen as unmarried as possible which had kept down so to speak the quantity of change in their state well then that othersweet evening was what the present sweet evening would resemble with the quite calculable effect of an exquisite inwardrefreshment they had after all whatever happened always andever each other each other that was the hidden treasure and thesaving truth to do exactly what they would with a provisionfull of possibilities who could tell as yet what thanks toit they wouldn t have done before the end they had meanwhile been tracing together in the golden air that toward six o clock of a july afternoon hung about the massedkentish woods several features of the social evolution of herold playmates still beckoned on it would seem by unattainableideals still falling back beyond the sea to their nativeseats for renewals of the moral financial conversational onescarce knew what to call it outfit and again and for everreappearing like a tribe of wandering jewesses our couple hadfinally exhausted however the study of these annals and maggiewas to take up after a drop a different matter or one at leastwith which the immediate connection was not at first apparent were you amused at me just now when i wondered what otherpeople could wish to struggle for did you think me she askedwith some earnestness well fatuous fatuous he seemed at a loss i mean sublime in our happiness as if looking down from aheight or rather sublime in our general position that s whati mean she spoke as from the habit of her anxious consciencesomething that disposed her frequently to assure herself for herhuman commerce of the state of the books of the spirit because i don t at all want she explained to be blinded ormade sniffy by any sense of a social situation her fatherlistened to this declaration as if the precautions of her generalmercy could still as they betrayed themselves have surprisesfor him to say nothing of a charm of delicacy and beauty hemight have been wishing to see how far she could go and where shewould all touchingly to him arrive but she waited a little asif made nervous precisely by feeling him depend too much onwhat she said they were avoiding the serious standing off anxiously from the real and they fell again and again as ifto disguise their precaution itself into the tone of the timethat came back to them from their other talk when they hadshared together this same refuge don t you remember she wenton how when they were here before i broke it to you that iwasn t so very sure we ourselves had the thing itself he did his best to do so had you mean a social situation yes after fanny assingham had first broken it to me that atthe rate we were going we should never have one which was what put us on charlotte oh yes they had had itover quite often enough for him easily to remember maggie had another pause taking it from him that he now couldboth affirm and admit without wincing that they had been attheir critical moment put on charlotte it was as if thisrecognition had been threshed out between them as fundamental tothe honest view of their success well she continued irecall how i felt about kitty and dotty that even if we hadalready then been more placed or whatever you may call what weare now it still wouldn t have been an excuse for wondering whyothers couldn t obligingly leave me more exalted by having themselves smaller ideas for those she said were thefeelings we used to have oh yes he responded philosophically i remember the feelingswe used to have maggie appeared to wish to plead for them a little in tenderretrospect as if they had been also respectable it was badenough i thought to have no sympathy in your heart when you hada position but it was worse to be sublime about it as i was soafraid as i m in fact still afraid of being when it wasn t eventhere to support one and she put forth again the earnestnessshe might have been taking herself as having outlived became forit which was doubtless too often even now her danger almostsententious one must always whether or no have someimagination of the states of others of what they may feeldeprived of however she added kitty and dotty couldn timagine we were deprived of anything and now and now butshe stopped as for indulgence to their wonder and envy and now they see still more that we can have got everything and kept everything and yet not be proud no we re not proud she answered after a moment i m not surethat we re quite proud enough yet she changed the next instantthat subject too she could only do so however by harkingback as if it had been a fascination she might have beenwishing under this renewed this still more suggestivevisitation to keep him with her for remounting the stream oftime and dipping again for the softness of the water into thecontracted basin of the past we talked about it we talkedabout it you don t remember so well as i you too didn t know and it was beautiful of you like kitty and dotty you too thoughtwe had a position and were surprised when i thought we oughtto have told them we weren t doing for them what they supposed in fact maggie pursued we re not doing it now we re not yousee really introducing them i mean not to the people theywant then what do you call the people with whom they re now havingtea it made her quite spring round that s just what you asked methe other time one of the days there was somebody and i toldyou i didn t call anybody anything i remember that such people the people we made so welcome didn t count that fanny assingham knew they didn t she hadawakened his daughter the echo and on the bench there asbefore he nodded his head amusedly he kept nervously shakinghis foot yes they were only good enough the people who came for us i remember he said again that was the way it allhappened that was the way that was the way and you asked me maggieadded if i didn t think we ought to tell them tell mrs rance in particular i mean that we had been entertaining her up tothen under false pretences precisely but you said she wouldn t have understood to which you replied that in that case you were like her youdidn t understand no no but i remember how about our having in our benightedinnocence no position you quite crushed me with yourexplanation well then said maggie with every appearance of delight i llcrush you again i told you that you by yourself had one therewas no doubt of that you were different from me you had thesame one you always had and then i asked you her father concurred why in that caseyou hadn t the same then indeed you did he had brought her face round to himbefore and this held it covering him with its kindledbrightness the result of the attested truth of their being ablethus in talk to live again together what i replied was that ihad lost my position by my marriage that one i know how isaw it would never come back i had done something to it ididn t quite know what given it away somehow and yet not asthen appeared really got my return i had been assured alwaysby dear fanny that i could get it only i must wake up so i wastrying you see to wake up trying very hard yes and to a certain extent you succeeded as also in wakingme but you made much he said of your difficulty to whichhe added it s the only case i remember mag of you ever makinganything of a difficulty she kept her eyes on him a moment that i was so happy as iwas that you were so happy as you were well you admitted maggie kept it up that that was a gooddifficulty you confessed that our life did seem to bebeautiful he thought a moment yes i may very well have confessed it forso it did seem to me but he guarded himself with his dim hiseasier smile what do you want to put on me now only that we used to wonder that we were wondering then if ourlife wasn t perhaps a little selfish this also for a time muchat his leisure adam verver retrospectively fixed because fannyassingham thought so oh no she never thought she couldn t think if she would anything of that sort she only thinks people are sometimesfools maggie developed she doesn t seem to think so muchabout their being wrong wrong that is in the sense of beingwicked she doesn t the princess further adventured quite somuch mind their being wicked i see i see and yet it might have been for his daughter thathe didn t so very vividly see then she only thought us fools oh no i don t say that i m speaking of our being selfish and that comes under the head of the wickedness fanny condones oh i don t say she condones a scruple in maggie raised itscrest besides i m speaking of what was her father showed however after a little that he had not beenreached by this discrimination his thoughts were resting for themoment where they had settled look here mag he saidreflectively i ain t selfish i ll be blowed if i m selfish well maggie if he would talk of that could also pronounce then father i am oh shucks said adam verver to whom the vernacular in momentsof deepest sincerity could thus come back i ll believe it hepresently added when amerigo complains of you ah it s just he who s my selfishness i m selfish so to speak for him i mean she continued that he s my motive ineverything well her father could from experience fancy what she meant but hasn t a girl a right to be selfish about her husband what i don t mean she observed without answering is that i mjealous of him but that s his merit it s not mine her father again seemed amused at her you could be otherwise oh how can i talk she asked of otherwise it isn t luckilyfor me otherwise if everything were different she furtherpresented her thought of course everything would be and thenagain as if that were but half my idea is this that when youonly love a little you re naturally not jealous or are onlyjealous also a little so that it doesn t matter but when youlove in a deeper and intenser way then you are in the sameproportion jealous your jealousy has intensity and no doubt ferocity when however you love in the most abysmal andunutterable way of all why then you re beyond everything andnothing can pull you down mr verver listened as if he had nothing on these high lines tooppose and that s the way you love for a minute she failed to speak but at last she answered itwasn t to talk about that i do feel however beyond everything and as a consequence of that i dare say she added with aturn to gaiety seem often not to know quite where i am the mere fine pulse of passion in it the suggestion as of acreature consciously floating and shining in a warm summer sea some element of dazzling sapphire and silver a creature cradledupon depths buoyant among dangers in which fear or folly orsinking otherwise than in play was impossible something of allthis might have been making once more present to him with hisdiscreet his half shy assent to it her probable enjoyment of arapture that he in his day had presumably convinced no greatnumber of persons either of his giving or of his receiving hesat awhile as if he knew himself hushed almost admonished andnot for the first time yet it was an effect that might havebrought before him rather what she had gained than what he hadmissed besides who but himself really knew what he after all hadn t or even had gained the beauty of her condition was keeping him at any rate as he might feel in sight of the sea where thoughhis personal dips were over the whole thing could shine at him and the air and the plash and the play become for him too asensation that couldn t be fixed upon him as missing since ifit wasn t personally floating if it wasn t even sitting in thesand it could yet pass very well for breathing the bliss in acommunicated irresistible way for tasting the balm it couldpass further for knowing for knowing that without him nothingmight have been which would have been missing least of all i guess i ve never been jealous he finally remarked and itsaid more to her he had occasion next to perceive than he wasintending for it made her as by the pressure of a spring givehim a look that seemed to tell of things she couldn t speak but she at last tried for one of them oh it s you father whoare what i call beyond everything nothing can pull you down he returned the look as with the sociability of their easycommunion though inevitably throwing in this time a shade ofsolemnity he might have been seeing things to say and others whether of a type presumptuous or not doubtless better keptback so he settled on the merely obvious well then we make apair we re all right oh we re all right a declaration launched not only with allher discriminating emphasis but confirmed by her rising withdecision and standing there as if the object of their smallexcursion required accordingly no further pursuit at thisjuncture however with the act of their crossing the bar toget as might be into port there occurred the only approach toa betrayal of their having had to beat against the wind herfather kept his place and it was as if she had got over firstand were pausing for her consort to follow if they were allright they were all right yet he seemed to hesitate and waitfor some word beyond his eyes met her own suggestively and itwas only after she had contented herself with simply smiling athim smiling ever so fixedly that he spoke for the remainingimportance of it from the bench where he leaned back raisinghis face to her his legs thrust out a trifle wearily and hishands grasping either side of the seat they had beaten againstthe wind and she was still fresh they had beaten against thewind and he as at the best the more battered vessel perhapsjust vaguely drooped but the effect of their silence was thatshe appeared to beckon him on and he might have been fairlyalongside of her when at the end of another minute he foundtheir word the only thing is that as for ever putting up againwith your pretending that you re selfish at this she helped him out with it you won t take it from me i won t take it from you well of course you won t for that s your way it doesn tmatter and it only proves but it doesn t matter either whatit proves i m at this very moment she declared frozen stiffwith selfishness he faced her awhile longer in the same way it was strangely asif by this sudden arrest by their having in their acceptanceof the unsaid or at least their reference to it practicallygiven up pretending it was as if they were in for it forsomething they had been ineffably avoiding but the dread ofwhich was itself in a manner a seduction just as anyconfession of the dread was by so much an allusion then sheseemed to see him let himself go when a person s of the natureyou speak of there are always other persons to suffer but you vejust been describing to me what you d take if you had once agood chance from your husband oh i m not talking about my husband then whom are you talking about both the retort and the rejoinder had come quicker than anythingpreviously exchanged and they were followed on maggie s part by a momentary drop but she was not to fall away and while hercompanion kept his eyes on her while she wondered if he weren texpecting her to name his wife then with high hypocrisy aspaying for his daughter s bliss she produced something that shefelt to be much better i m talking about you do you mean i ve been your victim of course you ve been my victim what have you done ever done that hasn t been for me many things more than i can tell you things you ve only tothink of for yourself what do you make of all that i ve done formyself yourself she brightened out with derision what do you make of what i ve done for american city it took her but a moment to say i m not talking of you as apublic character i m talking of you on your personal side well american city if personalities can do it has given mea pretty personal side what do you make he went on of whati ve done for my reputation your reputation there you ve given it up to them the awfulpeople for less than nothing you ve given it up to them to tearto pieces to make their horrible vulgar jokes against you with ah my dear i don t care for their horrible vulgar jokes adamverver almost artlessly urged then there exactly you are she triumphed everything thattouches you everything that surrounds you goes on by yoursplendid indifference and your incredible permission at yourexpense just as he had been sitting he looked at her an instant longer then he slowly rose while his hands stole into his pockets andstood there before her of course my dear you go on at myexpense it has never been my idea he smiled that you shouldwork for your living i wouldn t have liked to see it withwhich for a little again they remained face to face saytherefore i have had the feelings of a father how have they mademe a victim because i sacrifice you but to what in the world at this it hung before her that she should have had as never yether opportunity to say and it held her for a minute as in avise her impression of his now with his strained smile whichtouched her to deepest depths sounding her in his secret unrest this was the moment in the whole process of their mutualvigilance in which it decidedly most hung by a hair that theirthin wall might be pierced by the lightest wrong touch it shookbetween them this transparency with their very breath it wasan exquisite tissue but stretched on a frame and would give waythe next instant if either so much as breathed too hard she heldher breath for she knew by his eyes the light at the heart ofwhich he couldn t blind that he was by his intention makingsure sure whether or no her certainty was like his theintensity of his dependence on it at that moment this itself waswhat absolutely convinced her so that as if perched up beforehim on her vertiginous point and in the very glare of hisobservation she balanced for thirty seconds she almost rocked she might have been for the time in all her conscious person the very form of the equilibrium they were in their differentways equally trying to save and they were saving it yes theywere or at least she was that was still the workable issue shecould say as she felt her dizziness drop she held herself hard the thing was to be done once for all by her acting now whereshe stood so much was crowded into so short a space that sheknew already she was keeping her head she had kept it by thewarning of his eyes she shouldn t lose it again she knew howand why and if she had turned cold this was precisely whathelped her he had said to himself she ll break down and nameamerigo she ll say it s to him she s sacrificing me and its bywhat that will give me with so many other things too that mysuspicion will be clinched he was watching her lips spying forthe symptoms of the sound whereby these symptoms had only tofail and he would have got nothing that she didn t measure out tohim as she gave it she had presently in fact so recoveredherself that she seemed to know she could more easily have madehim name his wife than he have made her name her husband it wasthere before her that if she should so much as force him just notconsciously to avoid saying charlotte charlotte he would havegiven himself away but to be sure of this was enough for her and she saw more clearly with each lapsing instant what they wereboth doing he was doing what he had steadily been coming to hewas practically offering himself pressing himself upon her as asacrifice he had read his way so into her best possibility andwhere had she already for weeks and days past planted her feetif not on her acceptance of the offer cold indeed colder andcolder she turned as she felt herself suffer this close personalvision of his attitude still not to make her weaken that was hervery certitude the intensity of his pressure for if somethingdreadful hadn t happened there wouldn t for either of them bethese dreadful things to do she had meanwhile as well theimmense advantage that she could have named charlotte withoutexposing herself as for that matter she was the next minuteshowing him why i sacrifice you simply to everything and to every one itake the consequences of your marriage as perfectly natural he threw back his head a little settling with one hand hiseyeglass what do you call my dear the consequences your life as your marriage has made it well hasn t it made it exactly what we wanted she justhesitated then felt herself steady oh beyond what she haddreamed exactly what i wanted yes his eyes through his straightened glasses were still on hers and he might with his intenser fixed smile have been knowingshe was for herself rightly inspired what do you make then ofwhat i wanted i don t make anything any more than of what you ve got that sexactly the point i don t put myself out to do so i never have i take from you all i can get all you ve provided for me and ileave you to make of your own side of the matter what you can there you are the rest is your own affair i don t even pretendto concern myself to concern yourself he watched her as she faintly faltered looking about her now so as not to keep always meeting his face with what may have really become of you it s as if we hadagreed from the first not to go into that such an arrangementbeing of course charming for me you can t say you know that ihaven t stuck to it he didn t say so then even with the opportunity given him of herstopping once more to catch her breath he said instead oh mydear oh oh but it made no difference know as she might what a past stillso recent and yet so distant it alluded to she repeated herdenial warning him off on her side from spoiling the truth ofher contention i never went into anything and you see i don t i ve continued to adore you but what s that from a decentdaughter to such a father what but a question of convenientarrangement our having two houses three houses instead of one you would have arranged for fifty if i had wished and mymaking it easy for you to see the child you don t claim isuppose that my natural course once you had set up foryourself would have been to ship you back to american city these were direct inquiries they quite rang out in the soft wooded air so that adam verver for a minute appeared to meetthem with reflection she saw reflection however quickly enoughshow him what to do with them do you know mag what you makeme wish when you talk that way and he waited again while shefurther got from him the sense of something that had been behind deeply in the shade coming cautiously to the front and justfeeling its way before presenting itself you regularly make mewish that i had shipped back to american city when you go on asyou do but he really had to hold himself to say it well when i go on why you make me quite want to ship back myself you make mequite feel as if american city would be the best place for us it made her all too finely vibrate for us for me and charlotte do you know that if we should ship itwould serve you quite right with which he smiled oh he smiled and if you say much more we will ship ah then it was that the cup of her conviction full to the brim overflowed at a touch there was his idea the clearness of whichfor an instant almost dazzled her it was a blur of light in themidst of which she saw charlotte like some object marked bycontrast in blackness saw her waver in the field of vision sawher removed transported doomed and he had named charlotte named her again and she had made him which was all she hadneeded more it was as if she had held a blank letter to the fireand the writing had come out still larger than she hoped therecognition of it took her some seconds but she might when shespoke have been folding up these precious lines and restoringthem to her pocket well i shall be as much as ever then thecause of what you do i haven t the least doubt of your being upto that if you should think i might get anything out of it eventhe little pleasure she laughed of having said as you callit more let my enjoyment of this therefore at any price continue to represent for you what i call sacrificing you she had drawn a long breath she had made him do it all for her and had lighted the way to it without his naming her husband that silence had been as distinct as the sharp the inevitablesound and something now in him followed it up a sudden air asof confessing at last fully to where she was and of begging theparticular question don t you think then i can take care ofmyself ah it s exactly what i ve gone upon if it wasn t for that but she broke off and they remained only another moment face toface i ll let you know my dear the day i feel you ve begunto sacrifice me begun she extravagantly echoed well it will be for me the day you ve ceased to believe inme with which his glasses still fixed on her his hands in hispockets his hat pushed back his legs a little apart he seemedto plant or to square himself for a kind of assurance it hadoccurred to him he might as well treat her to in default ofother things before they changed their subject it had theeffect for her of a reminder a reminder of all he was of allhe had done of all above and beyond his being her perfectlittle father she might take him as representing take him ashaving quite eminently in the eyes of two hemispheres beencapable of and as therefore wishing not was it illegitimately to call her attention to the successful beneficent person the beautiful bountiful original dauntlessly wilful great citizen the consummate collector andinfallible high authority he had been and still was these thingsstruck her on the spot as making up for him in a wonderfulway a character she must take into account in dealing with himeither for pity or for envy he positively under the impression seemed to loom larger than life for her so that she saw himduring these moments in a light of recognition which had had itsbrightness for her at many an hour of the past but which hadnever been so intense and so almost admonitory his veryquietness was part of it now as always part of everything ofhis success his originality his modesty his exquisite publicperversity his inscrutable incalculable energy and thisquality perhaps it might be all the more too as the result forthe present occasion of an admirable traceable effort thatplaced him in her eyes as no precious a work of art probably hadever been placed in his own there was a long moment absolutely during which her impression rose and rose even as that of thetypical charmed gazer in the still museum before the named anddated object the pride of the catalogue that time has polishedand consecrated extraordinary in particular was the number ofthe different ways in which he thus affected her as showing hewas strong that was the great thing he was sure sure forhimself always whatever his idea the expression of that in himhad somehow never appeared more identical with his proved tastefor the rare and the true but what stood out beyond everythingwas that he was always marvellously young which couldn t butcrown at this juncture his whole appeal to her imagination before she knew it she was lifted aloft by the consciousness thathe was simply a great and deep and high little man and that tolove him with tenderness was not to be distinguished a whit from loving him with pride it came to her all strangely as asudden an immense relief the sense that he wasn t a failure and could never be purged their predicament of every meanness made it as if they had really emerged in their transmuted union to smile almost without pain it was like a new confidence andafter another instant she knew even still better why wasn t itbecause now also on his side he was thinking of her as hisdaughter was trying her during these mute seconds as the childof his blood oh then if she wasn t with her little consciouspassion the child of any weakness what was she but strongenough too it swelled in her fairly it raised her higher higher she wasn t in that case a failure either hadn t been but the contrary his strength was her strength her pride washis and they were decent and competent together this was all inthe answer she finally made him i believe in you more than any one than any one at all she hesitated for all it might mean but there was oh athousand times no doubt of it than any one at all she keptnothing of it back now met his eyes over it let him have thewhole of it after which she went on and that s the way ithink you believe in me he looked at her a minute longer but his tone at last was right about the way yes well then she spoke as for the end and for other matters for anything everything else there might be they would neverreturn to it well then his hands came out and while her own took them hedrew her to his breast and held her he held her hard and kepther long and she let herself go but it was an embrace that august and almost stern produced for all its intimacy norevulsion and broke into no inconsequence of tears xxxviiimaggie was to feel after this passage how they had both beenhelped through it by the influence of that accident of her havingbeen caught a few nights before in the familiar embrace of herfather s wife his return to the saloon had chanced to coincideexactly with this demonstration missed moreover neither by herhusband nor by the assinghams who their card party suspended had quitted the billiard room with him she had been consciousenough at the time of what such an impression received by theothers might in that extended state do for her case and nonethe less that as no one had appeared to wish to be the first tomake a remark about it it had taken on perceptibly the specialshade of consecration conferred by unanimities of silence theeffect she might have considered had been almost awkward thepromptitude of her separation from charlotte as if they had beendiscovered in some absurdity on her becoming aware ofspectators the spectators on the other hand that was theappearance mightn t have supposed them in the existingrelation addicted to mutual endearments and yet hesitatingwith a fine scruple between sympathy and hilarity must have feltthat almost any spoken or laughed comment could be kept fromsounding vulgar only by sounding beyond any permitted measure intelligent they had evidently looked the two young wives likea pair of women making up effusively as women were supposed todo especially when approved fools after a broil but takingnote of the reconciliation would imply on her father s part onamerigo s and on fanny assingham s some proportionate vision ofthe grounds of their difference there had been something therehad been but too much in the incident for each observer yetthere was nothing any one could have said without seemingessentially to say see see the dear things their quarrel sblissfully over our quarrel what quarrel the dear thingsthemselves would necessarily in that case have demanded andthe wits of the others would thus have been called upon for someagility of exercise no one had been equal to the flight ofproducing off hand a fictive reason for any estrangement totake that is the place of the true which had so long for thefiner sensibility pervaded the air and every one accordingly not to be inconveniently challenged was pretending immediatelyafter to have remarked nothing that any one else hadn t maggie s own measure had remained all the same full of thereflection caught from the total inference which had acted virtually by enabling every one present and oh charlotte notleast to draw a long breath the message of the little scenehad been different for each but it had been this markedly allround that it reinforced reinforced even immensely the generaleffort carried on from week to week and of late distinctly moresuccessful to look and talk and move as if nothing in life werethe matter supremely however while this glass was held up toher had maggie s sense turned to the quality of the successconstituted on the spot for charlotte most of all if she wasguessing how her father must have secretly started how herhusband must have secretly wondered how fanny assingham musthave secretly in a flash seen daylight for herself most of allhad she tasted by communication of the high profit involved forher companion she felt in all her pulses charlotte feel it and how publicity had been required absolutely to crown her ownabasement it was the added touch and now nothing was wanting which to do her stepmother justice mrs verver had appeared butto desire from that evening to show with the last vividness that she recognised maggie lived over again the minutes inquestion had found herself repeatedly doing so to the degreethat the whole evening hung together to her aftersense as athing appointed by some occult power that had dealt with her that had for instance animated the four with just the rightrestlessness too had decreed and directed and exactly timed itin them making their game of bridge however abysmal a face ithad worn for her give way precisely to their common unavowedimpulse to find out to emulate charlotte s impatience apreoccupation this latter attached detectedly to the member ofthe party who was roaming in her queerness and was for all theirsimulated blindness not roaming unnoted if mrs verver meanwhile then had struck her as determined in acertain direction by the last felicity into which that night hadflowered our young woman was yet not to fail of appreciating thetruth that she had not been put at ease after all with absolutepermanence maggie had seen her unmistakably desire to rise tothe occasion and be magnificent seen her decide that the rightway for this would be to prove that the reassurance she hadextorted there under the high cool lustre of the saloon atwinkle of crystal and silver had not only poured oil upon thetroubled waters of their question but had fairly drenched theirwhole intercourse with that lubricant she had exceeded the limitof discretion in this insistence on her capacity to repay inproportion a service she acknowledged as handsome whyhandsome maggie would have been free to ask since if she hadbeen veracious the service assuredly would not have been huge itwould in that case have come up vividly and for each of themalike that the truth on the princess s lips presented nodifficulty if the latter s mood in fact could have turneditself at all to private gaiety it might have failed to resistthe diversion of seeing so clever a creature so beguiled charlotte s theory of a generous manner was manifestly to expressthat her stepdaughter s word wiping out as she might have said everything had restored them to the serenity of a relationwithout a cloud it had been in short in this light ideallyconclusive so that no ghost of anything it referred to couldever walk again what was the ecstasy of that however but initself a trifle compromising as truly within the week maggiehad occasion to suspect her friend of beginning and ratherabruptly to remember convinced as she was of the examplealready given her by her husband and in relation to which herprofession of trust in his mistress had been an act of conformityexquisitely calculated her imagination yet sought in the hiddenplay of his influence the explanation of any change of surface any difference of expression or intention there had been through life as we know few quarters in which the princess sfancy could let itself loose but it shook off restraint when itplunged into the figured void of the detail of that relation this was a realm it could people with images again and againwith fresh ones they swarmed there like the strange combinationsthat lurked in the woods at twilight they loomed into thedefinite and faded into the vague their main present sign forher being however that they were always that they wereduskily agitated her earlier vision of a state of bliss madeinsecure by the very intensity of the bliss this had droppedfrom her she had ceased to see as she lost herself the pair ofoperatic of high wagnerian lovers she found deep within her these comparisons interlocked in their wood of enchantment agreen glade as romantic as one s dream of an old german forest the picture was veiled on the contrary with the dimness oftrouble behind which she felt indistinguishable the processionof forms that had lost all so pitifully their preciousconfidence therefore though there was in these days for her with amerigo little enough even of the imitation from day today of unembarrassed references as she had foreseen for thatmatter from the first that there would be her activeconception of his accessibility to their companion s own privateand unextinguished right to break ground was not much less activethan before so it was that her inner sense in spite ofeverything represented him as still pulling wires andcontrolling currents or rather indeed as muffling the wholepossibility keeping it down and down leading his accomplicecontinually on to some new turn of the road as regards herselfmaggie had become more conscious from week to week of hisingenuities of intention to make up to her for their forfeiture in so dire a degree of any reality of frankness a privationthat had left on his lips perhaps a little of the same thirstwith which she fairly felt her own distorted the torment of thelost pilgrim who listens in desert sands for the possible theimpossible plash of water it was just this hampered state inhim none the less that she kept before her when she wished mostto find grounds of dignity for the hard little passion whichnothing he had done could smother there were hours enough lonely hours in which she let dignity go then there were otherswhen clinging with her winged concentration to some deep cell ofher heart she stored away her hived tenderness as if she hadgathered it all from flowers he was walking ostensibly besideher but in fact given over without a break to the grey mediumin which he helplessly groped a perception on her part which wasa perpetual pang and which might last what it would for ever ifneed be but which if relieved at all must be relieved by hisact alone she herself could do nothing more for it she had donethe utmost possible it was meantime not the easier to bear forthis aspect under which charlotte was presented as depending onhim for guidance taking it from him even in doses of bitterness and yet lost with him in devious depths nothing was thus moresharply to be inferred than that he had promptly enough warnedher on hearing from her of the precious assurance received fromhis wife that she must take care her satisfaction didn t betraysomething of her danger maggie had a day of still waiting afterallowing him time to learn how unreservedly she had lied forhim of waiting as for the light of she scarce knew what slow shining reflection of this knowledge in his personal attitude what retarded evolution she asked herself in these hours mightn t poor charlotte all unwittingly have precipitated shewas thus poor charlotte again for maggie even while maggie s ownhead was bowed and the reason for this kept coming back to ouryoung woman in the conception of what would secretly have passed she saw her face to face with the prince take from him thechill of his stiffest admonition with the possibilities ofdeeper difficulty that it represented for each she heard herask irritated and sombre what tone in god s name since herbravery didn t suit him she was then to adopt and by way of afantastic flight of divination she heard amerigo reply in avoice of which every fine note familiar and admirable came hometo her that one must really manage such prudences a little forone s self it was positive in the princess that for this shebreathed charlotte s cold air turned away from him in it withher turned with her in growing compassion this way and that hovered behind her while she felt her ask herself where then sheshould rest marvellous the manner in which under suchimaginations maggie thus circled and lingered quite as if shewere materially following her unseen counting every step shehelplessly wasted noting every hindrance that brought her to apause a few days of this accordingly had wrought a change in thatapprehension of the instant beatitude of triumph of triumphmagnanimous and serene with which the upshot of the night sceneon the terrace had condemned our young woman to make terms shehad had as we know her vision of the gilt bars bent of thedoor of the cage forced open from within and the creatureimprisoned roaming at large a movement on the creature s part that was to have even for the short interval its impressivebeauty but of which the limit and in yet another direction hadloomed straight into view during her last talk under the greattrees with her father it was when she saw his wife s faceruefully attached to the quarter to which in the course of theirsession he had so significantly addressed his own it was thenthat maggie could watch for its turning pale it was then sheseemed to know what she had meant by thinking of her in sheshadow of his most ominous reference as doomed if as i say her attention now day after day so circled and hovered itfound itself arrested for certain passages during which sheabsolutely looked with charlotte s grave eyes what sheunfailingly made out through them was the figure of a littlequiet gentleman who mostly wore as he moved alone across thefield of vision a straw hat a white waistcoat and a bluenecktie keeping a cigar in his teeth and his hands in hispockets and who oftener than not presented a somewhatmeditative back while he slowly measured the perspectives of thepark and broodingly counted it might have appeared his steps there were hours of intensity for a week or two when it was forall the world as if she had guardedly tracked her stepmother inthe great house from room to room and from window to window only to see her here and there and everywhere try her uneasyoutlook question her issue and her fate something unmistakably had come up for her that had never come up before it represented a new complication and had begotten a newanxiety things these that she carried about with her done upin the napkin of her lover s accepted rebuke while she vainlyhunted for some corner where she might put them safely down thedisguised solemnity the prolonged futility of her search mighthave been grotesque to a more ironic eye but maggie s provisionof irony which we have taken for naturally small had never beenso scant as now and there were moments while she watched withher thus unseen when the mere effect of being near her was tofeel her own heart in her throat was to be almost moved tosaying to her hold on tight my poor dear without too muchterror and it will all come out somehow even to that indeed she could reflect charlotte might havereplied that it was easy to say even to that no great meaningcould attach so long as the little meditative man in the strawhat kept coming into view with his indescribable air of weavinghis spell weaving it off there by himself in whatever quarterof the horizon the appearances were scanned he was to be noticedas absorbed in this occupation and maggie was to become aware oftwo or three extraordinary occasions of receiving from him thehint that he measured the impression he produced it was notreally till after their recent long talk in the park that sheknew how deeply how quite exhaustively they had thencommunicated so that they were to remain together for the time in consequence quite in the form of a couple of sociabledrinkers who sit back from the table over which they have beenresting their elbows over which they have emptied to the lastdrop their respective charged cups the cups were still there onthe table but turned upside down and nothing was left for thecompanions but to confirm by placid silences the fact that thewine had been good they had parted positively as if on eitherside primed with it primed for whatever was to be andeverything between them as the month waned added its touch oftruth to this similitude nothing truly was at present betweenthem save that they were looking at each other in infinite trust it fairly wanted no more words and when they met during thedeep summer days met even without witnesses when they kissed atmorning and evening or on any of the other occasions of contactthat they had always so freely celebrated a pair of birds of theupper air could scarce have appeared less to invite each other tosit down and worry afresh so it was that in the house itself where more of his waiting treasures than ever were provisionallyranged she sometimes only looked at him from end to end of thegreat gallery the pride of the house for instance as if inone of the halls of a museum she had been an earnest young woman with a baedeker and he a vague gentleman to whom even baedekerswere unknown he had ever of course had his way of walkingabout to review his possessions and verify their condition butthis was a pastime to which he now struck her as almostextravagantly addicted and when she passed near him and heturned to give her a smile she caught or so she fancied thegreater depth of his small perpetual hum of contemplation itwas as if he were singing to himself sotto voce as he went andit was also on occasion quite ineffably as if charlotte hovering watching listening on her side too kept sufficientlywithin earshot to make it out as song and yet for some reasonconnected with the very manner of it stood off and didn t dare one of the attentions she had from immediately after her marriagemost freely paid him was that of her interest in his rarities her appreciation of his taste her native passion for beautifulobjects and her grateful desire not to miss anything he couldteach her about them maggie had in due course seen her beginto work this fortunately natural source of sympathy for all itwas worth she took possession of the mound throughout itsextent she abounded to odd excess one might have remarked inthe assumption of its being for her with her husband all theground the finest clearest air and most breathable mediumcommon to them it had been given to maggie to wonder if shedidn t in these intensities of approbation too much shut him upto his province but this was a complaint he had never made hisdaughter and charlotte must at least have had for her that thanks to her admirable instinct her range of perceptionmarching with his own and never falling behind she had probablynot so much as once treated him to a rasping mistake or arevealing stupidity maggie wonderfully in the summer days felt it forced upon her that that was one way after all ofbeing a genial wife and it was never so much forced upon her asat these odd moments of her encountering the sposi as amerigocalled them under the coved ceilings of fawns while sotogether yet at the same time so separate they were makingtheir daily round charlotte hung behind with emphasisedattention she stopped when her husband stopped but at thedistance of a case or two or of whatever other succession ofobjects and the likeness of their connection would not have beenwrongly figured if he had been thought of as holding in one ofhis pocketed hands the end of a long silken halter looped roundher beautiful neck he didn t twitch it yet it was there hedidn t drag her but she came and those indications that i havedescribed the princess as finding extraordinary in him were twoor three mute facial intimations which his wife s presence didn tprevent his addressing his daughter nor prevent his daughter asshe passed it was doubtless to be added from flushing a littleat the receipt of they amounted perhaps only to a wordless wordless smile but the smile was the soft shake of the twistedsilken rope and maggie s translation of it held in her breasttill she got well away came out only as if it might have beenoverheard when some door was closed behind her yes you see ilead her now by the neck i lead her to her doom and she doesn tso much as know what it is though she has a fear in her heartwhich if you had the chances to apply your ear there that i asa husband have you would hear thump and thump and thump shethinks it may be her doom the awful place over there awful forher but she s afraid to ask don t you see just as she s afraidof not asking just as she s afraid of so many other things thatshe sees multiplied round her now as portents and betrayals she ll know however when she does know charlotte s one opportunity meanwhile for the air of confidenceshe had formerly worn so well and that agreed so with her firmand charming type was the presence of visitors never as theseason advanced wholly intermitted rather in fact soconstant with all the people who turned up for luncheon and fortea and to see the house now replete now famous thatmaggie grew to think again of this large element of company asof a kind of renewed water supply for the tank in which like aparty of panting gold fish they kept afloat it helped them unmistakably with each other weakening the emphasis of so manyof the silences of which their intimate intercourse wouldotherwise have consisted beautiful and wonderful for her even at times was the effect of these interventions their effectabove all in bringing home to each the possible heroism ofperfunctory things they learned fairly to live in theperfunctory they remained in it as many hours of the day asmight be it took on finally the likeness of some spaciouscentral chamber in a haunted house a great overarched andoverglazed rotunda where gaiety might reign but the doors ofwhich opened into sinister circular passages here they turned upfor each other as they said with the blank faces that deniedany uneasiness felt in the approach here they closed numerousdoors carefully behind them all save the door that connected theplace as by a straight tented corridor with the outer world and encouraging thus the irruption of society imitated theaperture through which the bedizened performers of the circus arepoured into the ring the great part mrs verver had sociallyplayed came luckily maggie could make out to her assistance she had personal friends charlotte s personal friends had everbeen in london at the two houses one of the most convenientpleasantries who actually tempered at this crisis her aspectof isolation and it wouldn t have been hard to guess that herbest moments were those in which she suffered no fear of becominga bore to restrain her appeal to their curiosity their curiositymight be vague but their clever hostess was distinct and shemarched them about sparing them nothing as if she counted eachday on a harvest of half crowns maggie met her again in thegallery at the oddest hours with the party she wasentertaining heard her draw out the lesson insist upon theinterest snub even the particular presumption and smile forthe general bewilderment inevitable features these latter ofalmost any occasion in a manner that made our young woman herself incurably dazzled marvel afresh at the mystery by whicha creature who could be in some connexions so earnestly rightcould be in others so perversely wrong when her father vaguelycirculating was attended by his wife it was always charlottewho seemed to bring up the rear but he hung in the backgroundwhen she did cicerone and it was then perhaps that movingmildly and modestly to and fro on the skirts of the exhibition his appearance of weaving his spell was for the initiatedconscience least to be resisted brilliant women turned to himin vague emotion but his response scarce committed him more thanif he had been the person employed to see that after theinvading wave was spent the cabinets were all locked and thesymmetries all restored there was a morning when during the hour before luncheon andshortly after the arrival of a neighbourly contingent neighbourly from ten miles off whom mrs verver had taken incharge maggie paused on the threshold of the gallery throughwhich she had been about to pass faltered there for the veryimpression of his face as it met her from an opposite door charlotte half way down the vista held together as if bysomething almost austere in the grace of her authority thesemi scared now that they were there knot of her visitors who since they had announced themselves by telegram as yearningto inquire and admire saw themselves restricted to thisconsistency her voice high and clear and a little hard reachedher husband and her step daughter while she thus placed beyonddoubt her cheerful submission to duty her words addressed tothe largest publicity rang for some minutes through the place every one as quiet to listen as if it had been a church ablazewith tapers and she were taking her part in some hymn of praise fanny assingham looked rapt in devotion fanny assingham whoforsook this other friend as little as she forsook either herhost or the princess or the prince or the principino shesupported her in slow revolutions in murmurous attestations ofpresence at all such times and maggie advancing after a firsthesitation was not to fail of noting her solemn inscrutableattitude her eyes attentively lifted so that she might escapebeing provoked to betray an impression she betrayed one however as maggie approached dropping her gaze to the latter slevel long enough to seem to adventure marvellously on a muteappeal you understand don t you that if she didn t do thisthere would be no knowing what she might do this light mrs assingham richly launched while her younger friend unresistinglymoved became uncertain again and then not too much to showit or rather positively to conceal it and to concealsomething more as well turned short round to one of the windowsand awkwardly pointlessly waited the largest of the threepieces has the rare peculiarity that the garlands looped roundit which as you see are the finest possible vieux saxe arenot of the same origin or period or even wonderful as they are of a taste quite so perfect they have been put on at a latertime by a process of which there are very few examples and noneso important as this which is really quite unique so that though the whole thing is a little baroque its value as aspecimen is i believe almost inestimable so the high voice quavered aiming truly at effects far over theheads of gaping neighbours so the speaker piling it up sticking at nothing as less interested judges might have said seemed to justify the faith with which she was honoured maggiemeanwhile at the window knew the strangest thing to behappening she had turned suddenly to crying or was at least onthe point of it the lighted square before her all blurred anddim the high voice went on its quaver was doubtless forconscious ears only but there were verily thirty seconds duringwhich it sounded for our young woman like the shriek of a soulin pain kept up a minute longer it would break and collapse sothat maggie felt herself the next thing turn with a start toher father can t she be stopped hasn t she done it enough some such question as that she let herself ask him to suppose inher then it was that across half the gallery for he had notmoved from where she had first seen him he struck her asconfessing with strange tears in his own eyes to sharp identityof emotion poor thing poor thing it reached straight isn t she for one s credit on the swagger after which as held thus together they had still another strained minute theshame the pity the better knowledge the smothered protest thedivined anguish even so overcame him that blushing to his eyes he turned short away the affair but of a few muffled moments this snatched communion yet lifted maggie as on air so much fordeep guesses on her own side too it gave her to think of therewas honestly an awful mixture in things and it was not closedto her aftersense of such passages we have already indeed inother cases seen it open that the deepest depth of all in aperceived penalty was that you couldn t be sure some of yourcompunctions and contortions wouldn t show for ridiculous amerigo that morning for instance had been as absent as he atthis juncture appeared to desire he should mainly be noted asbeing he had gone to london for the day and the night anecessity that now frequently rose for him and that he had morethan once suffered to operate during the presence of guests successions of pretty women the theory of his fond interest inwhom had been publicly cultivated it had never occurred to hiswife to pronounce him ingenuous but there came at last a highdim august dawn when she couldn t sleep and when creepingrestlessly about and breathing at her window the coolness ofwooded acres she found the faint flush of the east march withthe perception of that other almost equal prodigy it rosilycoloured her vision that even such as he was yes her husbandcould on occasion sin by excess of candour he wouldn t otherwisehave given as his reason for going up to portland place in theaugust days that he was arranging books there he had bought agreat many of late and he had had others a large number sentfrom rome wonders of old print in which her father had beeninterested but when her imagination tracked him to the dustytown to the house where drawn blinds and pale shrouds where acaretaker and a kitchenmaid were alone in possession it wasn tto see him in his shirtsleeves unpacking battered boxes she saw him in truth less easily beguiled saw him wander inthe closed dusky rooms from place to place or else for longperiods recline on deep sofas and stare before him through thesmoke of ceaseless cigarettes she made him out as liking betterthan anything in the world just now to be alone with histhoughts being herself connected with his thoughts shecontinued to believe more than she had ever been it was therebya good deal as if he were alone with her she made him out asresting so from that constant strain of the perfunctory to whichhe was exposed at fawns and she was accessible to the impressionof the almost beggared aspect of this alternative it was likehis doing penance in sordid ways being sent to prison or beingkept without money it wouldn t have taken much to make her thinkof him as really kept without food he might have broken away might easily have started to travel he had a right thoughtwonderful maggie now to so many more freedoms than he took hissecret was of course that at fawns he all the while winced wasall the while in presences in respect to which he had thrownhimself back with a hard pressure on whatever mysteries ofpride whatever inward springs familiar to the man of the world he could keep from snapping maggie for some reason had thatmorning while she watched the sunrise taken an extraordinarymeasure of the ground on which he would have had to snatch atpretexts for absence it all came to her there he got off toescape from a sound the sound was in her own ears still that ofcharlotte s high coerced quaver before the cabinets in the hushedgallery the voice by which she herself had been pierced the daybefore as by that of a creature in anguish and by which whileshe sought refuge at the blurred window the tears had beenforced into her eyes her comprehension soared so high that thewonder for her became really his not feeling the need of widerintervals and thicker walls before that admiration she alsomeditated consider as she might now she kept reading not lessinto what he omitted than into what he performed a beauty ofintention that touched her fairly the more by being obscure itwas like hanging over a garden in the dark nothing was to bemade of the confusion of growing things but one felt they werefolded flowers and their vague sweetness made the whole airtheir medium he had to turn away but he wasn t at least acoward he would wait on the spot for the issue of what he haddone on the spot she sank to her knees with her arm on the ledgeof her window seat where she blinded her eyes from the fullglare of seeing that his idea could only be to wait whatevermight come at her side it was to her buried face that she thus for a long time felt him draw nearest though after a while when the strange wail of the gallery began to repeat itsinevitable echo she was conscious of how that brought out hispale hard grimace xxxixthe resemblance had not been present to her on first coming outinto the hot still brightness of the sunday afternoon only thesecond sunday of all the summer when the party of six theparty of seven including the principino had practically beenwithout accessions or invasions but within sight of charlotte seated far away very much where she had expected to find her the princess fell to wondering if her friend wouldn t be affectedquite as she herself had been that night on the terrace undermrs verver s perceptive pursuit the relation to day hadturned itself round charlotte was seeing her come throughpatches of lingering noon quite as she had watched charlottemenace her through the starless dark and there was a moment that of her waiting a little as they thus met across thedistance when the interval was bridged by a recognition not lesssoundless and to all appearance not less charged with strangemeanings than that of the other occasion the point however was that they had changed places maggie had from her window seen her stepmother leave the house at so unlikely an hour three o clock of a canicular august for a ramble in garden orgrove and had thereupon felt her impulse determined with thesame sharpness that had made the spring of her companion s threeweeks before it was the hottest day of the season and theshaded siesta for people all at their ease would certainlyrather have been prescribed but our young woman had perhaps notyet felt it so fully brought home that such refinements ofrepose among them constituted the empty chair at the feast this was the more distinct as the feast literally in the greatbedimmed dining room the cool ceremonious semblance ofluncheon had just been taking place without mrs verver she hadbeen represented but by the plea of a bad headache not reportedto the rest of the company by her husband but offered directlyto mr verver himself on their having assembled by her maid deputed for the effect and solemnly producing it maggie had sat down with the others to viands artfully iced tothe slow circulation of precious tinkling jugs to markedreserves of reference in many directions poor fanny assinghamherself scarce thrusting her nose out of the padded hollow intowhich she had withdrawn a consensus of languor which mightalmost have been taken for a community of dread ruled thescene relieved only by the fitful experiments of fathermitchell good holy hungry man a trusted and overworked londonfriend and adviser who had taken for a week or two the lightneighbouring service local rites flourishing under maggie smunificence and was enjoying as a convenience all the bountiesof the house he conversed undiscouraged father mitchell conversed mainly with the indefinite wandering smile of theentertainers and the princess s power to feel him on the whole ablessing for these occasions was not impaired by what was awkwardin her consciousness of having from the first of her trouble really found her way without his guidance she asked herself attimes if he suspected how more than subtly how perversely shehad dispensed with him and she balanced between visions of allhe must privately have guessed and certitudes that he had guessednothing whatever he might nevertheless have been so urbanelyfilling up gaps at present for the very reason that hisinstinct sharper than the expression of his face hadsufficiently served him made him aware of the thin ice figuratively speaking and of prolongations of tension roundabout him mostly foreign to the circles in which luxury was akinto virtue some day in some happier season she would confess tohim that she hadn t confessed though taking so much on herconscience but just now she was carrying in her weak stiffenedhand a glass filled to the brim as to which she had recorded avow that no drop should overflow she feared the very breath of abetter wisdom the jostle of the higher light of heavenly helpitself and in addition however that might be she drew breaththis afternoon as never yet in an element heavy to oppression something grave had happened somehow and somewhere and she had god knew her choice of suppositions her heart stood still whenshe wondered above all if the cord mightn t at last have snappedbetween her husband and her father she shut her eyes for dismayat the possibility of such a passage there moved before them theprocession of ugly forms it might have taken find out foryourself she had thrown to amerigo for her last word on thequestion of who else knew that night of the breaking of thebowl and she flattered herself that she hadn t since then helpedhim in her clear consistency by an inch it was what she hadgiven him all these weeks to be busy with and she had againand again lain awake for the obsession of this sense of hisuncertainty ruthlessly and endlessly playing with his dignity she had handed him over to an ignorance that couldn t even try tobecome indifferent and that yet wouldn t project itself either into the cleared air of conviction in proportion as he wasgenerous it had bitten into his spirit and more than once shehad said to herself that to break the spell she had cast upon himand that the polished old ivory of her father s inattackablesurface made so absolute he would suddenly commit some mistakeor some violence smash some windowpane for air fail even of oneof his blest inveteracies of taste in that way fatally hewould have put himself in the wrong blighting by a single falsestep the perfection of his outward show these shadows rose and fell for her while father mitchellprattled with other shadows as well those that hung overcharlotte herself those that marked her as a prey to equalsuspicions to the idea in particular of a change such achange as she didn t dare to face in the relations of the twomen or there were yet other possibilities as it seemed tomaggie there were always too many and all of them things ofevil when one s nerves had at last done for one all that nervescould do had left one in a darkness of prowling dangers that waslike the predicament of the night watcher in a beast haunted landwho has no more means for a fire she might with such nerves have supposed almost anything of any one anything almost ofpoor bob assingham condemned to eternal observances and solemnlyappreciating her father s wine anything verily yes of thegood priest as he finally sat back with fat folded hands andtwiddled his thumbs on his stomach the good priest looked hardat the decanters at the different dishes of dessert he eyedthem half obliquely as if they might have met him to day forconversation better than any one present but the princess hadher fancy at last about that too she was in the midst of apassage before she knew it between father mitchell andcharlotte some approach he would have attempted with her thatvery morning perhaps to the circumstance of an apparentdetachment recently noted in her from any practice of devotion he would have drawn from this say his artless inference takenit for a sign of some smothered inward trouble and pointed naturally the moral that the way out of such straits was notthrough neglect of the grand remedy he had possibly prescribedcontrition he had at any rate quickened in her the beat of thatfalse repose to which our young woman s own act had devoted herat her all so deluded instance the falsity of it had laid trapscompared to which the imputation of treachery even accepted mighthave seemed a path of roses the acceptance strangely wouldhave left her nothing to do she could have remained had sheliked all insolently passive whereas the failure to proceedagainst her as it might have been called left her everything and all the more that it was wrapped so in confidence she had toconfirm day after day the rightness of her cause and thejustice and felicity of her exemption so that wouldn t therehave been fairly in any explicit concern of father mitchell s depths of practical derision of her success the question was provisionally answered at all events by thetime the party at luncheon had begun to disperse with maggie sversion of mrs verver sharp to the point of representing herpretext for absence as a positive flight from derision she metthe good priest s eyes before they separated and priests werereally at the worst so to speak such wonderful people that shebelieved him for an instant on the verge of saying to her inabysmal softness go to mrs verver my child you go you llfind that you can help her this didn t come however nothingcame but the renewed twiddle of thumbs over the satisfied stomachand the full flush the comical candour of reference to the handemployed at fawns for mayonnaise of salmon nothing came but thereceding backs of each of the others her father s slightly bentshoulders in especial which seemed to weave his spell by theforce of habit not less patiently than if his wife had beenpresent her husband indeed was present to feel anything theremight be to feel which was perhaps exactly why this personagewas moved promptly to emulate so definite an example of sloping he had his occupations books to arrange perhaps evenat fawns the idea of the siesta moreover in all theconditions had no need to be loudly invoked maggie was in theevent left alone for a minute with mrs assingham who afterwaiting for safety appeared to have at heart to make ademonstration the stage of talking over had long passed forthem when they communicated now it was on quite ultimate facts but fanny desired to testify to the existence on her part of anattention that nothing escaped she was like the kind lady who happening to linger at the circus while the rest of thespectators pour grossly through the exits falls in with theoverworked little trapezist girl the acrobatic supportpresumably of embarrassed and exacting parents and gives her asan obscure and meritorious artist assurance of benevolentinterest what was clearest always in our young woman simaginings was the sense of being herself left for anyoccasion in the breach she was essentially there to bear theburden in the last resort of surrounding omissions andevasions and it was eminently to that office she had been to dayabandoned with this one alleviation as appeared of mrs assingham s keeping up with her mrs assingham suggested thatshe too was still on the ramparts though her gallantry provedindeed after a moment to consist not a little of her curiosity she had looked about and seen their companions beyond earshot don t you really want us to go maggie found a faint smile do you really want to it made her friend colour well then no but we would youknow at a look from you we d pack up and be off as asacrifice ah make no sacrifice said maggie see me through that s it that s all i want i should be too base besides fanny went on you re too splendid splendid splendid also you know you are all but through you ve doneit said mrs assingham but maggie only half took it from her what does it strike you that i ve done what you wanted they re going maggie continued to look at her is that what i wanted oh it wasn t for you to say that was his business my father s maggie asked after an hesitation your father s he has chosen and now she knows she sees it allbefore her and she can t speak or resist or move a littlefinger that s what s the matter with her said fanny assingham it made a picture somehow for the princess as they stoodthere the picture that the words of others whatever they mightbe always made for her even when her vision was alreadycharged better than any words of her own she saw round abouther through the chinks of the shutters the hard glare ofnature saw charlotte somewhere in it virtually at bay and yetdenied the last grace of any protecting truth she saw her offsomewhere all unaided pale in her silence and taking in herfate has she told you she then asked her companion smiled superior i don t need to be told either i see something thank god every day and then asmaggie might appear to be wondering what for instance i seethe long miles of ocean and the dreadful great country stateafter state which have never seemed to me so big or so terrible i see them at last day by day and step by step at the far end and i see them never come back but never simply i see theextraordinary interesting place which i ve never been to youknow and you have and the exact degree in which she will beexpected to be interested she will be maggie presently replied expected interested for a little after this their eyes met on it at the end ofwhich fanny said she ll be yes what she ll have to be and itwill be won t it for ever and ever she spoke as abounding inher friend s sense but it made maggie still only look at her these were large words and large visions all the more that now really they spread and spread in the midst of them however mrs assingham had soon enough continued when i talk of knowing indeed i don t mean it as you would have a right todo you know because you see and i don t see him i don t makehim out she almost crudely confessed maggie again hesitated you mean you don t make out amerigo but fanny shook her head and it was quite as if as an appeal toone s intelligence the making out of amerigo had in spite ofeverything long been superseded then maggie measured the reachof her allusion and how what she next said gave her meaning arichness no other name was to be spoken and mrs assingham hadtaken that without delay from her eyes with a discretion still that fell short but by an inch you know how he feels maggie at this then slowly matched her headshake i knownothing you know how you feel but again she denied it i know nothing if i did well if you did fanny asked as she faltered she had had enough however i should die she said as sheturned away she went to her room through the quiet house she roamed there amoment picking up pointlessly a different fan and then tookher way to the shaded apartments in which at this hour theprincipino would be enjoying his nap she passed through thefirst empty room the day nursery and paused at an open door the inner room large dim and cool was equally calm her boy sample antique historical royal crib consecrated reputedly by the guarded rest of heirs apparent and a gift early in hiscareer from his grandfather ruled the scene from the centre inthe stillness of which she could almost hear the child s softbreathing the prime protector of his dreams was installed besidehim her father sat there with as little motion with head thrownback and supported with eyes apparently closed with the finefoot that was so apt to betray nervousness at peace upon theother knee with the unfathomable heart folded in the constantflawless freshness of the white waistcoat that could alwaysreceive in its armholes the firm prehensile thumbs mrs noblehad majestically melted and the whole place signed her temporaryabdication yet the actual situation was regular and maggielingered but to look she looked over her fan the top of whichwas pressed against her face long enough to wonder if her fatherreally slept or if aware of her he only kept consciously quiet did his eyes truly fix her between lids partly open and was sheto take this his forebearance from any question only as a signagain that everything was left to her she at all events for aminute watched his immobility then as if once more renewingher total submission returned without a sound to her ownquarters a strange impulse was sharp in her but it was not for her part the desire to shift the weight she could as little have slept asshe could have slept that morning days before when she hadwatched the first dawn from her window turned to the east thisside of her room was now in shade with the two wings of thecasement folded back and the charm she always found in herseemingly perched position as if her outlook from above thehigh terraces was that of some castle tower mounted on a rock when she stood there she hung over over the gardens and thewoods all of which drowsed below her at this hour in theimmensity of light the miles of shade looked hot the banks offlowers looked dim the peacocks on the balustrades let theirtails hang limp and the smaller birds lurked among the leaves nothing therefore would have appeared to stir in the brilliantvoid if maggie at the moment she was about to turn away had notcaught sight of a moving spot a clear green sunshade in the actof descending a flight of steps it passed down from the terrace receding at a distance from sight and carried naturally soas to conceal the head and back of its bearer but maggie hadquickly recognised the white dress and the particular motion ofthis adventurer had taken in that charlotte of all people hadchosen the glare of noon for an exploration of the gardens andthat she could be betaking herself only to some unvisited quarterdeep in them or beyond them that she had already marked as asuperior refuge the princess kept her for a few minutes insight watched her long enough to feel her by the mere betrayalof her pace and direction driven in a kind of flight and thenunderstood for herself why the act of sitting still had becomeimpossible to either of them there came to her confusedly someecho of an ancient fable some vision of io goaded by the gadflyor of ariadne roaming the lone sea strand it brought with it allthe sense of her own intention and desire she too might havebeen for the hour some far off harassed heroine only with apart to play for which she knew exactly no inspiring precedent she knew but that all the while all the while of her sittingthere among the others without her she had wanted to go straightto this detached member of the party and make somehow for hersupport the last demonstration a pretext was all that wasneedful and maggie after another instant had found one she had caught a glimpse before mrs verver disappeared of hercarrying a book made out half lost in the folds of her whitedress the dark cover of a volume that was to explain her purposein case of her being met with surprise and the mate of which precisely now lay on maggie s table the book was an old novelthat the princess had a couple of days before mentioned havingbrought down from portland place in the charming original form ofits three volumes charlotte had hailed with a specious glitterof interest the opportunity to read it and our young woman had thereupon on the morrow directed her maid to carry it to mrs verver s apartments she was afterwards to observe that thismessenger unintelligent or inadvertent had removed but one ofthe volumes which happened not to be the first still possessed accordingly of the first while charlotte going out fantastically at such an hour to cultivate romance in anarbour was helplessly armed with the second maggie prepared onthe spot to sally forth with succour the right volume with aparasol was all she required in addition that is to thebravery of her general idea she passed again through the house unchallenged and emerged upon the terrace which she followed hugging the shade with that consciousness of turning the tableson her friend which we have already noted but so far as shewent after descending into the open and beginning to explore thegrounds mrs verver had gone still further with the increase ofthe oddity moreover of her having exchanged the protection ofher room for these exposed and shining spaces it was not fortunately however at last that by persisting in pursuit onedidn t arrive at regions of admirable shade this was the asylum presumably that the poor wandering woman had had in view several wide alleys in particular of great length denselyoverarched with the climbing rose and the honeysuckle andconverging in separate green vistas at a sort of umbrageoustemple an ancient rotunda pillared and statued niched androofed yet with its uncorrected antiquity like that ofeverything else at fawns conscious hitherto of no violence fromthe present and no menace from the future charlotte had pausedthere in her frenzy or what ever it was to be called the placewas a conceivable retreat and she was staring before her fromthe seat to which she appeared to have sunk all unwittingly asmaggie stopped at the beginning of one of the perspectives it was a repetition more than ever then of the evening on theterrace the distance was too great to assure her she had beenimmediately seen but the princess waited with her intention ascharlotte on the other occasion had waited allowing ohallowing for the difference of the intention maggie was full ofthe sense of that so full that it made her impatient whereuponshe moved forward a little placing herself in range of the eyesthat had been looking off elsewhere but that she had suddenlycalled to recognition charlotte had evidently not dreamed ofbeing followed and instinctively with her pale stare shestiffened herself for protest maggie could make that out aswell as further however that her second impression of herfriend s approach had an instant effect on her attitude theprincess came nearer gravely and in silence but fairly pausedagain to give her time for whatever she would whatever shewould whatever she could was what maggie wanted wanting aboveall to make it as easy for her as the case permitted that wasnot what charlotte had wanted the other night but this nevermattered the great thing was to allow her was fairly to producein her the sense of highly choosing at first clearly she hadbeen frightened she had not been pursued it had quickly struckher without some design on the part of her pursuer and whatmight she not be thinking of in addition but the way she had when herself the pursuer made her stepdaughter take in herspirit and her purpose it had sunk into maggie at the time thathard insistence and mrs verver had felt it and seen it andheard it sink which wonderful remembrance of pressuresuccessfully applied had naturally till now remained with her but her stare was like a projected fear that the buried treasure so dishonestly come by for which her companion s stillcountenance at the hour and afterwards had consented to serveas the deep soil might have worked up again to the surface tobe thrown back upon her hands yes it was positive that duringone of these minutes the princess had the vision of herparticular alarm it s her lie it s her lie that has mortallydisagreed with her she can keep down no longer her rebellion atit and she has come to retract it to disown it and denounceit to give me full in my face the truth instead this for aconcentrated instant maggie felt her helplessly gasp but onlyto let it bring home the indignity the pity of her state sheherself could but tentatively hover place in view the book shecarried look as little dangerous look as abjectly mild aspossible remind herself really of people she had read about instories of the wild west people who threw up their hands oncertain occasions as a sign they weren t carrying revolvers shecould almost have smiled at last troubled as she yet knewherself to show how richly she was harmless she held up hervolume which was so weak a weapon and while she continued forconsideration to keep her distance she explained with asquenched a quaver as possible i saw you come out saw you frommy window and couldn t bear to think you should find yourselfhere without the beginning of your book this is the beginning you ve got the wrong volume and i ve brought you out the right she remained after she had spoken it was like holding a parleywith a possible adversary and her intense her exalted littlesmile asked for formal leave may i come nearer now she seemedto say as to which however the next minute she sawcharlotte s reply lose itself in a strange process a thing ofseveral sharp stages which she could stand there and trace thedread after a minute had dropped from her face though discernibly enough she still couldn t believe in her having inso strange a fashion been deliberately made up to if she hadbeen made up to at least it was with an idea the idea that hadstruck her at first as necessarily dangerous that it wasn t insistently wasn t this shone from maggie with a force finallynot to be resisted and on that perception on the immense reliefso constituted everything had by the end of three minutesextraordinarily changed maggie had come out to her really because she knew her doomed doomed to a separation that was likea knife in her heart and in the very sight of heruncontrollable her blinded physical quest of a peace not to begrasped something of mrs assingham s picture of her as thrown for a grim future beyond the great sea and the great continenthad at first found fulfilment she had got away in thisfashion burning behind her almost the ships of disguise tolet her horror of what was before her play up without witnesses and even after maggie s approach had presented an innocent frontit was still not to be mistaken that she bristled with the signsof her extremity it was not to be said for them either thatthey were draped at this hour in any of her usual graces unveiled and all but unashamed they were tragic to the princessin spite of the dissimulation that with the return ofcomparative confidence was so promptly to operate how tragic in essence the very change made vivid the instant stiffening ofthe spring of pride this for possible defence if not forpossible aggression pride indeed the next moment had becomethe mantle caught up for protection and perversity she flung itround her as a denial of any loss of her freedom to be doomedwas in her situation to have extravagantly incurred a doom sothat to confess to wretchedness was by the same stroke toconfess to falsity she wouldn t confess she didn t a thousandtimes no she only cast about her and quite frankly andfiercely for something else that would give colour to her havingburst her bonds her eyes expanded her bosom heaved as sheinvoked it and the effect upon maggie was verily to wish shecould only help her to it she presently got up which seemed tomean oh stay if you like and when she had moved about awhileat random looking away looking at anything at everything buther visitor when she had spoken of the temperature and declaredthat she revelled in it when she had uttered her thanks for thebook which a little incoherently with her second volume sheperhaps found less clever than she expected when she had letmaggie approach sufficiently closer to lay untouched thetribute in question on a bench and take up obligingly itssuperfluous mate when she had done these things she sat down inanother place more or less visibly in possession of her part our young woman was to have passed in all her adventure nostranger moments for she not only now saw her companion fairlyagree to take her then for the poor little person she was findingit so easy to appear but fell in a secret responsive ecstasy to wondering if there were not some supreme abjection with whichshe might be inspired vague but increasingly brighter thispossibility glimmered on her it at last hung there adequatelyplain to charlotte that she had presented herself once more to as they said grovel and that truly made the stage large ithad absolutely within the time taken on the dazzling merit ofbeing large for each of them alike i m glad to see you alone there s something i ve been wantingto say to you i m tired said mrs verver i m tired tired it had dropped the next thing it couldn t all come atonce but maggie had already guessed what it was and the flushof recognition was in her face tired of this life the one we ve been leading you like it iknow but i ve dreamed another dream she held up her head now her lighted eyes more triumphantly rested she was finding shewas following her way maggie by the same influence sat insight of it there was something she was saving some quantity ofwhich she herself was judge and it was for a long moment evenwith the sacrifice the princess had come to make a good deallike watching her from the solid shore plunge into uncertain into possibly treacherous depths i see something else shewent on i ve an idea that greatly appeals to me i ve had itfor a long time it has come over me that we re wrong our reallife isn t here maggie held her breath ours my husband s and mine i m not speaking for you oh said maggie only praying not to be not even to appear stupid i m speaking for ourselves i m speaking charlotte broughtout for him i see for my father for your father for whom else they looked at each other hardnow but maggie s face took refuge in the intensity of herinterest she was not at all even so stupid as to treat hercompanion s question as requiring an answer a discretion thather controlled stillness had after an instant justified imust risk your thinking me selfish for of course you know whatit involves let me admit it i am selfish i place my husbandfirst well said maggie smiling and smiling since that s where iplace mine you mean you ll have no quarrel with me so much the betterthen for charlotte went on with a higher and higher flight my plan is completely formed maggie waited her glimmer had deepened her chance somehow wasat hand the only danger was her spoiling it she felt herselfskirting an abyss what then may i ask is your plan it hung fire but ten seconds it came out sharp to take himhome to his real position and not to wait do you mean a this season i mean immediately and i may as well tell you now i mean formy own time i want charlotte said to have him at last alittle to myself i want strange as it may seem to you and shegave it all its weight to keep the man i ve married and to doso i see i must act maggie with the effort still to follow the right line feltherself colour to the eyes immediately she thoughtfullyechoed as soon as we can get off the removal of everything is afterall but a detail that can always be done with money as hespends it everything can what i ask for charlotte declared is the definite break and i wish it now with which her head like her voice rose higher oh she added i know mydifficulty far down below the level of attention in she could scarce havesaid what sacred depths maggie s inspiration had come and ithad trembled the next moment into sound do you mean i m yourdifficulty you and he together since it s always with you that i ve had tosee him but it s a difficulty that i m facing if you wish toknow that i ve already faced that i propose to myself tosurmount the struggle with it none too pleasant hasn t beenfor me as you may imagine in itself charming i ve felt in itat times if i must tell you all too great and too strange anugliness yet i believe it may succeed she had risen with this mrs verver and had moved for theemphasis of it a few steps away while maggie motionless atfirst but sat and looked at her you want to take my fatherfrom me the sharp successful almost primitive wail in it made charlotteturn and this movement attested for the princess the felicity ofher deceit something in her throbbed as it had throbbed thenight she stood in the drawing room and denied that she hadsuffered she was ready to lie again if her companion would butgive her the opening then she should know she had done all charlotte looked at her hard as if to compare her face with hernote of resentment and maggie feeling this met it with thesigns of an impression that might pass for the impression ofdefeat i want really to possess him said mrs verver ihappen also to feel that he s worth it maggie rose as if to receive her oh worth it she wonderfullythrew off the tone she instantly saw again had its effect charlotteflamed aloft might truly have been believing in her passionateparade you ve thought you ve known what he s worth indeed then my dear i believe i have as i believe i stilldo she had given it maggie straight back and again it had notmissed charlotte for another moment only looked at her thenbroke into the words maggie had known they would come of whichshe had pressed the spring how i see that you loathed ourmarriage do you ask me maggie after an instant demanded charlotte had looked about her picked up the parasol she hadlaid on a bench possessed herself mechanically of one of thevolumes of the relegated novel and then more consciously flungit down again she was in presence visibly of her last word she opened her sunshade with a click she twirled it on hershoulder in her pride ask you do i need how i see shebroke out that you ve worked against me oh oh oh the princess exclaimed her companion leaving her had reached one of the archways buton this turned round with a flare you haven t worked againstme maggie took it and for a moment kept it held it with closedeyes as if it had been some captured fluttering bird pressed byboth hands to her breast then she opened her eyes to speak what does it matter if i ve failed you recognise then that you ve failed asked charlotte from thethreshold maggie waited she looked as her companion had done a momentbefore at the two books on the seat she put them together andlaid them down then she made up her mind i ve failed shesounded out before charlotte having given her time walked away she watched her splendid and erect float down the long vista then she sank upon a seat yes she had done all part sixth xl i ll do anything you like she said to her husband on one ofthe last days of the month if our being here this way at thistime seems to you too absurd or too uncomfortable or tooimpossible we ll either take leave of them now withoutwaiting or we ll come back in time three days before theystart i ll go abroad with you if you but say the word toswitzerland the tyrol the italian alps to whichever of yourold high places you would like most to see again those beautifulones that used to do you good after rome and that you so oftentold me about where they were in the conditions that prompted this offer andwhere it might indeed appear ridiculous that with the stalelondon september close at hand they should content themselveswith remaining was where the desert of portland place lookedblank as it had never looked and where a drowsy cabman scanningthe horizon for a fare could sink to oblivion of the risks ofimmobility but amerigo was of the odd opinion day after day that their situation couldn t be bettered and he even went at nomoment through the form of replying that should their ordealstrike her as exceeding their patience any step they might takewould be for her own relief this was no doubt partly becausehe stood out so wonderfully to the end against admitting by aweak word at least that any element of their existence was orever had been an ordeal no trap of circumstance no lapse of form no accident of irritation had landed him in thatinconsequence his wife might verily have suggested that he wasconsequent consequent with the admirable appearance he had fromthe first so undertaken and so continued to present rather toorigidly at her expense only as it happened she was not thelittle person to do anything of the sort and the strange tacitcompact

to come out at the right endif she would see him this understanding tacitly renewed fromweek to week had fairly received with the procession of theweeks the consecration of time but it scarce needed to beinsisted on that she was seeing him on his terms not all onhers or that in other words she must allow him his unexplainedand uncharted his one practicably workable way if that way byone of the intimate felicities the liability to which was so farfrom having even yet completely fallen from him happenedhandsomely to show him as more bored than boring with advantagesof his own freely to

forevery eye on her possible her impossible defection she mustkeep it up to the last mustn t absent herself for three minutesfrom her post only on those lines assuredly would she showherself as with him and not against him it was extraordinary how scant a series of signs she had invitedhim to make of being of truly having been at any time with his wife that reflection she was not exempt from as they now intheir suspense supremely waited a reflection under the brush ofwhich she recognised her having had in respect to him as well to do all to go the whole way over to move indefatigably while he stood as fixed in his place as some statue of one of hisforefathers the meaning of it would seem to be she reasoned insequestered hours that he had a place and that this was anattribute somehow indefeasible unquenchable which laid uponothers from the moment they definitely wanted anything of him the necessity of taking more of the steps that he could ofcircling round him of remembering for his benefit the famousrelation of the mountain to mahomet it was strange if one hadgone into it but such a place as amerigo s was like somethingmade for him beforehand by innumerable facts facts largely ofthe sort known as historical made by ancestors examples traditions habits while maggie s own had come to show simply asthat improvised post a post of the kind spoken of asadvanced with which she was to have found herself connected inthe fashion of a settler or a trader in a new country in thelikeness even of some indian squaw with a papoose on her back andbarbarous bead work to sell

awful appointed scale andstyle of which had at no moment loomed so large to maggie s mindas one day when the dear assinghams swam back into her kenbesprinkled with sawdust and looking as pale as if they had seensamson pull down the temple they had seen at least what she wasnot seeing rich dim things under the impression of which theyhad retired she having eyes at present but for the clock bywhich she timed her husband or for the glass the image perhapswould be truer in which he was reflected to her as he timed thepair in the country the accession of their friends from cadoganplace contributed to all their intermissions at any rate acertain effect of resonance an effect especially marked by theupshot of a prompt exchange of inquiries between mrs assinghamand the princess it was noted on the occasion of that anxiouslady s last approach to her young friend at fawns that hersympathy had ventured after much accepted privation again tobecome inquisitive and it had perhaps never so yielded to thatneed as on this question of the present odd line of thedistinguished eccentrics you mean to say really that you re going to stick here andthen before maggie could answer what on earth will you do withyour evenings maggie waited a moment maggie could still tentatively smile when people learn we re here and of course the papers will befull of it they ll flock back in their hundreds from whereverthey are to catch us you see you and the colonel haveyourselves done it as for our evenings they won t i dare say be particularly different from anything else that s ours theywon t be different from our mornings or our afternoons exceptperhaps that you two dears will sometimes help us to get throughthem i ve offered to go anywhere she added to take a houseif he will but this just this and nothing else is amerigo sidea he gave it yesterday she went on a name that as hesaid described and fitted it so you see and the princessindulged again in her smile that didn t play but that only asmight have been said worked so you see there s a method in ourmadness it drew mrs assingham s wonder and what then is the name the reduction to its simplest expression of what we aredoing that s what he called it therefore as we re doingnothing we re doing it in the most aggravated way which is theway he desires with which maggie further said of course iunderstand so do i her visitor after a moment breathed you ve had tovacate the house that was inevitable but at least here hedoesn t funk our young woman accepted the expression he doesn t funk it only however half contented fanny who thoughtfully raisedher eyebrows he s prodigious but what is there as you ve fixed it to dodge unless she pursued it s her gettingnear him it s if you ll pardon my vulgarity her getting athim that she suggested may count with him but it found the princess prepared she can get near him here she can get at him she can come up can she fanny assingham questioned can t she maggie returned their eyes for a minute intimately met on it after which theelder woman said i mean for seeing him alone so do i said the princess at which fanny for her reasons couldn t help smiling oh ifit s for that he s staying he s staying i ve made it out to take anything that comes orcalls upon him to take maggie went on even that then sheput it as she had at last put it to herself he s staying forhigh decency decency mrs assingham gravely echoed decency if she should try well mrs assingham urged well i hope hope he ll see her maggie hesitated however she made no direct reply it suseless hoping she presently said she won t but he oughtto her friend s expression of a moment before which had beenapologised for as vulgar prolonged its sharpness to her ear that of an electric bell under continued pressure stated sosimply what was it but dreadful truly that the feasibility ofcharlotte s getting at the man who for so long had loved hershould now be in question strangest of all things doubtless this care of maggie s as to what might make for it or makeagainst it stranger still her fairly lapsing at moments into avague calculation of the conceivability on her own part withher husband of some direct sounding of the subject would it betoo monstrous her suddenly breaking out to him as in alarm atthe lapse of the weeks wouldn t it really seem that you rebound in honour to do something for her privately before theygo maggie was capable of weighing the risk of this adventurefor her own spirit capable of sinking to intense littleabsences even while conversing as now with the person who hadmost of her confidence during which she followed up thepossibilities it was true that mrs assingham could at suchtimes somewhat restore the balance by not wholly failing toguess her thought her thought however just at present hadmore than one face had a series that it successively presented these were indeed the possibilities involved in the adventure ofher concerning herself for the quantity of compensation that mrs verver might still look to there was always the possibility thatshe was after all sufficiently to get at him there was in factthat of her having again and again done so against this stoodnothing but fanny assingham s apparent belief in her privation more mercilessly imposed or more hopelessly felt in the actualrelation of the parties over and beyond everything that frommore than three months back of course had fostered in theprincess a like conviction these assumptions might certainly bebaseless inasmuch as there were hours and hours of amerigo stime that there was no habit no pretence of his accounting for inasmuch too as charlotte inevitably had had more than once tothe undisguised knowledge of the pair in portland place beenobliged to come up to eaton square whence so many of herpersonal possessions were in course of removal she didn t cometo portland place didn t even come to ask for luncheon on twoseparate occasions when it reached the consciousness of thehousehold there that she was spending the day in london maggiehated she scorned to compare hours and appearances to weighthe idea of whether there hadn t been moments during these days when an assignation in easy conditions a snatched interview inan air the season had so cleared of prying eyes mightn tperfectly work but the very reason of this was partly that haunted with the vision of the poor woman carrying off with suchbravery as she found to her hand the secret of her not beingappeased she was conscious of scant room for any alternativeimage the alternative image would have been that the secretcovered up was the secret of appeasement somehow obtained somehow extorted and cherished and the difference between thetwo kinds of hiding was too great to permit of a mistake charlotte was hiding neither pride nor joy she was hidinghumiliation and here it was that the princess s passion sopowerless for vindictive flights most inveterately bruised itstenderness against the hard glass of her question behind the glass lurked the whole history of the relation she hadso fairly flattened her nose against it to penetrate the glassmrs verver might at this stage have been frantically tapping from within by way of supreme irrepressible entreaty maggiehad said to herself complacently after that last passage withher stepmother in the garden of fawns that there was nothingleft for her to do and that she could thereupon fold her hands but why wasn t it still left to push further and from the pointof view of personal pride grovel lower why wasn t it stillleft to offer herself as the bearer of a message reporting to himtheir friend s anguish and convincing him of her need she could thus have translated mrs verver s tap against theglass as i have called it into fifty forms could perhaps havetranslated it most into the form of a reminder that would piercedeep you don t know what it is to have been loved and brokenwith you haven t been broken with because in your relation whatcan there have been worth speaking of to break ours waseverything a relation could be filled to the brim with the wineof consciousness and if it was to have no meaning no bettermeaning than that such a creature as you could breathe upon it at your hour for blight why was i myself dealt with all fordeception why condemned after a couple of short years to findthe golden flame oh the golden flame a mere handful of blackashes our young woman so yielded at moments to what wasinsidious in these foredoomed ingenuities of her pity that forminutes together sometimes the weight of a new duty seemed torest upon her the duty of speaking before separation shouldconstitute its chasm of pleading for some benefit that might becarried away into exile like the last saved object of price ofthe emigre the jewel wrapped in a piece of old silk andnegotiable some day in the market of misery this imagined service to the woman who could no longer helpherself was one of the traps set for maggie s spirit at everyturn of the road the click of which catching and holding thedivine faculty fast was followed inevitably by a flutter by astruggle of wings and even as we may say by a scattering offine feathers for they promptly enough felt these yearnings ofthought and excursions of sympathy the concussion that couldn tbring them down the arrest produced by the so remarkablydistinct figure that at fawns for the previous weeks wasconstantly crossing in its regular revolution the further endof any watched perspective whoever knew or whoever didn t whether or to what extent charlotte with natural business ineaton square had shuffled other opportunities under that cloak it was all matter for the kind of quiet ponderation the littleman who so kept his wandering way had made his own it was partof the very inveteracy of his straw hat and his white waistcoat of the trick of his hands in his pockets of the detachment ofthe attention he fixed on his slow steps from behind his securepince nez the thing that never failed now as an item in thepicture was that gleam of the silken noose his wife s immaterialtether so marked to maggie s sense during her last month in thecountry mrs verver s straight neck had certainly not slippedit nor had the other end of the long cord oh quiteconveniently long disengaged its smaller loop from the hookedthumb that with his fingers closed upon it her husband kept outof sight to have recognised for all its tenuity the play ofthis gathered lasso might inevitably be to wonder with what magicit was twisted to what tension subjected but could never be todoubt either of its adequacy to its office or of its perfectdurability these reminded states for the princess were in factstates of renewed gaping so many things her father knew that sheeven yet didn t all this at present with mrs assingham passed through her inquick vibrations she had expressed while the revolution of herthought was incomplete the idea of what amerigo ought on hisside in the premises to be capable of and then had felt hercompanion s answering stare but she insisted on what she hadmeant he ought to wish to see her and i mean in some protectedand independent way as he used to in case of her being herselfable to manage it that said maggie with the courage of herconviction he ought to be ready he ought to be happy he oughtto feel himself sworn little as it is for the end of such ahistory to take from her it s as if he wished to get offwithout taking anything mrs assingham deferentially mused but for what purpose is ityour idea that they should again so intimately meet for any purpose they like that s their affair fanny assingham sharply laughed then irrepressibly fell back toher constant position you re splendid perfectly splendid towhich as the princess shaking an impatient head wouldn t haveit again at all she subjoined or if you re not it s becauseyou re so sure i mean sure of him ah i m exactly not sure of him if i were sure of him ishouldn t doubt but maggie cast about her doubt what fanny pressed as she waited well that he must feel how much less than she he pays and howthat ought to keep her present to him this in its turn after an instant mrs assingham could meetwith a smile trust him my dear to keep her present but trusthim also to keep himself absent leave him his own way i ll leave him everything said maggie only you know it s mynature i think it s your nature to think too much fanny assingham a triflecoarsely risked this but quickened however in the princess the act shereprobated that may be but if i hadn t thought you wouldn t you mean have been where you are yes because they on their side thought of everything butthat they thought of everything but that i might think or even her friend too superficially concurred that yourfather might as to this at all events maggie discriminated no thatwouldn t have prevented them for they knew that his first carewould be not to make me do so as it is maggie added that hashad to become his last fanny assingham took it in deeper for what it immediately madeher give out louder he s splendid then she sounded it almostaggressively it was what she was reduced to she had positivelyto place it ah that as much as you please maggie said this and left it but the tone of it had the nextmoment determined in her friend a fresh reaction you think both of you so abysmally and yet so quietly but it s what willhave saved you oh maggie returned it s what from the moment theydiscovered we could think at all will have saved them forthey re the ones who are saved she went on we re the ones whoare lost lost lost to each other father and i and then as her friendappeared to demur oh yes maggie quite lucidly declared lostto each other much more really than amerigo and charlotte are since for them it s just it s right it s deserved while for usit s only sad and strange and not caused by our fault but idon t know she went on why i talk about myself for it s onfather it really comes i let him go said maggie you let him but you don t make him i take it from him she answered but what else can you do i take it from him the princess repeated i do what i knewfrom the first i should do i get off by giving him up but if he gives you mrs assingham presumed to object doesn t it moreover then she asked complete the very purposewith which he married that of making you and leaving you morefree maggie looked at her long yes i help him to do that mrs assingham hesitated but at last her bravery flared whynot call it then frankly his complete success well said maggie that s all that s left me to do it s a success her friend ingeniously developed with whichyou ve simply not interfered and as if to show that she spokewithout levity mrs assingham went further he has made it asuccess for them ah there you are maggie responsively mused yes she saidthe next moment that s why amerigo stays let alone it s why charlotte goes that mrs assingham andemboldened smiled so he knows but maggie hung back amerigo after which however sheblushed to her companion s recognition your father he knows what you know i mean fanny faltered well how much does he know maggie s silence and maggie s eyeshad in fact arrested the push of the question which for adecent consistency she couldn t yet quite abandon what ishould rather say is does he know how much she found it stillawkward how much i mean they did how far she touched itup they went maggie had waited but only with a question do you think hedoes know at least something oh about him i can t think he sbeyond me said fanny assingham then do you yourself know how much how much how far how far fanny had appeared to wish to make sure but there was somethingshe remembered remembered in time and even with a smile i vetold you before that i know absolutely nothing well that s what i know said the princess her friend again hesitated then nobody knows i mean mrs assingham explained how much your father does oh maggie showed that she understood nobody not a little charlotte a little the princess echoed to know anything would be forher to know enough and she doesn t know anything if she did maggie answered amerigo would and that s just it that he doesn t that s just it said the princess profoundly on which mrs assingham reflected then how is charlotte soheld just by that by her ignorance by her ignorance fanny wondered a torment a torment said maggie with tears in her eyes her companion a moment watched them but the prince then how is he held maggie asked how is he held oh i can t tell you that and the princess again broke off xlia telegram in charlotte s name arrived early we shall comeand ask you for tea at five if convenient to you am wiring forthe assinghams to lunch this document into which meanings wereto be read maggie promptly placed before her husband adding theremark that her father and his wife who would have come up theprevious night or that morning had evidently gone to an hotel the prince was in his own room where he often sat now alone half a dozen open newspapers the figaro notably as well asthe times were scattered about him but with a cigar in histeeth and a visible cloud on his brow he appeared actually to beengaged in walking to and fro never yet on thus approachinghim for she had done it of late under one necessity or another several times had a particular impression so greeted her supremely strong for some reason as he turned quickly round onher entrance the reason was partly the look in his face asuffusion like the flush of fever which brought back to herfanny assingham s charge recently uttered under that roof ofher thinking too impenetrably the word had remained with herand made her think still more so that at first as she stoodthere she felt responsible for provoking on his part anirritation of suspense at which she had not aimed she had beengoing about him these three months she perfectly knew with amaintained idea of which she had never spoken to him but whathad at last happened was that his way of looking at her onoccasion seemed a perception of the presence not of one idea but of fifty variously prepared for uses with which he somehowmust reckon she knew herself suddenly almost strangely glad tobe coming to him at this hour with nothing more abstract than atelegram but even after she had stepped into his prison underher pretext while her eyes took in his face and then embracedthe four walls that enclosed his restlessness she recognised thevirtual identity of his condition with that aspect of charlotte ssituation for which early in the summer and in all the amplitudeof a great residence she had found with so little seeking thesimilitude of the locked cage he struck her as caged the manwho couldn t now without an instant effect on her sensibilitygive an instinctive push to the door she had not completelyclosed behind her he had been turning twenty ways forimpatiences all his own and when she was once shut in with himit was yet again as if she had come to him in his more thanmonastic cell to offer him light or food there was a differencenone the less between his captivity and charlotte s thedifference as it might be of his lurking there by his own actand his own choice the admission of which had indeed virtuallybeen in his starting on her entrance as if even this were inits degree an interference that was what betrayed for her practically his fear of her fifty ideas and what had begun after a minute to make her wish to repudiate or explain it wasmore wonderful than she could have told it was for all the worldas if she was succeeding with him beyond her intention she had for these instants the sense that he exaggerated that theimputation of purpose had fairly risen too high in him she hadbegun a year ago by asking herself how she could make him thinkmore of her but what was it after all he was thinking now hekept his eyes on her telegram he read it more than once easy asit was in spite of its conveyed deprecation to understand during which she found herself almost awestruck with yearning almost on the point of marking somehow what she had marked in thegarden at fawns with charlotte that she had truly come unarmed she didn t bristle with intentions she scarce knew as he atthis juncture affected her what had become of the only intentionshe had come with she had nothing but her old idea the old onehe knew she hadn t the ghost of another presently in fact whenfour or five minutes had elapsed it was as if she positively hadn t so much even as that one he gave her back her paper asking with it if there were anything in particular she wishedhim to do she stood there with her eyes on him doubling the telegramtogether as if it had been a precious thing and yet all the whileholding her breath of a sudden somehow and quite as by theaction of their merely having between them these few writtenwords an extraordinary fact came up he was with her as if hewere hers hers in a degree and on a scale with an intensity andan intimacy that were a new and a strange quantity that werelike the irruption of a tide loosening them where they had stuckand making them feel they floated what was it that with therush of this just kept her from putting out her hands to him from catching at him as in the other time with the superficialimpetus he and charlotte had privately conspired to impart shehad so often her breath failing her known the impulse to catchat her father she did however just yet nothing inconsequent though she couldn t immediately have said what saved her and bythe time she had neatly folded her telegram she was doingsomething merely needful i wanted you simply to know so thatyou mayn t by accident miss them for it s the last saidmaggie the last i take it as their good bye and she smiled as she could alwayssmile they come in state to take formal leave they doeverything that s proper tomorrow she said they go tosouthampton if they do everything that s proper the prince presentlyasked why don t they at least come to dine she hesitated yet she lightly enough provided her answer thatwe must certainly ask them it will be easy for you but ofcourse they re immensely taken he wondered so immensely taken that they can t that yourfather can t give you his last evening in england this for maggie was more difficult to meet yet she was stillnot without her stop gap that may be what they ll propose thatwe shall go somewhere together the four of us for acelebration except that to round it thoroughly off we oughtalso to have fanny and the colonel they don t want them at tea she quite sufficiently expresses they polish them off poordears they get rid of them beforehand they want only ustogether and if they cut us down to tea she continued asthey cut fanny and the colonel down to luncheon perhaps it s forthe fancy after all of their keeping their last night in londonfor each other she said these things as they came to her she was unable to keepthem back even though as she heard herself she might have beenthrowing everything to the winds but wasn t that the right way for sharing his last day of captivity with the man one adored itwas every moment more and more for her as if she were waitingwith him in his prison waiting with some gleam of remembrance ofhow noble captives in the french revolution the darkness of theterror used to make a feast or a high discourse of their lastpoor resources if she had broken with everything now everyobservance of all the past months she must simply then take itso take it that what she had worked for was too near at last to let her keep her head she might have been losing her headverily in her husband s eyes since he didn t know all thewhile that the sudden freedom of her words was but the divertedintensity of her disposition personally to seize him he didn tknow either that this was her manner now she was with him ofbeguiling audaciously the supremacy of suspense for the peopleof the french revolution assuredly there wasn t suspense thescaffold for those she was thinking of was certain whereaswhat charlotte s telegram announced was short of someincalculable error clear liberation just the point however was in its being clearer to herself than to him her clearnesses clearances those she had so all but abjectly laboured for threatened to crowd upon her in the form of one of the clustersof angelic heads the peopled shafts of light beating downthrough iron bars that regale on occasion precisely thefevered vision of those who are in chains she was going to know she felt later on was going to know with compunction doubtless on the very morrow how thumpingly her heart hadbeaten at this foretaste of their being left together she shouldjudge at leisure the surrender she was making to theconsciousness of complications about to be bodily lifted sheshould judge at leisure even that avidity for an issue which wasmaking so little of any complication but the unextinguishedpresence of the others and indeed that she was alreadysimplifying so much more than her husband came out for her nextin the face with which he listened he might certainly well bepuzzled in respect to his father in law and mrs verver by herglance at their possible preference for a concentrated evening but it isn t is it he asked as if they were leaving eachother oh no it isn t as if they were leaving each other they re onlybringing to a close without knowing when it may open again atime that has been naturally awfully interesting to them yes she could talk so of their time she was somehow sustained shewas sustained even to affirm more intensely her presentpossession of her ground they have their reasons many thingsto think of how can one tell but there s always also thechance of his proposing to me that we shall have our last hourstogether i mean that he and i shall he may wish to take me offto dine with him somewhere alone and to do it in memory of olddays i mean the princess went on the real old days beforemy grand husband was invented and much more before his grandwife was the wonderful times of his first great interest in whathe has since done his first great plans and opportunities discoveries and bargains the way we ve sat together late everso late in foreign restaurants which he used to like the waythat in every city in europe we ve stayed on and on with ourelbows on the table and most of the lights put out to talk overthings he had that day seen or heard of or made his offer for the things he had secured or refused or lost there were placeshe took me to you wouldn t believe for often he could onlyhave left me with servants if he should carry me off with himto night for old sake s sake to the earl s court exhibition itwill be a little just a very very little like our youngadventures after which while amerigo watched her and in factquite because of it she had an inspiration to which shepresently yielded if he was wondering what she would say nextshe had found exactly the thing in that case he will leave youcharlotte to take care of in our absence you ll have to carryher off somewhere for your last evening unless you may prefer tospend it with her here i shall then see that you dine that youhave everything quite beautifully you ll be able to do as youlike she couldn t have been sure beforehand and had really not been but the most immediate result of this speech was his letting hersee that he took it for no cheap extravagance either of irony orof oblivion nothing in the world of a truth had ever been sosweet to her as his look of trying to be serious enough to makeno mistake about it she troubled him which hadn t been at allher purpose she mystified him which she couldn t help and comparatively didn t mind then it came over her that he had after all a simplicity very considerable on which she hadnever dared to presume it was a discovery not like the otherdiscovery she had once made but giving out a freshness and sherecognised again in the light of it the number of the ideas ofwhich he thought her capable they were all apparently queerfor him but she had at least with the lapse of the months created the perception that there might be something in them whereby he stared there beautiful and sombre at what she was atpresent providing him with there was something of his own in hismind to which she was sure he referred everything for ameasure and a meaning he had never let go of it from theevening weeks before when in her room after his encounterwith the bloomsbury cup she had planted it there by flinging itat him on the question of her father s view of him herdetermined find out for yourself she had been aware duringthe months that he had been trying to find out and had beenseeking above all to avoid the appearance of any evasions ofsuch a form of knowledge as might reach him with violence orwith a penetration more insidious from any other source nothing however had reached him nothing he could at allconveniently reckon with had disengaged itself for him even fromthe announcement sufficiently sudden of the final secession oftheir companions charlotte was in pain charlotte was intorment but he himself had given her reason enough for that and in respect to the rest of the whole matter of her obligationto follow her husband that personage and she maggie had soshuffled away every link between consequence and cause that theintention remained like some famous poetic line in a deadlanguage subject to varieties of interpretation what renewedthe obscurity was her strange image of their common offer to him her father s and her own of an opportunity to separate from mrs verver with the due amount of form and all the more that he was in so pathetic a way unable to treat himself to a quarrel withit on the score of taste taste in him as a touchstone was nowall at sea for who could say but that one of her fifty ideas orperhaps forty nine of them wouldn t be exactly that taste byitself the taste he had always conformed to had no importancewhatever if meanwhile at all events he felt her as serious this made the greater reason for her profiting by it as sheperhaps might never be able to profit again she was invokingthat reflection at the very moment he brought out in reply toher last words a remark which though perfectly relevant andperfectly just affected her at first as a high oddity they redoing the wisest thing you know for if they were ever togo and he looked down at her over his cigar if they were ever to go in short it was high time with herfather s age charlotte s need of initiation and the generalmagnitude of the job of their getting settled and seasoned theirlearning to live into their queer future it was high time thatthey should take up their courage this was eminent sense but itdidn t arrest the princess who the next moment had found aform for her challenge but shan t you then so much as miss hera little she s wonderful and beautiful and i feel somehow as ifshe were dying not really not physically maggie went on she s so far naturally splendid as she is from having donewith life but dying for us for you and me and making us feelit by the very fact of there being so much of her left the prince smoked hard a minute as you say she s splendid butthere is there always will be much of her left only as youalso say for others and yet i think the princess returned that it isn t as if wehad wholly done with her how can we not always think of her it s as if her unhappiness had been necessary to us as if we hadneeded her at her own cost to build us up and start us he took it in with consideration but he met it with a lucidinquiry why do you speak of the unhappiness of your father swife they exchanged a long look the time that it took her to find herreply because not to well not to would make me have to speak of him and i can t said maggie speak of him you can t i can t she said it as for definite notice not to berepeated there are too many things she nevertheless added he s too great the prince looked at his cigar tip and then as he put back theweed too great for whom upon which as she hesitated not mydear too great for you he declared for me oh as much asyou like too great for me is what i mean i know why i think it maggiesaid that s enough he looked at her yet again as if she but fanned his wonder hewas on the very point she judged of asking her why she thoughtit but her own eyes maintained their warning and at the end ofa minute he had uttered other words what s of importance isthat you re his daughter that at least we ve got and i supposethat if i may say nothing else i may say at least that i valueit oh yes you may say that you value it i myself make the most ofit this again he took in letting it presently put forth for him astriking connection she ought to have known you that s what spresent to me she ought to have understood you better better than you did yes he gravely maintained better than i did and she didn treally know you at all she doesn t know you now ah yes she does said maggie but he shook his head he knew what he meant she not onlydoesn t understand you more than i she understands you ever somuch less though even i well even you maggie pressed as he paused even i even ieven yet again he paused and the silence held them but maggie at last broke it if charlotte doesn t understand me it is that i ve prevented her i ve chosen to deceive her and tolie to her the prince kept his eyes on her i know what you ve chosen todo but i ve chosen to do the same yes said maggie after an instant my choice was made when ihad guessed yours but you mean she asked that sheunderstands you it presents small difficulty are you so sure maggie went on sure enough but it doesn t matter he waited an instant thenlooking up through the fumes of his smoke she s stupid heabruptly opined o oh maggie protested in a long wail it had made him in fact quickly change colour what i mean isthat she s not as you pronounce her unhappy and he recovered with this all his logic why is she unhappy if she doesn tknow doesn t know she tried to make his logic difficult doesn t know that you know it came from him in such a way that she was conscious instantly of three or four things to answer but what she said first was do you think that s all it need take and before he couldreply she knows she knows maggie proclaimed well then what but she threw back her head she turned impatiently away fromhim oh i needn t tell you she knows enough besides shewent on she doesn t believe us it made the prince stare a little ah she asks too much thatdrew however from his wife another moan of objection whichdetermined in him a judgment she won t let you take her forunhappy oh i know better than any one else what she won t let me takeher for very well said amerigo you ll see i shall see wonders i know i ve already seen them and i mprepared for them maggie recalled she had memories enough it s terrible her memories prompted her to speak i see it salways terrible for women the prince looked down in his gravity everything s terrible cara in the heart of man she s making her life he said she ll make it his wife turned back upon him she had wandered to a table vaguely setting objects straight a little by the way then too while she s about it she s making ours at this he raised hiseyes which met her own and she held him while she deliveredherself of some thing that had been with her these last minutes you spoke just now of charlotte s not having learned from youthat i know am i to take from you then that you accept andrecognise my knowledge he did the inquiry all the honours visibly weighed itsimportance and weighed his response you think i might have beenshowing you that a little more handsomely it isn t a question of any beauty said maggie it s only aquestion of the quantity of truth oh the quantity of truth the prince richly thoughambiguously murmured that s a thing by itself yes but there are also such things all the same as questions of good faith of course there are the prince hastened to reply after whichhe brought up more slowly if ever a man since the beginning oftime acted in good faith but he dropped it offering it simplyfor that for that then when it had had time somewhat to settle like somehandful of gold dust thrown into the air for that then maggieshowed herself as deeply and strangely taking it i see andshe even wished this form to be as complete as she could make it i see the completeness clearly after an instant had struck him asdivine ah my dear my dear my dear it was all he couldsay she wasn t talking however at large you ve kept up for solong a silence yes yes i know what i ve kept up but will you do he asked still one thing more for me it was as if for an instant with her new exposure it had madeher turn pale is there even one thing left ah my dear my dear my dear it had pressed again in him thefine spring of the unspeakable there was nothing however thatthe princess herself couldn t say i ll do anything if you lltell me what then wait and his raised italian hand with its play ofadmonitory fingers had never made gesture more expressive hisvoice itself dropped to a tone wait he repeated wait she understood but it was as if she wished to have it from him till they ve been here you mean yes till they ve gone till they re away she kept it up till they ve left the country she had her eyeson him for clearness these were the conditions of a promise sothat he put the promise practically into his response tillwe ve ceased to see them for as long as god may grant tillwe re really alone oh if it s only that when she had drawn from him thus then as she could feel the thick breath of the definite which wasthe intimate the immediate the familiar as she hadn t had themfor so long she turned away again she put her hand on the knobof the door but her hand rested at first without a grasp shehad another effort to make the effort of leaving him of whicheverything that had just passed between them his presence irresistible overcharged with it doubled the difficulty therewas something she couldn t have told what it was as if shut intogether they had come too far too far for where they were sothat the mere act of her quitting him was like the attempt torecover the lost and gone she had taken in with her somethingthat within the ten minutes and especially within the lastthree or four had slipped away from her which it was vain now wasn t it to try to appear to clutch or to pick up thatconsciousness in fact had a pang and she balanced intensely for the lingering moment almost with a terror of her endlesspower of surrender he had only to press really for her toyield inch by inch and she fairly knew at present while shelooked at him through her cloud that the confession of thisprecious secret sat there for him to pluck the sensation forthe few seconds was extraordinary her weakness her desire solong as she was yet not saving herself flowered in her face likea light or a darkness she sought for some word that would coverthis up she reverted to the question of tea speaking as if theyshouldn t meet sooner then about five i count on you on him too however something had descended as to which thisexactly gave him his chance ah but i shall see you no hesaid coming nearer she had with her hand still on the knob her back against thedoor so that her retreat under his approach must be less than astep and yet she couldn t for her life with the other hand have pushed him away he was so near now that she could touchhim taste him smell him kiss him hold him he almost pressedupon her and the warmth of his face frowning smiling shemightn t know which only beautiful and strange was bent uponher with the largeness with which objects loom in dreams sheclosed her eyes to it and so the next instant against herpurpose she had put out her hand which had met his own andwhich he held then it was that from behind her closed eyes theright word came wait it was the word of his own distress andentreaty the word for both of them all they had left theirplank now on the great sea their hands were locked and thus shesaid it again wait wait she kept her eyes shut but herhand she knew helped her meaning which after a minute she wasaware his own had absorbed he let her go he turned away withthis message and when she saw him again his back was presented as he had left her and his face staring out of the window shehad saved herself and she got off xliilater on in the afternoon before the others arrived the formof their reunion was at least remarkable they might in theirgreat eastward drawing room have been comparing notes or nervesin apprehension of some stiff official visit maggie s mind inits restlessness even played a little with the prospect thehigh cool room with its afternoon shade with its old tapestriesuncovered with the perfect polish of its wide floor reflectingthe bowls of gathered flowers and the silver and linen of theprepared tea table drew from her a remark in which this wholeeffect was mirrored as well as something else in the prince smovement while he slowly paced and turned we re distinctlybourgeois she a trifle grimly threw off as an echo of theirold community though to a spectator sufficiently detached theymight have been quite the privileged pair they were reputed granted only they were taken as awaiting the visit of royalty they might have been ready on the word passed up in advance torepair together to the foot of the staircase the prince somewhatin front advancing indeed to the open doors and even going down for all his princedom to meet on the stopping of the chariot the august emergence the time was stale it was to be admitted for incidents of magnitude the september hush was in fullpossession at the end of the dull day and a couple of the longwindows stood open to the balcony that overhung the desolation the balcony from which maggie in the springtime had seenamerigo and charlotte look down together at the hour of herreturn from the regent s park near by with her father theprincipino and miss bogle amerigo now again in his punctualimpatience went out a couple of times and stood there afterwhich as to report that nothing was in sight he returned to theroom with frankly nothing else to do the princess pretended toread he looked at her as he passed there hovered in her ownsense the thought of other occasions when she had cheatedappearances of agitation with a book at last she felt himstanding before her and then she raised her eyes do you remember how this morning when you told me of thisevent i asked you if there were anything particular you wishedme to do you spoke of my being at home but that was a matter ofcourse you spoke of something else he went on while she satwith her book on her knee and her raised eyes something thatmakes me almost wish it may happen you spoke he said of thepossibility of my seeing her alone do you know if that comes he asked the use i shall make of it and then as she waited the use is all before me ah it s your own business now said his wife but it had madeher rise i shall make it my own he answered i shall tell her i liedto her ah no she returned and i shall tell her you did she shook her head again oh still less with which therefore they stood at difference he with his headerect and his happy idea perched in its eagerness on his crest and how then is she to know she isn t to know she s only still to think you don t and therefore that i m always a fool she may think saidmaggie what she likes think it without my protest the princess made a movement what business is it of yours isn t it my right to correct her maggie let his question ring ring long enough for him to hear ithimself only then she took it up correct her and it washer own now that really rang aren t you rather forgetting whoshe is after which while he quite stared for it as it was thevery first clear majesty he had known her to use she flung downher book and raised a warning hand the carriage come the come had matched for lucid firmness the rest of herspeech and when they were below in the hall there was a go for him through the open doors and between the ranged servants that matched even that he received royalty bareheaded therefore in the persons of mr and mrs verver as it alightedon the pavement and maggie was at the threshold to welcome it toher house later on upstairs again she even herself felt stillmore the force of the limit of which she had just reminded him at tea in charlotte s affirmed presence as charlotte affirmedit she drew a long breath of richer relief it was thestrangest once more of all impressions but what she most felt for the half hour was that mr and mrs verver were making theoccasion easy they were somehow conjoined in it conjoined for apresent effect as maggie had absolutely never yet seen them andthere occurred before long a moment in which amerigo s look mether own in recognitions that he couldn t suppress the questionof the amount of correction to which charlotte had laid herselfopen rose and hovered for the instant only to sink conspicuously by its own weight so high a pitch she seemed togive to the unconsciousness of questions so resplendent a showof serenity she succeeded in making the shade of the official in her beauty and security never for a moment dropped it was acool high refuge like the deep arched recess of some colouredand gilded image in which she sat and smiled and waited drankher tea referred to her husband and remembered her mission hermission had quite taken form it was but another name for theinterest of her great opportunity that of representing the artsand the graces to a people languishing afar off in ignorance maggie had sufficiently intimated to the prince ten minutesbefore that she needed no showing as to what their friendwouldn t consent to be taken for but the difficulty now indeedwas to choose for explicit tribute of admiration between thevarieties of her nobler aspects she carried it off to put thematter coarsely with a taste and a discretion that held ouryoung woman s attention for the first quarter of an hour to thevery point of diverting it from the attitude of her overshadowed her almost superseded companion but adam verver profited indeedat this time even with his daughter by his so markedpeculiarity of seeming on no occasion to have an attitude and solong as they were in the room together she felt him still simplyweave his web and play out his long fine cord knew herself inpresence of this tacit process very much as she had known herselfat fawns he had a way the dear man wherever he was of movingabout the room noiselessly to see what it might contain andhis manner of now resorting to this habit acquainted as healready was with the objects in view expressed with a certainsharpness the intention of leaving his wife to her devices itdid even more than this it signified to the apprehension of theprincess from the moment she more directly took thought of him almost a special view of these devices as actually exhibited intheir rarity together with an independent a settledappreciation of their general handsome adequacy which scarcelyrequired the accompaniment of his faint contemplative hum charlotte throned as who should say between her hostess and herhost the whole scene having crystallised as soon as she tookher place to the right quiet lustre the harmony was not lesssustained for being superficial and the only approach to a breakin it was while amerigo remained standing long enough for hisfather in law vaguely wondering to appeal to him invite oraddress him and then in default of any such word selected forpresentation to the other visitor a plate of petits fours maggiewatched her husband if it now could be called watching offerthis refreshment she noted the consummate way for consummate was the term she privately applied in which charlotte clearedher acceptance cleared her impersonal smile of any betrayal any slightest value of consciousness and then felt the slowsurge of a vision that at the end of another minute or two hadfloated her across the room to where her father stood looking ata picture an early florentine sacred subject that he had givenher on her marriage he might have been in silence taking hislast leave of it it was a work for which he entertained sheknew an unqualified esteem the tenderness represented for herby his sacrifice of such a treasure had become to her sense apart of the whole infusion of the immortal expression thebeauty of his sentiment looked out at her always from thebeauty of the rest as if the frame made positively a window forhis spiritual face she might have said to herself at thismoment that in leaving the thing behind him held as in herclasping arms he was doing the most possible toward leaving hera part of his palpable self she put her hand over his shoulder and their eyes were held again together by the abidingfelicity they smiled in emulation vaguely as if speech failedthem through their having passed too far she would have begun towonder the next minute if it were reserved to them for the laststage to find their contact like that of old friends reunitedtoo much on the theory of the unchanged subject to shy lapses it s all right eh oh my dear rather he had applied the question to the great fact of the picture asshe had spoken for the picture in reply but it was as if theirwords for an instant afterwards symbolised another truth so thatthey looked about at everything else to give them this extension she had passed her arm into his and the other objects in theroom the other pictures the sofas the chairs the tables thecabinets the important pieces supreme in their way stoodout round them consciously for recognition and applause theireyes moved together from piece to piece taking in the wholenobleness quite as if for him to measure the wisdom of oldideas the two noble persons seated in conversation at tea fell thus into the splendid effect and the general harmony mrs verver and the prince fairly placed themselves howeverunwittingly as high expressions of the kind of human furniturerequired esthetically by such a scene the fusion of theirpresence with the decorative elements their contribution to thetriumph of selection was complete and admirable though to alingering view a view more penetrating than the occasion reallydemanded they also might have figured as concrete attestationsof a rare power of purchase there was much indeed in the tone inwhich adam verver spoke again and who shall say where histhought stopped le compte y est you ve got some good things maggie met it afresh ah don t they look well theircompanions at the sound of this gave them in a spaciousintermission of slow talk an attention all of gravity that waslike an ampler submission to the general duty of magnificence sitting as still to be thus appraised as a pair of effigies ofthe contemporary great on one of the platforms of madame tussaud i m so glad for your last look with which after maggie quite in the air had said it the notewas struck indeed the note of that strange accepted finality ofrelation as from couple to couple which almost escaped anawkwardness only by not attempting a gloss yes this was thewonder that the occasion defied insistence precisely because ofthe vast quantities with which it dealt so that separation wason a scale beyond any compass of parting to do such an hourjustice would have been in some degree to question its grounds which was why they remained in fine the four of them in theupper air united in the firmest abstention from pressure therewas no point visibly at which face to face either amerigo orcharlotte had pressed and how little she herself was in dangerof doing so maggie scarce needed to remember that her fatherwouldn t by the tip of a toe of that she was equally conscious the only thing was that since he didn t she could but hold herbreath for what he would do instead when at the end of threeminutes more he had said with an effect of suddenness well mag and the principino it was quite as if that were bycontrast the hard the truer voice she glanced at the clock i ordered him for half past five which hasn t yet struck trust him my dear not to fail you oh i don t want him to fail me was mr verver s reply yetuttered in so explicitly jocose a relation to the possibilitiesof failure that even when just afterwards he wandered in hisimpatience to one of the long windows and passed out to thebalcony she asked herself but for a few seconds if reality should she follow him would overtake or meet her there shefollowed him of necessity it came absolutely so near to hisinviting her by stepping off into temporary detachment to givethe others something of the chance that she and her husband hadso fantastically discussed beside him then while they hung overthe great dull place clear and almost coloured now colouredwith the odd sad pictured old fashioned look that emptylondon streets take on in waning afternoons of the summer s end she felt once more how impossible such a passage would have beento them how it would have torn them to pieces if they had somuch as suffered its suppressed relations to peep out of theireyes this danger would doubtless indeed have been more to bereckoned with if the instinct of each she could certainly atleast answer for her own had not so successfully acted to trumpup other apparent connexions for it connexions as to which theycould pretend to be frank you mustn t stay on here you know adam verver said as aresult of his unobstructed outlook fawns is all there for you of course to the end of my tenure but fawns so dismantled headded with mild ruefulness fawns with half its contents andhalf its best things removed won t seem to you i m afraid particularly lively no maggie answered we should miss its best things its bestthings my dear have certainly been removed to be back there she went on to be back there and she paused for the forceof her idea oh to be back there without anything good but she didn thesitate now she brought her idea forth to be back therewithout charlotte is more than i think would do and as shesmiled at him with it so she saw him the next instant take it take it in a way that helped her smile to pass all for anallusion to what she didn t and couldn t say this quantity wastoo clear that she couldn t at such an hour be pretending toname to him what it was as he would have said going to be atfawns or anywhere else to want for him that was now and in amanner exaltedly sublimely out of their compass and theirquestion so that what was she doing while they waited for theprincipino while they left the others together and their tensionjust sensibly threatened what was she doing but just offer abold but substantial substitute nothing was stranger moreover under the action of charlotte s presence than the fact of a feltsincerity in her words she felt her sincerity absolutely sound she gave it for all it might mean because charlotte dear youknow she said is incomparable it took thirty seconds butshe was to know when these were over that she had pronounced oneof the happiest words of her life they had turned from the viewof the street they leaned together against the balcony rail with the room largely in sight from where they stood but withthe prince and mrs verver out of range nothing he could try she immediately saw was to keep his eyes from lighting not evenhis taking out his cigarette case and saying before he saidanything else may i smoke she met it for encouragement withher my dear again and then while he struck his match shehad just another minute to be nervous a minute that she made useof however not in the least to falter but to reiterate with ahigh ring a ring that might for all she cared reach the pairinside father father charlotte s great it was not till after he had begun to smoke that he looked ather charlotte s great they could close upon it such a basis as they might immediatelyfeel it make and so they stood together over it quitegratefully each recording to the other s eyes that it was firmunder their feet they had even thus a renewed wait as for proofof it much as if he were letting her see while the minuteslapsed for their concealed companions that this was finally justwhy but just why you see he presently added how right iwas right i mean to do it for you ah rather she murmured with her smile and then as to beherself ideally right i don t see what you would have donewithout her the point was he returned quietly that i didn t see what youwere to do yet it was a risk it was a risk said maggie but i believed in it at least formyself she smiled well now he smoked we see we see i know her better you know her best oh but naturally on which as the warranted truth of it hungin the air the truth warranted as who should say exactly bythe present opportunity to pronounce this opportunity createdand accepted she found herself lost though with a finer thrillthan she had perhaps yet known in the vision of all he mightmean the sense of it in her rose higher rose with each momentthat he invited her thus to see him linger and when after alittle more he had said smoking again and looking up with headthrown back and hands spread on the balcony rail at the grey gaunt front of the house she s beautiful beautiful hersensibility reported to her the shade of a new note it was allshe might have wished for it was with a kind of speakingcompetence the note of possession and control and yet itconveyed to her as nothing till now had done the reality of theirparting they were parting in the light of it absolutely oncharlotte s value the value that was filling the room out ofwhich they had stepped as if to give it play and with which theprince on his side was perhaps making larger acquaintance ifmaggie had desired at so late an hour some last conclusivecomfortable category to place him in for dismissal she mighthave found it here in its all coming back to his ability to restupon high values somehow when all was said and with the memoryof her gifts her variety her power so much remained ofcharlotte s what else had she herself meant three minutes beforeby speaking of her as great great for the world that was beforeher that he proposed she should be she was not to be wasted inthe application of his plan maggie held to this then that shewasn t to be wasted to let his daughter know it he had soughtthis brief privacy what a blessing accordingly that she couldspeak her joy in it his face meanwhile at all events wasturned to her and as she met his eyes again her joy wentstraight it s success father it s success and even this he added as the principino appearing alone deep within piped across an instant greeting even this isn t altogether failure they went in to receive the boy upon whose introduction to theroom by miss bogle charlotte and the prince got up seeminglywith an impressiveness that had caused miss bogle not to givefurther effect to her own entrance she had retired but theprincipino s presence by itself sufficiently broke thetension the subsidence of which in the great room ten minuteslater gave to the air something of the quality produced by thecessation of a sustained rattle stillness when the prince andprincess returned from attending the visitors to their carriage might have been said to be not so much restored as created sothat whatever next took place in it was foredoomed to remarkablesalience that would have been the case even with so natural though so futile a movement as maggie s going out to the balconyagain to follow with her eyes her father s departure thecarriage was out of sight it had taken her too long solemnly toreascend and she looked awhile only at the great grey space onwhich as on the room still more the shadow of dusk had fallen here at first her husband had not rejoined her he had come upwith the boy who clutching his hand abounded as usual inremarks worthy of the family archives but the two appeared thento have proceeded to report to miss bogle it meant something forthe princess that her husband had thus got their son out of theway not bringing him back to his mother but everything now asshe vaguely moved about struck her as meaning so much that theunheard chorus swelled yet this above all her just being thereas she was and waiting for him to come in their freedom to betogether there always was the meaning most disengaged she stoodin the cool twilight and took in all about her where it lurked her reason for what she had done she knew at last really why and how she had been inspired and guided how she had beenpersistently able how to her soul all the while it had beenfor the sake of this end here it was then the moment thegolden fruit that had shone from afar only what were thesethings in the fact for the hand and for the lips when tested when tasted what were they as a reward closer than she had everbeen to the measure of her course and the full face of her act she had an instant of the terror that when there has beensuspense always precedes on the part of the creature to bepaid the certification of the amount amerigo knew it theamount he still held it and the delay in his return making herheart beat too fast to go on was like a sudden blinding light ona wild speculation she had thrown the dice but his hand wasover her cast he opened the door however at last he hadn t been away tenminutes and then with her sight of him renewed to intensity she seemed to have a view of the number his presence alone ashe paused to look at her somehow made it the highest and evenbefore he had spoken she had begun to be paid in full with thatconsciousness in fact an extraordinary thing occurred theassurance of her safety so making her terror drop that already within the minute it had been changed to concern for his ownanxiety for everything that was deep in his being and everythingthat was fair in his face so far as seeing that she was paid went he might have been holding out the money bag for her tocome and take it but what instantly rose for her between theact and her acceptance was the sense that she must strike him aswaiting for a confession this in turn charged her with a newhorror if that was her proper payment she would go withoutmoney his acknowledgment hung there too monstrously at theexpense of charlotte before whose mastery of the greater styleshe had just been standing dazzled all she now knew accordingly was that she should be ashamed to listen to theuttered word all that is but that she might dispose of it onthe spot forever isn t she too splendid she simply said offering it to explainand to finish oh splendid with which he came over to her that s our help you see she added to point further hermoral it kept him before her therefore taking in or trying to whatshe so wonderfully gave he tried too clearly to please her tomeet her in her own way but with the result only that close toher her face kept before him his hands holding her shoulders his whole act enclosing her he presently echoed see i seenothing but you and the truth of it had with this force aftera moment so strangely lighted his eyes that as for pity anddread of them she buried her own in his breast glassesby henry jameschapter iyes indeed i say to myself pen in hand i can keep hold of thethread and let it lead me back to the first impression the littlestory is all there i can touch it from point to point for thethread as i call it is a row of coloured beads on a string noneof the beads are missing at least i think they re not that sexactly what i shall amuse myself with finding out i had been all summer working hard in town and then had gone downto folkestone for a blow art was long i felt and my holidayshort my mother was settled at folkestone and i paid her a visitwhen i could i remember how on this occasion after weeks in mystuffy studio with my nose on my palette i sniffed up the cleansalt air and cooled my eyes with the purple sea the place wasfull of lodgings and the lodgings were at that season full ofpeople people who had nothing to do but to stare at one another onthe great flat down there were thousands of little chairs andalmost as many little jews and there was music in an open rotunda over which the little jews wagged their big noses we all strolledto and fro and took pennyworths of rest the long level cliff top edged in places with its iron rail might have been the deck of ahuge crowded ship there were old folks in bath chairs and therewas one dear chair creeping to its last full stop by the side ofwhich i always walked there was in fine weather the coast offrance to look at and there were the usual things to say about it there was also in every state of the atmosphere our friend mrs meldrum a subject of remark not less inveterate the widow of anofficer in the engineers she had settled like many members of themartial miscellany well within sight of the hereditary enemy whohowever had left her leisure to form in spite of the difference oftheir years a close alliance with my mother she was theheartiest the keenest the ugliest of women the least apologetic the least morbid in her misfortune she carried it high aloft withloud sounds and free gestures made it flutter in the breeze as ifit had been the flag of her country it consisted mainly of a bigred face indescribably out of drawing from which she glared atyou through gold rimmed aids to vision optic circles of suchdiameter and so frequently displaced that some one had vividlyspoken of her as flattering her nose against the glass of herspectacles she was extraordinarily near sighted and whateverthey did to other objects they magnified immensely the kind eyesbehind them blest conveniences they were in their hideous honest strength they showed the good lady everything in the worldbut her own queerness this element was enhanced by wild braveriesof dress reckless charges of colour and stubborn resistances ofcut wondrous encounters in which the art of the toilet seemed tolay down its life she had the tread of a grenadier and the voiceof an angel in the course of a walk with her the day after my arrival i foundmyself grabbing her arm with sudden and undue familiarity i hadbeen struck by the beauty of a face that approached us and i wasstill more affected when i saw the face at the sight of mycompanion open like a window thrown wide a smile fluttered outof it an brightly as a drapery dropped from a sill a draperyshaken there in the sun by a young lady flanked by two young men awonderful young lady who as we drew nearer rushed up to mrs meldrum with arms flourished for an embrace my immediateimpression of her had been that she was dressed in mourning butduring the few moments she stood talking with our friend i mademore discoveries the figure from the neck down was meagre thestature insignificant but the desire to please towered high aswell as the air of infallibly knowing how and of never nevermissing it this was a little person whom i would have made a highbid for a good chance to paint the head the features thecolour the whole facial oval and radiance had a wonderful purity the deep grey eyes the most agreeable i thought that i had everseen brushed with a kind of winglike grace every object theyencountered their possessor was just back from boulogne whereshe had spent a week with dear mrs floyd taylor this accountedfor the effusiveness of her reunion with dear mrs meldrum herblack garments were of the freshest and daintiest she suggested apink and white wreath at a showy funeral she confounded us forthree minutes with her presence she was a beauty of the greatconscious public responsible order the young men her companions gazed at her and grinned i could see there were very few momentsof the day at which young men these or others would not be sooccupied the people who approached took leave of their manners every one seemed to linger and gape when she brought her faceclose to mrs meldrum s and she appeared to be always bringing itclose to somebody s it was a marvel that objects so dissimilarshould express the same general identity the unmistakablecharacter of the english gentlewoman mrs meldrum sustained thecomparison with her usual courage but i wondered why she didn tintroduce me i should have had no objection to the bringing ofsuch a face close to mine however by the time the young ladymoved on with her escort she herself bequeathed me a sense thatsome such rapprochement might still occur was this by reason ofthe general frequency of encounters at folkestone or by reason ofa subtle acknowledgment that she contrived to make of the rights on the part of others that such beauty as hers created i was ina position to answer that question after mrs meldrum had answereda few of mine chapter iiflora saunt the only daughter of an old soldier had lost both herparents her mother within a few months mrs meldrum had knownthem disapproved of them considerably avoided them she hadwatched the girl off and on from her early childhood flora just twenty was extraordinarily alone in the world so alone thatshe had no natural chaperon no one to stay with but a mercenarystranger mrs hammond synge the sister in law of one of the youngmen i had just seen she had lots of friends but none of themnice she kept picking up impossible people the floyd taylors with whom she had been at boulogne were simply horrid thehammond synges were perhaps not so vulgar but they had noconscience in their dealings with her she knows what i think of them said mrs meldrum and indeedshe knows what i think of most things she shares that privilege with most of your friends i repliedlaughing no doubt but possibly to some of my friends it makes a littledifference that girl doesn t care a button she knows best ofall what i think of flora saunt and what may your opinion be why that she s not worth troubling about an idiot too abysmal doesn t she care for that just enough as you saw to hug me till i cry out she s toopleased with herself for anything else to matter surely my dear friend i rejoined she has a good deal to bepleased with so every one tells her and so you would have told her if i hadgiven you the chance however that doesn t signify either forher vanity is beyond all making or mending she believes inherself and she s welcome after all poor dear having onlyherself to look to i ve seldom met a young woman more completelyfree to be silly she has a clear course she ll make a showyfinish well i replied as she probably will reduce many persons to thesame degraded state her partaking of it won t stand out so much if you mean that the world s full of twaddlers i quite agree withyou cried mrs meldrum trumpeting her laugh half across thechannel i had after this to consider a little what she would call mymother s son but i didn t let it prevent me from insisting on hermaking me acquainted with flora saunt indeed i took the bull bythe horns urging that she had drawn the portrait of a nature whichcommon charity now demanded of her to put into relation with acharacter really fine such a frail creature was just an object ofpity this contention on my part had at first of course beenjocular but strange to say it was quite the ground i found myselftaking with regard to our young lady after i had begun to know her i couldn t have said what i felt about her except that she wasundefended from the first of my sitting with her there afterdinner under the stars that was a week at folkestone of balmynights and muffled tides and crowded chairs i became aware boththat protection was wholly absent from her life and that she waswholly indifferent to its absence the odd thing was that she wasnot appealing she was abjectly divinely conceited absurdlyfantastically pleased her beauty was as yet all the world to her a world she had plenty to do to live in mrs meldrum told me moreabout her and there was nothing that as the centre of a group ofgiggling nudging spectators flora wasn t ready to tell aboutherself she held her little court in the crowd upon the grass playing her light over jews and gentiles completely at ease in allpromiscuities it was an effect of these things that from the veryfirst with every one listening i could mention that my mainbusiness with her would be just to have a go at her head and toarrange in that view for an early sitting it would have been asimpossible i think to be impertinent to her as it would have beento throw a stone at a plate glass window so any talk that wentforward on the basis of her loveliness was the most natural thingin the world and immediately became the most general and sociable it was when i saw all this that i judged how though it was thelast thing she asked for what one would ever most have at herservice was a curious compassion that sentiment was coloured bythe vision of the dire exposure of a being whom vanity had put sooff her guard hers was the only vanity i have ever known thatmade its possessor superlatively soft mrs meldrum s furtherinformation contributed moreover to these indulgences her accountof the girl s neglected childhood and queer continentalrelegations with straying squabbling monte carlo haunting parents the more invidious picture above all of her pecuniaryarrangement still in force with the hammond synges who really though they never took her out practically she went out alone hadtheir hands half the time in her pocket she had to pay foreverything down to her share of the wine bills and the horses fodder down to bertie hammond synge s fare in the underground when he went to the city for her she had been left with justmoney enough to turn her head and it hadn t even been put intrust nothing prudent or proper had been done with it she couldspend her capital and at the rate she was going expensive extravagant and with a swarm of parasites to help it certainlywouldn t last very long couldn t you perhaps take her independent unencumbered as youare i asked of mrs meldrum you re probably with oneexception the sanest person she knows and you at least wouldn tscandalously fleece her how do you know what i wouldn t do my humorous friend demanded of course i ve thought how i can help her it has kept me awake atnight but doing it s impossible she ll take nothing from me you know what she does she hugs me and runs away she has aninstinct about me and feels that i ve one about her and then shedislikes me for another reason that i m not quite clear about butthat i m well aware of and that i shall find out some day so faras her settling with me goes it would be impossible moreover here she wants naturally enough a much wider field she must live inlondon her game is there so she takes the line of adoring me ofsaying she can never forget that i was devoted to her mother whichi wouldn t for the world have been and of giving me a wide berth i think she positively dislikes to look at me it s all right there s no obligation though people in general can t take theireyes off me i see that at this moment i replied but what does it matterwhere or how for the present she lives she ll marry infallibly marry early and everything then will change whom will she marry my companion gloomily asked any one she likes she s so abnormally pretty that she can doanything she ll fascinate some nabob or some prince she ll fascinate him first and bore him afterwards moreovershe s not so pretty as you make her out she hasn t a scrap of afigure no doubt but one doesn t in the least miss it not now said mrs meldrum but one will when she s older andwhen everything will have to count when she s older she ll count as a princess so it won t matter she has other drawbacks my companion went on those wonderfuleyes are good for nothing but to roll about like sugar balls whichthey greatly resemble in a child s mouth she can t use them use them why she does nothing else to make fools of young men but not to read or write not to doany sort of work she never opens a book and her maid writes hernotes you ll say that those who live in glass houses shouldn tthrow stones of course i know that if i didn t wear my goggles ishouldn t be good for much do you mean that miss saunt ought to sport such things iexclaimed with more horror than i meant to show i don t prescribe for her i don t know that they re what sherequires what s the matter with her eyes i asked after a moment i don t exactly know but i heard from her mother years ago thateven as a child they had had for a while to put her into spectaclesand that though she hated them and had been in a fury of disgust she would always have to be extremely careful i m sure i hope sheis i echoed the hope but i remember well the impression this madeupon me my immediate pang of resentment a disgust almost equal toflora s own i felt as if a great rare sapphire had split in myhand chapter iiithis conversation occurred the night before i went back to town isettled on the morrow to take a late train so that i had still mymorning to spend at folkestone where during the greater part of iti was out with my mother every one in the place was as usual outwith some one else and even had i been free to go and take leaveof her i should have been sure that flora saunt would not be athome just where she was i presently discovered she was at thefar end of the cliff the point at which it overhangs the prettyview of sandgate and hythe her back however was turned to thisattraction it rested with the aid of her elbows thrust slightlybehind her so that her scanty little shoulders were raised towardher ears on the high rail that inclosed the down two gentlemenstood before her whose faces we couldn t see but who even asobserved from the rear were visibly absorbed in the charmingfigure piece submitted to them i was freshly struck with the factthat this meagre and defective little person with the cock of herhat and the flutter of her crape with her eternal idleness hereternal happiness her absence of moods and mysteries and thepretty presentation of her feet which especially now in thesupported slope of her posture occupied with their imperceptibilityso much of the foreground i was reminded anew i say how ouryoung lady dazzled by some art that the enumeration of her meritsdidn t explain and that the mention of her lapses didn t affect where she was amiss nothing counted and where she was righteverything did i say she was wanting in mystery but that afterall was her secret this happened to be my first chance ofintroducing her to my mother who had not much left in life but thequiet look from under the hood of her chair at the things which when she should have quitted those she loved she could still trustto make the world good for them i wondered an instant how muchshe might be moved to trust flora saunt and then while the chairstood still and she waited i went over and asked the girl to comeand speak to her in this way i saw that if one of flora sattendants was the inevitable young hammond synge master ofceremonies of her regular court always offering the use of atelescope and accepting that of a cigar the other was a personagei had not yet encountered a small pale youth in showyknickerbockers whose eyebrows and nose and the glued points ofwhose little moustache were extraordinarily uplifted and sustained i remember taking him at first for a foreigner and for something ofa pretender i scarce know why unless because of the motive i feltin the stare he fixed on me when i asked miss saunt to come away he struck me a little as a young man practising the social art ofimpertinence but it didn t matter for flora came away withalacrity bringing all her prettiness and pleasure and gliding overthe grass in that rustle of delicate mourning which made theendless variety of her garments as a painter could take heed strike one always as the same obscure elegance she seated herselfon the floor of my mother s chair a little too much on her rightinstep as i afterwards gathered caressing her still hand smilingup into her cold face commending and approving her without areserve and without a doubt she told her immediately as if itwere something for her to hold on by that she was soon to sit tome for a likeness and these words gave me a chance to enquire ifit would be the fate of the picture should i finish it to bepresented to the young man in the knickerbockers her lips atthis parted in a stare her eyes darkened to the purple of one ofthe shadow patches on the sea she showed for the passing instantthe face of some splendid tragic mask and i remembered for theinconsequence of it what mrs meldrum had said about her sight ihad derived from this lady a worrying impulse to catechise her butthat didn t seem exactly kind so i substituted another question inquiring who the pretty young man in knickerbockers might happento be oh a gentleman i met at boulogne he has come over to see me after a moment she added lord iffield i had never heard of lord iffield but her mention of his havingbeen at boulogne helped me to give him a niche mrs meldrum hadincidentally thrown a certain light on the manners of mrs floyd taylor flora s recent hostess in that charming town a lady who it appeared had a special vocation for helping rich young men tofind a use for their leisure she had always one or other in handand had apparently on this occasion pointed her lesson at the rarecreature on the opposite coast i had a vague idea that boulognewas not a resort of the world s envied at the same time theremight very well have been a strong attraction there even for one ofthe darlings of fortune i could perfectly understand in any casethat such a darling should be drawn to folkestone by flora saunt but it was not in truth of these things i was thinking what wasuppermost in my mind was a matter which though it had no sort ofkeeping insisted just then on coming out is it true miss saunt i suddenly demanded that you re sounfortunate as to have had some warning about your beautiful eyes i was startled by the effect of my words the girl threw back herhead changing colour from brow to chin true who in the worldsays so i repented of my question in a flash the way she met itmade it seem cruel and i felt my mother look at me in somesurprise i took care in answer to flora s challenge not toincriminate mrs meldrum i answered that the rumour had reachedme only in the vaguest form and that if i had been moved to put itto the test my very real interest in her must be held responsible her blush died away but a pair of still prettier tears glistenedin its track if you ever hear such a thing said again you cansay it s a horrid lie i had brought on a commotion deeper thanany i was prepared for but it was explained in some degree by thenext words she uttered i m happy to say there s nothing thematter with any part of me whatever not the least little thing she spoke with her habitual complacency with triumphant assurance she smiled again and i could see how she wished that she hadn t sotaken me up she turned it off with a laugh i ve good eyes good teeth a good digestion and a good temper i m sound of windand limb nothing could have been more characteristic than herblush and her tears nothing less acceptable to her than to bethought not perfect in every particular she couldn t submit tothe imputation of a flaw i expressed my delight in what she toldme assuring her i should always do battle for her and as if torejoin her companions she got up from her place on my mother stoes the young men presented their backs to us they were leaningon the rail of the cliff our incident had produced a certainawkwardness and while i was thinking of what next to say sheexclaimed irrelevantly don t you know he ll be lordconsidine at that moment the youth marked for this high destinyturned round and she spoke to my mother i ll introduce him toyou he s awfully nice she beckoned and invited him with herparasol the movement struck me as taking everything for granted i had heard of lord considine and if i had not been able to placelord iffield it was because i didn t know the name of his eldestson the young man took no notice of miss saunt s appeal he onlystared a moment and then on her repeating it quietly turned hisback she was an odd creature she didn t blush at this she onlysaid to my mother apologetically but with the frankest sweetestamusement you don t mind do you he s a monster of shyness it was as if she were sorry for every one for lord iffield thevictim of a complaint so painful and for my mother the subject ofa certain slight i m sure i don t want him said my mother butflora added some promise of how she would handle him for hisrudeness she would clearly never explain anything by any failureof her own appeal there rolled over me while she took leave of usand floated back to her friends a wave of superstitious dread iseemed somehow to see her go forth to her fate and yet what shouldfill out this orb of a high destiny if not such beauty and suchjoy i had a dim idea that lord considine was a great proprietor and though there mingled with it a faint impression that ishouldn t like his son the result of the two images was a whimsicalprayer that the girl mightn t miss her possible fortune chapter ivone day in the course of the following june there was ushered intomy studio a gentleman whom i had not yet seen but with whom i hadbeen very briefly in correspondence a letter from him hadexpressed to me some days before his regret on learning that my splendid portrait of miss flora louisa saunt whose full namefigured by her own wish in the catalogue of the exhibition of theacademy had found a purchaser before the close of the privateview he took the liberty of inquiring whether i might have at hisservice some other memorial of the same lovely head somepreliminary sketch some study for the picture i had replied thati had indeed painted miss saunt more than once and that if he wereinterested in my work i should be happy to show him what i haddone mr geoffrey dawling the person thus introduced to me stumbled into my room with awkward movements and equivocal sounds a long lean confused confusing young man with a bad complexionand large protrusive teeth he bore in its most indelible pressurethe postmark as it were of oxford and as soon as he opened hismouth i perceived in addition to a remarkable revelation of gums that the text of the queer communication matched the registeredenvelope he was full of refinements and angles of dreary anddistinguished knowledge of his unconscious drollery his dressfreely partook it seemed from the gold ring into which his rednecktie was passed to the square toe caps of his boots to conformwith a high sense of modernness to the fashion before the last there were moments when his overdone urbanity all suggestivestammers and interrogative quavers made him scarcely intelligible but i felt him to be a gentleman and i liked the honesty of hiserrand and the expression of his good green eyes as a worshipper at the shrine of beauty however he neededexplaining especially when i found he had no acquaintance with mybrilliant model had on the mere evidence of my picture taken ashe said a tremendous fancy to her looks i ought doubtless tohave been humiliated by the simplicity of his judgment of them ajudgment for which the rendering was lost in the subject quiteleaving out the element of art he was like the innocent readerfor whom the story is really true and the author a negligiblequantity he had come to me only because he wanted to purchase and i remember being so amused at his attitude which i had neverseen equally marked in a person of education that i asked him why for the sort of enjoyment he desired it wouldn t be more to thepoint to deal directly with the lady he stared and blushed atthis the idea clearly alarmed him he was an extraordinary case personally so modest that i could see it had never occurred to him he had fallen in love with a painted sign and seemed content justto dream of what it stood for he was the young prince in thelegend or the comedy who loses his heart to the miniature of theprincess beyond seas until i knew him better this puzzled memuch the link was so missing between his sensibility and his type he was of course bewildered by my sketches which implied in thebeholder some sense of intention and quality but for one of them a comparative failure he ended by conceiving a preference soarbitrary and so lively that taking no second look at the others he expressed his wish to possess it and fell into the extremity ofconfusion over the question of price i helped him over thatstile and he went off without having asked me a direct questionabout miss saunt yet with his acquisition under his arm hisdelicacy was such that he evidently considered his rights to belimited he had acquired none at all in regard to the original ofthe picture there were others for i was curious about him thati wanted him to feel i conceded i should have been glad of hiscarrying away a sense of ground acquired for coming back toensure this i had probably only to invite him and i perfectlyrecall the impulse that made me forbear it operated suddenly fromwithin while he hung about the door and in spite of the diffidentappeal that blinked in his gentle grin if he was smitten withflora s ghost what mightn t be the direct force of the luminarythat could cast such a shadow this source of radiance floodingmy poor place might very well happen to be present the next timehe should turn up the idea was sharp within me that there wererelations and complications it was no mission of mine to bringabout if they were to develop they should develop in their veryown sense let me say at once that they did develop and that i perhaps afterall had something to do with it if mr dawling had departedwithout a fresh appointment he was to reappear six months laterunder protection no less powerful than that of our young ladyherself i had seen her repeatedly for months she had grown toregard my studio as the temple of her beauty this miracle wasrecorded and celebrated there as nowhere else in other placesthere was occasional reference to other subjects of remark thedegree of her presumption continued to be stupefying there wasnothing so extraordinary save the degree in which she never paidfor it she was kept innocent that is she was kept safe by heregotism but she was helped also though she had now put off hermourning by the attitude of the lone orphan who had to be a lawunto herself it was as a lone orphan that she came and went as alone orphan that she was the centre of a crush the neglect of thehammond synges gave relief to this character and she made it worththeir while to be as every one said too shocking lord iffieldhad gone to india to shoot tigers but he returned in time for thepunctual private view it was he who had snapped up as floracalled it the gem of the exhibition my hope for the girl sfuture had slipped ignominiously off his back but after hispurchase of the portrait i tried to cultivate a new faith thegirl s own faith was wonderful it couldn t however be contagious too great was the limit of her sense of what painters call values her colours were laid on like blankets on a cold night how indeedcould a person speak the truth who was always posturing andbragging she was after all vulgar enough and by the time i hadmastered her profile and could almost with my eyes shut do it in asingle line i was decidedly tired of its purity which affectedme at last as inane one moved with her moreover among phenomenamismated and unrelated nothing in her talk ever matched anythingout of it lord iffield was dying of love for her but his familywas leading him a life his mother horrid woman had told someone that she would rather he should be swallowed by a tiger thanmarry a girl not absolutely one of themselves he had given hisyoung friend unmistakable signs but was lying low gaining time it was in his father s power to be both in personal and inpecuniary ways excessively nasty to him his father wouldn t lastfor ever quite the contrary and he knew how thoroughly in spiteof her youth her beauty and the swarm of her admirers some ofthem positively threatening in their passion he could trust her tohold out there were richer cleverer men there were greaterpersonages too but she liked her little viscount just as he was and liked to think that bullied and persecuted he had her thereso gratefully to rest upon she came back to me with tale upontale and it all might be or mightn t i never met my pretty modelin the world she moved it appeared in exalted circles and couldonly admire in her wealth of illustration the grandeur of herlife and the freedom of her hand i had on the first opportunity spoken to her of geoffrey dawling and she had listened to my story so far as she had the art of suchpatience asking me indeed more questions about him than i couldanswer then she had capped my anecdote with others much morestriking the disclosure of effects produced in the mostextraordinary quarters on people who had followed her intorailway carriages guards and porters even who had literally stuckthere others who had spoken to her in shops and hung about herhouse door cabmen upon her honour in london who to gaze theirfill at her had found excuses to thrust their petrifaction throughthe very glasses of four wheelers she lost herself in thesereminiscences the moral of which was that poor mr dawling wasonly one of a million when therefore the next autumn sheflourished into my studio with her odd companion at her heels herfirst care was to make clear to me that if he was now in servitudeit wasn t because she had run after him dawling explained with ahundred grins that when one wished very much to get anything oneusually ended by doing so a proposition which led me wholly todissent and our young lady to asseverate that she hadn t in theleast wished to get mr dawling she mightn t have wished to gethim but she wished to show him and i seemed to read that if shecould treat him as a trophy her affairs were rather at the ebb true there always hung from her belt a promiscuous fringe ofscalps much at any rate would have come and gone since ourseparation in july she had spent four months abroad where onswiss and italian lakes in german cities in the french capital many accidents might have happened chapter vi had been again with my mother but except mrs meldrum and thegleam of france had not found at folkestone my old resources andpastimes mrs meldrum much edified by my report of theperformances as she called them in my studio had told me that toher knowledge flora would soon be on the straw she had cut fromher capital such fine fat slices that there was almost nothing moreleft to swallow perched on her breezy cliff the good lady dazzledme as usual by her universal light she knew so much more abouteverything and everybody than i could ever squeeze out of mycolour tubes she knew that flora was acting on system andabsolutely declined to be interfered with her precious reasoningwas that her money would last as long as she should need it that amagnificent marriage would crown her charms before she should bereally pinched she had a sum put by for a liberal outfit meanwhile the proper use of the rest was to decorate her for theapproaches to the altar keep her afloat in the society in whichshe would most naturally meet her match lord iffield had beenseen with her at lucerne at cadenabbia but it was mrs meldrum sconviction that nothing was to be expected of him but the mostfutile flirtation the girl had a certain hold of him but with agreat deal of swagger he hadn t the spirit of a sheep he was infear of his father and would never commit himself in lordconsidine s lifetime the most flora might achieve was that hewouldn t marry some one else geoffrey dawling to mrs meldrum sknowledge i had told her of the young man s visit had attachedhimself on the way back from italy to the hammond synge group myinformant was in a position to be definite about this dangler sheknew about his people she had heard of him before hadn t he beena friend of one of her nephews at oxford hadn t he spent thechristmas holidays precisely three years before at her brother in law s in yorkshire taking that occasion to get himself refusedwith derision by wilful betty the second daughter of the house her sister who liked the floundering youth had written to her tocomplain of betty and that the young man should now turn up as anappendage of flora s was one of those oft cited proofs that theworld is small and that there are not enough people to go round his father had been something or other in the treasury hisgrandfather on the mother s side had been something or other in thechurch he had come into the paternal estate two or threethousand a year in hampshire but he had let the placeadvantageously and was generous to four plain sisters who lived atbournemouth and adored him the family was hideous all round butthe very salt of the earth he was supposed to be unspeakablyclever he was fond of london fond of books of intellectualsociety and of the idea of a political career that such a manshould be at the same time fond of flora saunt attested as thephrase in the first volume of gibbon has it the variety of hisinclinations i was soon to learn that he was fonder of her thanof all the other things together betty one of five and withviews above her station was at any rate felt at home to havedished herself by her perversity of course no one had looked ather since and no one would ever look at her again it would beeminently desirable that flora should learn the lesson of betty sfate i was not struck i confess with all this in my mind by anysymptom on our young lady s part of that sort of meditation theone moral she saw in anything was that of her incomparable aspect which mr dawling smitten even like the railway porters and thecabmen by the doom dealing gods had followed from london to veniceand from venice back to london again i afterwards learned thather version of this episode was profusely inexact his personalacquaintance with her had been determined by an accident remarkableenough i admit in connexion with what had gone before acoincidence at all events superficially striking at munich returning from a tour in the tyrol with two of his sisters he hadfound himself at the table d hote of his inn opposite to the fullpresentment of that face of which the mere clumsy copy had made himdream and desire he had been tossed by it to a height sovertiginous as to involve a retreat from the board but the nextday he had dropped with a resounding thud at the very feet of hisapparition on the following with an equal incoherence asacrifice even of his bewildered sisters whom he left behind hemade an heroic effort to escape by flight from a fate of which hehad already felt the cold breath that fate in london verylittle later drove him straight before it drove him one sundayafternoon in the rain to the door of the hammond synges hemarched in other words close up to the cannon that was to blow himto pieces but three weeks when he reappeared to me had elapsedsince then yet to vary my metaphor the burden he was to carryfor the rest of his days was firmly lashed to his back i don tmean by this that flora had been persuaded to contract her scope imean that he had been treated to the unconditional snub which asthe event was to show couldn t have been bettered as a means ofsecuring him she hadn t calculated but she had said never andthat word had made a bed big enough for his long legged patience he became from this moment to my mind the interesting figure in thepiece now that he had acted without my aid i was free to show him this and having on his own side something to show me he repeatedlyknocked at my door what he brought with him on these occasionswas a simplicity so huge that as i turn my ear to the past i seemeven now to hear it bumping up and down my stairs that was reallywhat i saw of him in the light of his behaviour he had fallen inlove as he might have broken his leg and the fracture was of asort that would make him permanently lame it was the whole manwho limped and lurched with nothing of him left in the sameposition as before the tremendous cleverness the literarysociety the political ambition the bournemouth sisters all seemedto flop with his every movement a little nearer to the floor ihadn t had an oxford training and i had never encountered the greatman at whose feet poor dawling had most submissively sat and whohad addressed him his most destructive sniffs but i rememberasking myself how effectively this privilege had supposed itself toprepare him for the career on which my friend appeared now to haveembarked i remember too making up my mind about the cleverness which had its uses and i suppose in impenetrable shades even itscritics but from which the friction of mere personal intercoursewas not the sort of process to extract a revealing spark heaccepted without a question both his fever and his chill and theonly thing he touched with judgment was this convenience of myfriendship he doubtless told me his simple story but the mattercomes back in a kind of sense of my being rather the mouthpiece ofmy having had to put it together for him he took it from me inthis form without a groan and i gave it him quite as it came hetook it again and again spending his odd half hours with me as iffor the very purpose of learning how idiotically he was in love he told me i made him see things to begin with hadn t i firstmade him see flora saunt i wanted him to give her up and lucidlyinformed him why on which he never protested nor contradicted never was even so alembicated as to declare just for the sake ofthe point that he wouldn t he simply and pointlessly didn t andwhen at the end of three months i asked him what was the use oftalking with such a fellow his nearest approach to a justificationwas to say that what made him want to help her was just thedeficiencies i dwelt on i could only reply without grossdevelopments oh if you re as sorry for her as that i too wasnearly as sorry for her as that but it only led me to be sorrierstill for other victims of this compassion with dawling as withme the compassion was at first in excess of any visible motive sothat when eventually the motive was supplied each could to acertain extent compliment the other on the fineness of hisforesight after he had begun to haunt my studio miss saunt quite gave it up and i finally learned that she accused me of conspiring with him toput pressure on her to marry him she didn t know i would take itthat way else she would never have brought him to see me it wasin her view a part of the conspiracy that to show him a kindness iasked him at last to sit to me i dare say moreover she wasdisgusted to hear that i had ended by attempting almost as manysketches of his beauty as i had attempted of hers what was thevalue of tributes to beauty by a hand that could so abase itself my relation to poor dawling s want of modelling was simple enough i was really digging in that sandy desert for the buried treasureof his soul chapter viit befell at this period just before christmas that on my havinggone under pressure of the season into a great shop to buy a toy ortwo my eyes fleeing from superfluity lighted at a distance on thebright concretion of flora saunt an exhibitability that held itsown even against the most plausible pinkness of the most developeddolls a huge quarter of the place the biggest bazaar on earth was peopled with these and other effigies and fantasies as well aswith purchasers and vendors haggard alike in the blaze of the gas with hesitations i was just about to appeal to flora to avertthat stage of my errand when i saw that she was accompanied by agentleman whose identity though more than a year had elapsed cameback to me from the folkestone cliff it had been associated onthat scene with showy knickerbockers at present it overflowed moresplendidly into a fur trimmed overcoat lord iffield s presencemade me waver an instant before crossing over and during thatinstant flora blank and undistinguishing as if she too were afterall weary of alternatives looked straight across at me i was onthe point of raising my hat to her when i observed that her facegave no sign i was exactly in the line of her vision but sheeither didn t see me or didn t recognise me or else had a reasonto pretend she didn t was her reason that i had displeased herand that she wished to punish me i had always thought it one ofher merits that she wasn t vindictive she at any rate simplylooked away and at this moment one of the shop girls who hadapparently gone off in search of it bustled up to her with a smallmechanical toy it so happened that i followed closely what thentook place afterwards recognising that i had been led to do so led even through the crowd to press nearer for the purpose by animpression of which in the act i was not fully conscious flora with the toy in her hand looked round at her companion thenseeing his attention had been solicited in another quarter shemoved away with the shop girl who had evidently offered to conducther into the presence of more objects of the same sort when shereached the indicated spot i was in a position still to observeher she had asked some question about the working of the toy andthe girl taking it herself began to explain the little secret flora bent her head over it but she clearly didn t understand isaw her in a manner that quickened my curiosity give a glanceback at the place from which she had come lord iffield wastalking with another young person she satisfied herself of this bythe aid of a question addressed to her own attendant she thendrew closer to the table near which she stood and turning her backto me bent her head lower over the collection of toys and moreparticularly over the small object the girl had attempted toexplain she took it again and after a moment with her face wellaverted made an odd motion of her arms and a significant littleduck of her head these slight signs singular as it may appear produced in my bosom an agitation so great that i failed to noticelord iffield s whereabouts he had rejoined her he was close uponher before i knew it or before she knew it herself i felt at thatinstant the strangest of all promptings if it could have operatedmore rapidly it would have caused me to dash between them in somesuch manner as to give flora a caution in fact as it was i thinki could have done this in time had i not been checked by acuriosity stronger still than my impulse there were three secondsduring which i saw the young man and yet let him come on didn t imake the quick calculation that if he didn t catch what flora wasdoing i too might perhaps not catch it she at any rate herselftook the alarm on perceiving her companion s nearness she made still averted another duck of her head and a shuffle of her handsso precipitate that a little tin steamboat she had been holdingescaped from them and rattled down to the floor with a sharpnessthat i hear at this hour lord iffield had already seized her arm with a violent jerk he brought her round toward him then it wasthat there met my eyes a quite distressing sight this exquisitecreature blushing glaring exposed with a pair of big black rimmed eye glasses defacing her by their position crookedlyastride of her beautiful nose she made a grab at them with herfree hand while i turned confusedly away chapter viii don t remember how soon it was i spoke to geoffrey dawling hissittings were irregular but it was certainly the very next time hegave me one has any rumour ever reached you of miss saunt s having anythingthe matter with her eyes he stared with a candour that was asufficient answer to my question backing it up with a shocked andmystified never then i asked him if he had observed in her anysymptom however disguised of embarrassed sight on which after amoment s thought he exclaimed disguised as if my use of thatword had vaguely awakened a train she s not a bit myopic hesaid she doesn t blink or contract her lids i fully recognisedthis and i mentioned that she altogether denied the impeachment owing it to him moreover to explain the ground of my inquiry igave him a sketch of the incident that had taken place before me atthe shop he knew all about lord iffield that nobleman hadfigured freely in our conversation as his preferred his injuriousrival poor dawling s contention was that if there had been adefinite engagement between his lordship and the young lady thesort of thing that was announced in the morning post renunciationand retirement would be comparatively easy to him but that havingwaited in vain for any such assurance he was entitled to act as ifthe door were not really closed or were at any rate not cruellylocked he was naturally much struck with my anecdote and stillmore with my interpretation of it there is something there is something possibly something verygrave certainly something that requires she should make use ofartificial aids she won t admit it publicly because with heridolatry of her beauty the feeling she is all made up of she seesin such aids nothing but the humiliation and the disfigurement she has used them in secret but that is evidently not enough forthe affection she suffers from apparently some definite menace has lately grown much worse she looked straight at me in theshop which was violently lighted without seeing it was i at thesame distance at folkestone where as you know i first met her where i heard this mystery hinted at and where she indignantlydenied the thing she appeared easily enough to recognise people at present she couldn t really make out anything the shop girlshowed her she has successfully concealed from the man i saw herwith that she resorts in private to a pince nez and that she doesso not only under the strictest orders from her oculist butbecause literally the poor thing can t accomplish without such helphalf the business of life iffield however has suspectedsomething and his suspicions whether expressed or kept tohimself have put him on the watch i happened to have a glimpseof the movement at which he pounced on her and caught her in theact i had thought it all out my idea explained many things anddawling turned pale as he listened to me was he rough with her he anxiously asked how can i tell what passed between them i fled from the place my companion stared do you mean to say her eyesight s going heaven forbid in that case how could she take life as she does how does she take life that s the question he sat therebewilderedly brooding the tears rose to his lids they reminded meof those i had seen in flora s the day i risked my enquiry thequestion he had asked was one that to my own satisfaction i wasready to answer but i hesitated to let him hear as yet all that myreflections had suggested i was indeed privately astonished attheir ingenuity for the present i only rejoined that it struck meshe was playing a particular game at which he went on as if hehadn t heard me suddenly haunted with a fear lost in the darkpossibility do you mean there s a danger of anything very bad my dear fellow you must ask her special adviser who in the world is her special adviser i haven t a conception but we mustn t get too excited myimpression would be that she has only to observe a few ordinaryrules to exercise a little common sense dawling jumped at this i see to stick to the pince nez to follow to the letter her oculist s prescription whatever it isand at whatever cost to her prettiness it s not a thing to betrifled with upon my honour it shan t be he roundly declared and he adjustedhimself to his position again as if we had quite settled thebusiness after a considerable interval while i botched away hesuddenly said did they make a great difference a great difference those things she had put on oh the glasses in her beauty she looked queer of course but itwas partly because one was unaccustomed there are women who lookcharming in nippers what at any rate if she does look queer she must be mad not to accept that alternative she is mad said geoffrey dawling mad to refuse you i grant besides i went on the pince nez which was a large and peculiar one was all awry she had halfpulled it off but it continued to stick and she was crimson shewas angry it must have been horrible my companion groaned it was horrible but it s still more horrible to defy allwarnings it s still more horrible to be landed in withoutsaying in what i disgustedly shrugged my shoulders after a glance at me dawling jerked round then you do believethat she may be i hesitated the thing would be to make her believe it she onlyneeds a good scare but if that fellow is shocked at the precautions she does take oh who knows i rejoined with small sincerity i don t supposeiffield is absolutely a brute i would take her with leather blinders like a shying mare criedgeoffrey dawling i had an impression that iffield wouldn t but i didn t communicateit for i wanted to pacify my friend whom i had discomposed toomuch for the purposes of my sitting i recollect that i did somegood work that morning but it also comes back to me that before weseparated he had practically revealed to me that my anecdote connecting itself in his mind with a series of observations at thetime unconscious and unregistered had covered with light thesubject of our colloquy he had had a formless perception of somesecret that drove miss saunt to subterfuges and the more hethought of it the more he guessed this secret to be the practice ofmaking believe she saw when she didn t and of cleverly keepingpeople from finding out how little she saw when one pieced thingstogether it was astonishing what ground they covered just as hewas going away he asked me from what source at folkestone thehorrid tale had proceeded when i had given him as i saw noreason not to do the name of mrs meldrum he exclaimed oh iknow all about her she s a friend of some friends of mine atthis i remembered wilful betty and said to myself that i knew someone who would probably prove more wilful still chapter viiia few days later i again heard dawling on my stairs and evenbefore he passed my threshold i knew he had something to tell i ve been down to folkestone it was necessary i should see her i forget whether he had come straight from the station he was atany rate out of breath with his news which it took me however aminute to apply you mean that you ve been with mrs meldrum yes to ask her what she knows and how she comes to know it itworked upon me awfully i mean what you told me he made avisible effort to seem quieter than he was and it showed mesufficiently that he had not been reassured i laid to comforthim and smiling at a venture a friendly hand on his arm and hedropped into my eyes fixing them an instant a strange distendedlook which might have expressed the cold clearness of all that wasto come i know now he said with an emphasis he rarely used what then did mrs meldrum tell you only one thing that signified for she has no real knowledge butthat one thing was everything what is it then why that she can t bear the sight of her his pronouns requiredsome arranging but after i had successfully dealt with them ireplied that i was quite aware of miss saunt s trick of turning herback on the good lady of folkestone only what did that prove have you never guessed i guessed as soon as she spoke dawlingtowered over me in dismal triumph it was the first time in ouracquaintance that on any ground of understanding this hadoccurred but even so remarkable an incident still left mesufficiently at sea to cause him to continue why the effect ofthose spectacles i seemed to catch the tail of his idea mrs meldrum s they re so awfully ugly and they add so to the dear woman sugliness this remark began to flash a light and when he quicklyadded she sees herself she sees her own fate my response was soimmediate that i had almost taken the words out of his mouth while i tried to fix this sudden image of flora s face glazed inand cross barred even as mrs meldrum s was glazed and barred hewent on to assert that only the horror of that image looming outat herself could be the reason of her avoiding the person who soforced it home the fact he had encountered made everythinghideously vivid and more vivid than anything else that just suchanother pair of goggles was what would have been prescribed toflora i see i see i presently returned what would become of lordiffield if she were suddenly to come out in them what indeedwould become of every one what would become of everything thiswas an enquiry that dawling was evidently unprepared to meet and icompleted it by saying at last my dear fellow for that matter what would become of you once more he turned on me his good green eyes oh i shouldn tmind the tone of his words somehow made his ugly face beautiful and idiscovered at this moment how much i really liked him none theless at the same time perversely and rudely i felt the drollside of our discussion of such alternatives it made me laugh outand say to him while i laughed you d take her even with thosethings of mrs meldrum s he remained mournfully grave i could see that he was surprised atmy rude mirth but he summoned back a vision of the lady atfolkestone and conscientiously replied even with those things ofmrs meldrum s i begged him not to resent my laughter which butexposed the fact that we had built a monstrous castle in the air didn t he see on what flimsy ground the structure rested theevidence was preposterously small he believed the worst but wewere really uninformed i shall find out the truth he promptly replied how can you if you question her you ll simply drive her toperjure herself wherein after all does it concern you to know thetruth it s the girl s own affair then why did you tell me your story i was a trifle embarrassed to warn you off i smiled he tookno more notice of these words than presently to remark that lordiffield had no serious intentions very possibly i said butyou mustn t speak as if lord iffield and you were her onlyalternatives dawling thought a moment couldn t something be got out of thepeople she has consulted she must have been to people how elsecan she have been condemned condemned to what condemned to perpetual nippers of course shehas consulted some of the big specialists but she has done it youmay be sure in the most clandestine manner and even if it weresupposable that they would tell you anything which i altogetherdoubt you would have great difficulty in finding out which menthey are therefore leave it alone never show her what yoususpect i even before he quitted me asked him to promise me this allright i promise but he was gloomy enough he was a lover facingthe fact that there was no limit to the deceit his loved one wasready to practise it made so remarkably little difference icould see by what a stretch his passionate pity would from thismoment overlook the girl s fatuity and folly she was alwaysaccessible to him that i knew for if she had told him he was anidiot to dream she could dream of him she would have rebuked theimputation of having failed to make it clear that she would alwaysbe glad to regard him as a friend what were most of her friends what were all of them but repudiated idiots i was perfectlyaware that in her conversations and confidences i myself forinstance had a niche in the gallery as regards poor dawling iknew how often he still called on the hammond synges it was notthere but under the wing of the floyd taylors that her intimacywith lord iffield most flourished at all events when a weekafter the visit i have just summarised flora s name was one morningbrought up to me i jumped at the conclusion that dawling had beenwith her and even i fear briefly entertained the thought that hehad broken his word chapter ixshe left me after she had been introduced in no suspense abouther present motive she was on the contrary in a visible fever toenlighten me but i promptly learned that for the alarm with whichshe pitiably panted our young man was not accountable she had butone thought in the world and that thought was for lord iffield ihad the strangest saddest scene with her and if it did me no othergood it at least made me at last completely understand whyinsidiously from the first she had struck me as a creature oftragedy in showing me the whole of her folly it lifted thecurtain of her misery i don t know how much she meant to tell mewhen she came i think she had had plans of elaboratemisrepresentation at any rate she found it at the end of tenminutes the simplest way to break down and sob to be wretched andtrue when she had once begun to let herself go the movement tookher off her feet the relief of it was like the cessation of acramp she shared in a word her long secret she shifted her sharppain she brought i confess tears to my own eyes tears ofhelpless tenderness for her helpless poverty her visit howeverwas not quite so memorable in itself as in some of itsconsequences the most immediate of which was that i went thatafternoon to see geoffrey dawling who had in those days rooms inwelbeck street where i presented myself at an hour late enough towarrant the supposition that he might have come in he had notcome in but he was expected and i was invited to enter and waitfor him a lady i was informed was already in his sitting room i hesitated a little at a loss it had wildly coursed through mybrain that the lady was perhaps flora saunt but when i asked ifshe were young and remarkably pretty i received so significant a no sir that i risked an advance and after a minute in thismanner found myself to my astonishment face to face with mrs meldrum oh you dear thing she exclaimed i m delighted to see you youspare me another compromising demarche but for this i should havecalled on you also know the worst at once if you see me hereit s at least deliberate it s planned plotted shameless i cameup on purpose to see him upon my word i m in love with him why if you valued my peace of mind did you let him the other day atfolkestone dawn upon my delighted eyes i found myself there inhalf an hour simply infatuated with him with a perfect sense ofeverything that can be urged against him i hold him none the lessthe very pearl of men however i haven t come up to declare mypassion i ve come to bring him news that will interest him muchmore above all i ve come to urge upon him to be careful about flora saunt about what he says and does he must be as still as a mouse she s at last really engaged but it s a tremendous secret i was moved to mirth precisely she wired me this noon and spent another shilling totell me that not a creature in the world is yet to know it she had better have spent it to tell you that she had just passedan hour with the creature you see before you she has just passed an hour with every one in the place mrs meldrum cried they ve vital reasons she says for it s notcoming out for a month then it will be formally announced butmeanwhile her rejoicing is wild i daresay mr dawling alreadyknows and as it s nearly seven o clock may have jumped off londonbridge but an effect of the talk i had with him the other day wasto make me on receipt of my telegram feel it to be my duty towarn him in person against taking action so to call it on thehorrid certitude which i could see he carried away with him i hadadded somehow to that certitude he told me what you had told himyou had seen in your shop mrs meldrum i perceived had come to welbeck street on an errandidentical with my own a circumstance indicating her rare sagacity inasmuch as her ground for undertaking it was a very differentthing from what flora s wonderful visit had made of mine iremarked to her that what i had seen in the shop was sufficientlystriking but that i had seen a great deal more that morning in mystudio in short i said i ve seen everything she was mystified everything the poor creature is under the darkest of clouds oh she came totriumph but she remained to talk something in the nature of sense she put herself completely in my hands she does me the honour tointimate that of all her friends i m the most disinterested aftershe had announced to me that lord iffield was utterly committed toher and that for the present i was absolutely the only person inthe secret she arrived at her real business she had had asuspicion of me ever since that day at folkestone when i asked herfor the truth about her eyes the truth is what you and i bothguessed she s in very bad danger but from what cause i who by god s mercy have kept mine knoweverything that can be known about eyes said mrs meldrum she might have kept hers if she had profited by god s mercy ifshe had done in time done years ago what was imperatively orderedher if she hadn t in fine been cursed with the loveliness that wasto make her behaviour a thing of fable she may still keep hersight or what remains of it if she ll sacrifice and after all solittle that purely superficial charm she must do as you ve done she must wear dear lady what you wear what my companion wore glittered for the moment like a melon framein august heaven forgive her now i understand she flushedfor dismay but i wasn t afraid of the effect on her good nature of her thusseeing through her great goggles why it had always been thatflora held her at such a distance i can t tell you i said from what special affection what state of the eye her dangerproceeds that s the one thing she succeeded this morning inkeeping from me she knows it herself perfectly she has had thebest advice in europe it s a thing that s awful simply awful that was the only account she would give me year before last while she was at boulogne she went for three days with mrs floyd taylor to paris she there surreptitiously consulted the greatestman even mrs floyd taylor doesn t know last autumn in germanyshe did the same first put on certain special spectacles with astraight bar in the middle then we ll talk that s practicallywhat they say what she says is that she ll put on anything innature when she s married but that she must get married first she has always meant to do everything as soon as she s married then and then only she ll be safe how will any one ever look ather if she makes herself a fright how could she ever have gotengaged if she had made herself a fright from the first it s nouse to insist that with her beauty she can never be a fright shesaid to me this morning poor girl the most characteristic themost harrowing things my face is all i have and such a face iknew from the first i could do anything with it but i needed itall i need it still every exquisite inch of it it isn t as if ihad a figure or anything else oh if god had only given me afigure too i don t say yes with a figure a really good one like fanny floyd taylor s who s hideous i d have risked plainglasses que voulez vous no one is perfect she says she stillhas money left but i don t believe a word of it she has beenspeculating on her impunity on the idea that her danger would holdoff she has literally been running a race with it her theoryhas been as you from the first so clearly saw that she d get inahead she swears to me that though the bar is too cruel shewears when she s alone what she has been ordered to wear but whenthe deuce is she alone it s herself of course that she hasswindled worst she has put herself off so insanely that even herconceit but half accounts for it with little inadequateconcessions little false measures and preposterous evasions andchildish hopes her great terror is now that iffield who alreadyhas suspicions who has found out her pince nez but whom she hasbeguiled with some unblushing hocus pocus may discover thedreadful facts and the essence of what she wanted this morning wasin that interest to square me to get me to deny indignantly andauthoritatively for isn t she my favourite sitter that she hasanything in life the matter with any part of her she sobbed she went on she entreated after we got talking her extraordinarynerve left her and she showed me what she has been through showedme also all her terror of the harm i could do her wait till i mmarried wait till i m married she took hold of me she almostsank on her knees it seems to me highly immoral one sparticipation in her fraud but there s no doubt that she must bemarried i don t know what i don t see behind it therefore iwound up dawling must keep his hands off mrs meldrum had held her breath she gave out a long moan well that s exactly what i came here to tell him then here he is our host all unprepared his latchkey still inhis hand had just pushed open the door and startled at findingus turned a frightened look from one to the other wondering whatdisaster we were there to announce or avert mrs meldrum was on the spot all gaiety i ve come to return yoursweet visit ah she laughed i mean to keep up theacquaintance do do he murmured mechanically and absently continuing to lookat us then he broke out he s going to marry her i was surprised you already know he produced an evening paper which he tossed down on the table it s in that published already i was still more surprised oh flora can t keep a secret mrs meldrum made it light shewent up to poor dawling and laid a motherly hand upon him it s all right it s just as it ought to be don t think abouther ever any more then as he met this adjuration with a starefrom which thought and of the most defiant and dismal fairlyprotruded the excellent woman put up her funny face and tenderlykissed him on the cheek chapter xi have spoken of these reminiscences as of a row of coloured beads and i confess that as i continue to straighten out my chaplet i amrather proud of the comparison the beads are all there as isaid they slip along the string in their small smooth roundness geoffrey dawling accepted as a gentleman the event his eveningpaper had proclaimed in view of which i snatched a moment to nudgehim a hint that he might offer mrs meldrum his hand he returnedme a heavy head shake and i judged that marriage would henceforthstrike him very much as the traffic of the street may strike somepoor incurable at the window of an hospital circumstances arisingat this time led to my making an absence from england andcircumstances already existing offered him a firm basis for similaraction he had after all the usual resource of a briton he couldtake to his boats always drawn up in our background he startedon a journey round the globe and i was left with nothing but myinference as to what might have happened later observationhowever only confirmed my belief that if at any time during thecouple of months after flora saunt s brilliant engagement he hadmade up as they say to the good lady of folkestone that goodlady would not have pushed him over the cliff strange as she wasto behold i knew of cases in which she had been obliged toadminister that shove i went to new york to paint a couple ofportraits but i found once on the spot that i had countedwithout chicago where i was invited to blot out this harshdiscrimination by the production of some dozen i spent a year inamerica and should probably have spent a second had i not beensummoned back to england by alarming news from my mother herstrength had failed and as soon as i reached london i hurried downto folkestone arriving just at the moment to offer a welcome tosome slight symptom of a rally she had been much worse but wasnow a little better and though i found nothing but satisfaction inhaving come to her i saw after a few hours that my london studio where arrears of work had already met me would be my place toawait whatever might next occur yet before returning to town icalled on mrs meldrum from whom i had not had a line and my viewof whom with the adjacent objects as i had left them had beenintercepted by a luxuriant foreground before i had gained her house i met her as i supposed comingtoward me across the down greeting me from afar with the familiartwinkle of her great vitreous badge and as it was late in theautumn and the esplanade a blank i was free to acknowledge thissignal by cutting a caper on the grass my enthusiasm droppedindeed the next moment for i had seen in a few more seconds thatthe person thus assaulted had by no means the figure of my militaryfriend i felt a shock much greater than any i should have thoughtpossible when on this person s drawing near i knew her for poorlittle flora saunt at what moment she had recognised me belongedto an order of mysteries over which it quickly came home to me one would never linger again once we were face to face it sochiefly mattered that i should succeed in looking entirelyunastonished all i at first saw was the big gold bar crossingeach of her lenses over which something convex and grotesque likethe eyes of a large insect something that now represented herwhole personality seemed as out of the orifice of a prison tostrain forward and press the face had shrunk away it lookedsmaller appeared even to look plain it was at all events so faras the effect on a spectator was concerned wholly sacrificed tothis huge apparatus of sight there was no smile in it and shemade no motion to take my offered hand i had no idea you were down here i said and i wondered whethershe didn t know me at all or knew me only by my voice you thought i was mrs meldrum she ever so quietly answered it was just this low pitch that made me protest with laughter ohyes you have a tremendous deal in common with mrs meldrum i vejust returned to england after a long absence and i m on my way tosee her won t you come with me it struck me that her oldreason for keeping clear of our friend was well disposed of now i ve just left her i m staying with her she stood solemnlyfixing me with her goggles would you like to paint me now sheasked she seemed to speak with intense gravity from behind amask or a cage there was nothing to do but treat the question still with highspirits it would be a fascinating little artistic problem that something was wrong it wasn t difficult to see but a gooddeal more than met the eye might be presumed to be wrong if florawas under mrs meldrum s roof i hadn t for a year had much timeto think of her but my imagination had had ground for lodging herin more gilded halls one of the last things i had heard beforeleaving england was that in commemoration of the new relationshipshe had gone to stay with lady considine this had made me takeeverything else for granted and the noisy american world haddeafened my care to possible contradictions her spectacles wereat present a direct contradiction they seemed a negation not onlyof new relationships but of every old one as well i remembernevertheless that when after a moment she walked beside me on thegrass i found myself nervously hoping she wouldn t as yet at anyrate tell me anything very dreadful so that to stave off thisdanger i harried her with questions about mrs meldrum and withoutwaiting for replies became profuse on the subject of my owndoings my companion was finely silent and i felt both as if shewere watching my nervousness with a sort of sinister irony and asif i were talking to some different and strange person floraplain and obscure and dumb was no flora at all at mrs meldrum sdoor she turned off with the observation that as there wascertainly a great deal i should have to say to our friend she hadbetter not go in with me i looked at her again i had beenkeeping my eyes away from her but only to meet her magnifiedstare i greatly desired in truth to see mrs meldrum alone butthere was something so grim in the girl s trouble that i hesitatedto fall in with this idea of dropping her yet one couldn texpress a compassion without seeming to take for granted moretrouble than there actually might have been i reflected that imust really figure to her as a fool which was an entertainment ihad never expected to give her it rolled over me there for thefirst time it has come back to me since that there is wondrously in very deep and even in very foolish misfortune adignity still finer than in the most inveterate habit of being allright i couldn t have to her the manner of treating it as a meredetail that i was face to face with a part of what at our lastmeeting we had had such a scene about but while i was trying tothink of some manner that i could have she said quite colourlessly though somehow as if she might never see me again good bye i mgoing to take my walk all alone she looked round the great bleak cliff top with whom should igo besides i like to be alone for the present this gave me the glimmer of a vision that she regarded herdisfigurement as temporary and the confidence came to me that shewould never for her happiness cease to be a creature ofillusions it enabled me to exclaim smiling brightly and feelingindeed idiotic oh i shall see you again but i hope you ll havea very pleasant walk all my walks are pleasant thank you they do me such a lot ofgood she was as quiet as a mouse and her words seemed to mestupendous in their wisdom i take several a day she continued she might have been an ancient woman responding with humility atthe church door to the patronage of the parson the more i takethe better i feel i m ordered by the doctors to keep all thewhile in the air and go in for plenty of exercise it keeps up mygeneral health you know and if that goes on improving as it haslately done everything will soon be all right all that was thematter with me before and always it was too reckless was that ineglected my general health it acts directly on the state of theparticular organ so i m going three miles i grinned at her from the doorstep while mrs meldrum s maid stoodthere to admit me oh i m so glad i said looking at her as shepaced away with the pretty flutter she had kept and remembering theday when while she rejoined lord iffield i had indulged in thesame observation her air of assurance was on this occasion notless than it had been on that but i recalled that she had thenstruck me as marching off to her doom was she really now marchingaway from it chapter xias soon as i saw mrs meldrum i of course broke out is thereanything in it is her general health mrs meldrum checked me with her great amused blare you vealready seen her and she has told you her wondrous tale what s in it is what has been in everything she has ever done the mostcomical tragical belief in herself she thinks she s doing a cure and what does her husband think her husband what husband hasn t she then married lord iffield vous en etes le cried my hostess why he behaved like aregular beast how should i know you never wrote me mrs meldrum hesitated covering me with what poor flora called the particular organ no i didn t write you i abstained on purpose if i kept quiet ithought you mightn t hear over there what had happened if youshould hear i was afraid you would stir up mr dawling stir him up urge him to fly to the rescue write out to him that there wasanother chance for him i wouldn t have done it i said well mrs meldrum replied it was not my business to give youan opportunity in short you were afraid of it again she hesitated and though it may have been only my fancy ithought she considerably reddened at all events she laughed out then i was afraid of it she very honestly answered but doesn t he know has he given no sign every sign in life he came straight back to her he dideverything to get her to listen to him but she hasn t the smallestidea of it has he seen her as she is now i presently and just a trifleawkwardly enquired indeed he has and borne it like a hero he told me all aboutit how much you ve all been through i found occasion to remark then what has become of him he s at home in hampshire he has got back his old place and ibelieve by this time his old sisters it s not half a bad littleplace yet its attractions say nothing to flora oh flora s by no means on her back my fried declared she s not on her back because she s on yours have you got herfor the rest of your life once more mrs meldrum genially glared did she tell you how muchthe hammond synges have kindly left her to live on not quiteeighty pounds a year that s a good deal but it won t pay the oculist what was itthat at last induced her to submit to him her general collapse after that brute of an iffield s rupture she cried her eyes out she passed through a horror of blackdarkness then came a gleam of light and the light appears tohave broadened she went into goggles as repentant magdalens gointo the catholic church in spite of which you don t think she ll be saved she thinks she will that s all i can tell you there s no doubtthat when once she brought herself to accept her real remedy asshe calls it she began to enjoy a relief that she had never known that feeling very new and in spite of what she pays for it mostrefreshing has given her something to hold on by begotten in herfoolish little mind a belief that as she says she s on the mendand that in the course of time if she leads a tremendously healthylife she ll be able to take off her muzzle and become as dangerousagain as ever it keeps her going and what keeps you you re good until the parties begin again oh she doesn t object to me now smiled mrs meldrum i m goingto take her abroad we shall be a pretty pair i was struck withthis energy and after a moment i enquired the reason of it it sto divert her mind my friend replied reddening again a little ithought we shall go next week i ve only waited to see how yourmother would be before starting i expressed to her hereupon mysense of her extraordinary merit and also that of theinconceivability of flora s fancying herself still in a situationnot to jump at the chance of marrying a man like dawling shesays he s too ugly she says he s too dreary she says in fact he s nobody mrs meldrum pursued she says above all that he s not her own sort she doesn t deny that he s good but she finds himimpossibly ridiculous he s quite the last person she would everdream of i was almost disposed on hearing this to protest thatif the girl had so little proper feeling her noble suitor hadperhaps served her right but after a while my curiosity as to justhow her noble suitor had served her got the better of that emotion and i asked a question or two which led my companion again to applyto him the invidious term i have already quoted what had happenedwas simply that flora had at the eleventh hour broken down in theattempt to put him off with an uncandid account of her infirmityand that his lordship s interest in her had not been proof againstthe discovery of the way she had practised on him herdissimulation he was obliged to perceive had been infernallydeep the future in short assumed a new complexion for him whenlooked at through the grim glasses of a bride who as he had saidto some one couldn t really when you came to find out see herhand before her face he had conducted himself like any otherjockeyed customer he had returned the animal as unsound he hadbacked out in his own way giving the business by some sharpshuffle such a turn as to make the rupture ostensibly flora s buthe had none the less remorselessly and basely backed out he hadcared for her lovely face cared for it in the amused and hauntedway it had been her poor little delusive gift to make men care andher lovely face damn it with the monstrous gear she had begun torig upon it was just what had let him in he had in the judgmentof his family done everything that could be expected of him he hadmade mrs meldrum had herself seen the letter a handsome offerof pecuniary compensation oh if flora with her incrediblebuoyancy was in a manner on her feet again now it was not that shehad not for weeks and weeks been prone in the dust strange werethe humiliations the forms of anguish it was given some naturesto survive that flora had survived was perhaps after all a proofshe was reserved for some final mercy but she has been in theabysses at any rate said mrs meldrum and i really don t thinki can tell you what pulled her through i think i can tell you i returned what in the world but mrs meldrum at the end of an hour flora had not come in and i was obliged toannounce that i should have but time to reach the station where iwas to find my luggage in charge of my mother s servant mrs meldrum put before me the question of waiting till a later train so as not to lose our young lady but i confess i gave thisalternative a consideration less acute than i pretended somehow ididn t care if i did lose our young lady now that i knew theworst that had befallen her it struck me still less as possible tomeet her on the ground of condolence and with the sad appearanceshe wore to me what other ground was left i lost her but icaught my train in truth she was so changed that one hated to seeit and now that she was in charitable hands one didn t feelcompelled to make great efforts i had studied her face for aparticular beauty i had lived with that beauty and reproduced it but i knew what belonged to my trade well enough to be sure it wasgone for ever chapter xiii was soon called back to folkestone but mrs meldrum and heryoung friend had already left england finding to that end everyconvenience on the spot and not having had to come up to town mythoughts however were so painfully engaged there that i should inany case have had little attention for them the event occurredthat was to bring my series of visits to a close when this hightide had ebbed i returned to america and to my interrupted work which had opened out on such a scale that with a deep plunge intoa great chance i was three good years in rising again to thesurface there are nymphs and naiads moreover in the americandepths they may have had something to do with the duration of mydive i mention them to account for a grave misdemeanor the factthat after the first year i rudely neglected mrs meldrum she hadwritten to me from florence after my mother s death and hadmentioned in a postscript that in our young lady s calculations thelowest figures were now italian counts this was a good omen andif in subsequent letters there was no news of a sequel i wascontent to accept small things and to believe that grave tidings should there be any would come to me in due course the gravityof what might happen to a featherweight became indeed with time anddistance less appreciable and i was not without an impression thatmrs meldrum whose sense of proportion was not the least of hermerits had no idea of boring the world with the ups and downs ofher pensioner the poor girl grew dusky and dim a small fitfulmemory a regret tempered by the comfortable consciousness of howkind mrs meldrum would always be to her i was professionallymore preoccupied than i had ever been and i had swarms of prettyfaces in my eyes and a chorus of loud tones in my ears geoffreydawling had on his return to england written me two or threeletters his last information had been that he was going into thefigures of rural illiteracy i was delighted to receive it and hadno doubt that if he should go into figures they would as they aresaid to be able to prove anything prove at least that my advicewas sound and that he had wasted time enough this quickened on mypart another hope a hope suggested by some roundabout rumour iforget how it reached me that he was engaged to a girl down inhampshire he turned out not to be but i felt sure that if onlyhe went into figures deep enough he would become among the girlsdown in hampshire or elsewhere one of those numerous prizes ofbattle whose defences are practically not on the scale of theirprovocations i nursed in short the thought that it was probablyopen to him to develop as one of the types about whom as the yearsgo on superficial critics wonder without relief how they eversucceeded in dragging a bride to the altar he never alluded toflora saunt and there was in his silence about her quite as inmrs meldrum s an element of instinctive tact a brief implicationthat if you didn t happen to have been in love with her there wasnothing to be said within a week after my return to london i went to the opera ofwhich i had always been much of a devotee i arrived too late forthe first act of lohengrin but the second was just beginning and i gave myself up to it with no more than a glance at the house when it was over i treated myself with my glass from my place inthe stalls to a general survey of the boxes making doubtless ontheir contents the reflections pointed by comparison that aremost familiar to the wanderer restored to london there was thecommon sprinkling of pretty women but i suddenly noted that one ofthese was far prettier than the others this lady alone in one ofthe smaller receptacles of the grand tier and already the aim offifty tentative glasses which she sustained with admirableserenity this single exquisite figure placed in the quarterfurthest removed from my stall was a person i immediately felt to cause one s curiosity to linger dressed in white withdiamonds in her hair and pearls on her neck she had a paleradiance of beauty which even at that distance made her adistinguished presence and with the air that easily attaches tolonely loveliness in public places an agreeable mystery amystery however she remained to me only for a minute after i hadlevelled my glass at her i feel to this moment the startledthrill the shock almost of joy with which i translated her vaguebrightness into a resurrection of flora i say a resurrection because to put it crudely i had on that last occasion left ouryoung woman for dead at present perfectly alive again she wasaltered only as it were by this fact of life a little older alittle quieter a little finer and a good deal fairer she wassimply transfigured by having recovered sustained by thereflection that even her recovery wouldn t enable her todistinguish me in the crowd i was free to look at her well thenit was it came home to me that my vision of her in her greatgoggles had been cruelly final as her beauty was all there was ofher that machinery had extinguished her and so far as i hadthought of her in the interval i had thought of her as buried inthe tomb her stern specialist had built with the sense that shehad escaped from it came a lively wish to return to her and if ididn t straightway leave my place and rush round the theatre and upto her box it was because i was fixed to the spot some momentslonger by the simple inability to cease looking at her she had been from the first of my seeing her practicallymotionless leaning back in her chair with a kind of thoughtfulgrace and with her eyes vaguely directed as it seemed on me toone of the boxes on my side of the house and consequently over myhead and out of my sight the only movement she made for some timewas to finger with an ungloved hand and as if with the habit offondness the row of pearls on her neck which my glass showed me tobe large and splendid her diamonds and pearls in her solitude mystified me making me as she had had no such brave jewels in thedays of the hammond synges wonder what undreamt of improvement hadtaken place in her fortunes the ghost of a question hovered therea moment could anything so prodigious have happened as that onher tested and proved amendment lord iffield had taken her back this could scarce have without my hearing of it and moreover ifshe had become a person of such fashion where was the little courtone would naturally see at her elbow her isolation was puzzling though it could easily suggest that she was but momentarily alone if she had come with mrs meldrum that lady would have takenadvantage of the interval to pay a visit to some other box doubtless the box at which flora had just been looking mrs meldrum didn t account for the jewels but the revival of flora sbeauty accounted for anything she presently moved her eyes overthe house and i felt them brush me again like the wings of a dove i don t know what quick pleasure flickered into the hope that shewould at last see me she did see me she suddenly bent forwardto take up the little double barrelled ivory glass that rested onthe edge of the box and to all appearance fix me with it i smiledfrom my place straight up at the searching lenses and after aninstant she dropped them and smiled as straight back at me oh hersmile it was her old smile her young smile her very own smilemade perfect i instantly left my stall and hurried off for anearer view of it quite flushed i remember as i went with theannoyance of having happened to think of the idiotic way i hadtried to paint her poor iffield with his sample of that error and still poorer dawling in particular with his i hadn t touchedher i was professionally humiliated and as the attendant in thelobby opened her box for me i felt that the very first thing ishould have to say to her would be that she must absolutely sit tome again chapter xiiishe gave me the smile once more as over her shoulder from herchair she turned her face to me here you are again sheexclaimed with her disgloved hand put up a little backward for meto take i dropped into a chair just behind her and having takenit and noted that one of the curtains of the box would make thedemonstration sufficiently private bent my lips over it andimpressed them on its finger tips it was given me however to myastonishment to feel next that all the privacy in the worldcouldn t have sufficed to mitigate the start with which she greetedthis free application of my moustache the blood had jumped to herface she quickly recovered her hand and jerked at me twistingherself round a vacant challenging stare during the next fewinstants several extraordinary things happened the first of whichwas that now i was close to them the eyes of loveliness i had comeup to look into didn t show at all the conscious light i had justbeen pleased to see them flash across the house they showed onthe contrary to my confusion a strange sweet blankness anexpression i failed to give a meaning to until without delay ifelt on my arm directed to it as if instantly to efface the effectof her start the grasp of the hand she had impulsively snatchedfrom me it was the irrepressible question in this grasp thatstopped on my lips all sound of salutation she had mistaken myentrance for that of another person a pair of lips without amoustache she was feeling me to see who i was with theperception of this and of her not seeing me i sat gaping at her andat the wild word that didn t come the right word to express or todisguise my dismay what was the right word to commemorate one ssudden discovery at the very moment too at which one had been mostencouraged to count on better things that one s dear old friendhad gone blind before the answer to this question dropped uponme and the moving moments though few seemed many i heard withthe sound of voices the click of the attendant s key on the otherside of the door poor flora heard also and on hearing still withher hand on my arm brightened again as i had a minute since seenher brighten across the house she had the sense of the return ofthe person she had taken me for the person with the right pair oflips as to whom i was for that matter much more in the dark thanshe i gasped but my word had come if she had lost her sight itwas in this very loss that she had found again her beauty imanaged to speak while we were still alone before her companionhad appeared you re lovelier at this day than you have ever beenin your life at the sound of my voice and that of the opening ofthe door her impatience broke into audible joy she sprang up recognising me always holding me and gleefully cried to agentleman who was arrested in the doorway by the sight of me hehas come back he has come back and you should have heard what hesays of me the gentleman was geoffrey dawling and i thought itbest to let him hear on the spot how beautiful she is my dearman but how extraordinarily beautiful more beautiful at thishour than ever ever before it gave them almost equal pleasure and made dawling blush to hiseyes while this in turn produced in spite of deepenedastonishment a blest snap of the strain i had been strugglingwith i wanted to embrace them both and while the opening bars ofanother scene rose from the orchestra i almost did embrace dawling whose first emotion on beholding me had visibly and ever so oddlybeen a consciousness of guilt i had caught him somehow in theact though that was as yet all i knew but by the time we sanknoiselessly into our chairs again for the music was supreme wagner passed first my demonstration ought pretty well to havegiven him the limit of the criticism he had to fear i myselfindeed while the opera blazed was only too afraid he might divinein our silent closeness the very moral of my optimism which wassimply the comfort i had gathered from seeing that if ourcompanion s beauty lived again her vanity partook of its life ihad hit on the right note that was what eased me off it drew allpain for the next half hour from the sense of the deep darkness inwhich the stricken woman sat if the music in that darkness happily soared and swelled for her it beat its wings in unisonwith those of a gratified passion a great deal came and wentbetween us without profaning the occasion so that i could feel atthe end of twenty minutes as if i knew almost everything he mightin kindness have to tell me knew even why flora while i stared ather from the stalls had misled me by the use of ivory and crystaland by appearing to recognise me and smile she leaned back in herchair in luxurious ease i had from the first become aware thatthe way she fingered her pearls was a sharp image of the weddedstate nothing of old had seemed wanting to her assurance but ihadn t then dreamed of the art with which she would wear thatassurance as a married woman she had taken him when everythinghad failed he had taken her when she herself had done so hisembarrassed eyes confessed it all confessed the deep peace hefound in it they only didn t tell me why he had not written tome nor clear up as yet a minor obscurity flora after a whileagain lifted the glass from the ledge of the box and elegantlyswept the house with it then by the mere instinct of her grace a motion but half conscious she inclined her head into the voidwith the sketch of a salute producing i could see a perfectimitation of response to some homage dawling and i looked at eachother again the tears came into his eyes she was playing atperfection still and her misfortune only simplified the process i recognised that this was as near as i should ever come certainlyas i should come that night to pressing on her misfortune neither of us would name it more than we were doing then and florawould never name it at all little by little i saw that what hadoccurred was strange as it might appear the best thing for herhappiness the question was now only of her beauty and her beingseen and marvelled at with dawling to do for her everything inlife her activity was limited to that such an activity was allwithin her scope it asked nothing of her that she couldn tsplendidly give as from time to time in our delicate communionshe turned her face to me with the parody of a look i lost none ofthe signs of its strange new glory the expression of the eyes wasa rub of pastel from a master s thumb the whole head stamped witha sort of showy suffering had gained a fineness from what she hadpassed through yes flora was settled for life nothing couldhurt her further i foresaw the particular praise she would mostlyincur she would be invariably interesting she would charm withher pathos more even than she had charmed with her pleasure forherself above all she was fixed for ever rescued from all changeand ransomed from all doubt her old certainties her old vanitieswere justified and sanctified and in the darkness that had closedupon her one object remained clear that object as unfading as amosaic mask was fortunately the loveliest she could possibly lookupon the greatest blessing of all was of course that dawlingthought so her future was ruled with the straightest line and sofor that matter was his there were two facts to which before ileft my friends i gave time to sink into my spirit one was thathe had changed by some process as effective as flora s change hadbeen simplified somehow into service as she had been simplifiedinto success he was such a picture of inspired intervention as ihad never yet conceived he would exist henceforth for the solepurpose of rendering unnecessary or rather impossible anyreference even on her own part to his wife s infirmity oh yes how little desire he would ever give me to refer to it heprincipally after a while made me feel and this was my secondlesson that good natured as he was my being there to see it alloppressed him so that by the time the act ended i recognised thati too had filled out my hour dawling remembered things i thinkhe caught in my very face the irony of old judgments they madehim thresh about in his chair i said to flora as i took leave ofher that i would come to see her but i may mention that i neverwent i d go to morrow if i hear she wants me but what in theworld can she ever want as i quitted them i laid my hand ondawling s arm and drew him for a moment into the lobby why did you never write to me of your marriage he smiled uncomfortably showing his long yellow teeth andsomething more i don t know the whole thing gave me such atremendous lot to do this was the first dishonest speech i had heard him make hereally hadn t written because an idea that i would think him astill bigger fool than before i didn t insist but i tried therein the lobby so far as a pressure of his hand could serve me togive him a notion of what i thought him i can t at any rate makeout i said why i didn t hear from mrs meldrum she didn t write to you never a word what has become of her i think she s at folkestone dawling returned but i m sorry tosay that practically she has ceased to see us you haven t quarrelled with her how could we think of all we owe her at the time of ourmarriage and for months before she did everything for us idon t know how we should have managed without her but since thenshe has never been near us and has given us rather markedly littleencouragement to keep up relations with her i was struck with this though of course i admit i am struck withall sorts of things well i said after a moment even if icould imagine a reason for that attitude it wouldn t explain whyshe shouldn t have taken account of my natural interest just so dawling s face was a windowless wall he couldcontribute nothing to the mystery and quitting him i carried itaway it was not till i went down to ace mrs meldrum that wasreally dispelled she didn t want to hear of them or to talk ofthem not a bit and it was just in the same spirit that she hadn twanted to write of them she had done everything in the world forthem but now thank heaven the hard business was over after ihad taken this in which i was quick to do we quite avoided thesubject she simply couldn t bear it the golden bowl volume ihenry james book first the princepart firstithe prince had always liked his london when it had come to him he was one of the modern romans who find by the thames a moreconvincing image of the truth of the ancient state than any theyhave left by the tiber brought up on the legend of the city towhich the world paid tribute he recognised in the present londonmuch more than in contemporary rome the real dimensions of such acase if it was a question of an imperium he said to himself and if one wished as a roman to recover a little the sense ofthat the place to do so was on london bridge or even on a fineafternoon in may at hyde park corner it was not indeed toeither of those places that these grounds of his predilection after all sufficiently vague had at the moment we are concernedwith him guided his steps he had strayed simply enough intobond street where his imagination working at comparativelyshort range caused him now and then to stop before a window inwhich objects massive and lumpish in silver and gold in theforms to which precious stones contribute or in leather steel brass applied to a hundred uses and abuses were as tumbledtogether as if in the insolence of the empire they had been theloot of far off victories the young man s movements however betrayed no consistency of attention not even for that matter when one of his arrests had proceeded from possibilities in facesshaded as they passed him on the pavement by huge beribbonedhats or more delicately tinted still under the tense silk ofparasols held at perverse angles in waiting victorias and theprince s undirected thought was not a little symptomatic since though the turn of the season had come and the flush of thestreets begun to fade the possibilities of faces on the augustafternoon were still one of the notes of the scene he was toorestless that was the fact for any concentration and the lastidea that would just now have occurred to him in any connectionwas the idea of pursuit he had been pursuing for six months as never in his life before and what had actually unsteadied him as we join him was thesense of how he had been justified capture had crowned thepursuit or success as he would otherwise have put it hadrewarded virtue whereby the consciousness of these things madehim for the hour rather serious than gay a sobriety that mighthave consorted with failure sat in his handsome face constructively regular and grave yet at the same time oddly and as might be functionally almost radiant with its dark blueeyes its dark brown moustache and its expression no more sharply foreign to an english view than to have caused it sometimes tobe observed of him with a shallow felicity that he looked like a refined irishman what had happened was that shortly before atthree o clock his fate had practically been sealed and thateven when one pretended to no quarrel with it the moment hadsomething of the grimness of a crunched key in the strongest lockthat could be made there was nothing to do as yet further butfeel what one had done and our personage felt it while heaimlessly wandered it was already as if he were married sodefinitely had the solicitors at three o clock enabled the dateto be fixed and by so few days was that date now distant hewas to dine at half past eight o clock with the young lady onwhose behalf and on whose father s the london lawyers hadreached an inspired harmony with his own man of business poorcalderoni fresh from rome and now apparently in the wondroussituation of being shown london before promptly leaving itagain by mr verver himself mr verver whose easy way with hismillions had taxed to such small purpose in the arrangements the principle of reciprocity the reciprocity with which theprince was during these minutes most struck was that ofcalderoni s bestowal of his company for a view of the lions ifthere was one thing in the world the young man at this juncture clearly intended it was to be much more decent as a son in lawthan lots of fellows he could think of had shown themselves inthat character he thought of these fellows from whom he was soto differ in english he used mentally the english term todescribe his difference for familiar with the tongue from hisearliest years so that no note of strangeness remained with himeither for lip or for ear he found it convenient in life forthe greatest number of relations he found it convenient oddly even for his relation with himself though not unmindful thatthere might still as time went on be others including a moreintimate degree of that one that would seek possibly withviolence the larger or the finer issue which was it of thevernacular miss verver had told him he spoke english too well it was his only fault and he had not been able to speak worseeven to oblige her when i speak worse you see i speakfrench he had said intimating thus that there werediscriminations doubtless of the invidious kind for which thatlanguage was the most apt the girl had taken this she let himknow as a reflection on her own french which she had always sodreamed of making good of making better to say nothing of hisevident feeling that the idiom supposed a cleverness she was nota person to rise to the prince s answer to such remarks genial charming like every answer the parties to his new arrangementhad yet had from him was that he was practising his american inorder to converse properly on equal terms as it were with mr verver his prospective father in law had a command of it hesaid that put him at a disadvantage in any discussion besideswhich well besides which he had made to the girl theobservation that positively of all his observations yet hadmost finely touched her you know i think he s a real galantuomo and no mistake thereare plenty of sham ones about he seems to me simply the best mani ve ever seen in my life well my dear why shouldn t he be the girl had gailyinquired it was this precisely that had set the prince to think thethings or many of them that had made mr verver what he wasseemed practically to bring a charge of waste against the otherthings that with the other people known to the young man hadfailed of such a result why his form he had returned might have made one doubt father s form she hadn t seen it it strikes me he hasn t gotany he hasn t got mine he hasn t even got yours thank you for even the girl had laughed at him oh yours my dear is tremendous but your father has his own i ve madethat out so don t doubt it it s where it has brought him out that s the point it s his goodness that has brought him out our young womanhad at this objected ah darling goodness i think never brought anyone out goodness when it s real precisely rather keeps people in hehad been interested in his discrimination which amused him no it s his way it belongs to him but she had wondered still it s the american way that s all exactly it s all it s all i say it fits him so it must begood for something do you think it would be good for you maggie verver hadsmilingly asked to which his reply had been just of the happiest i don t feel my dear if you really want to know that anything much can noweither hurt me or help me such as i am but you ll see foryourself say however i am a galantuomo which i devoutly hope i m like a chicken at best chopped up and smothered in sauce cooked down as a creme de volaille with half the parts left out your father s the natural fowl running about the bassecour hisfeathers movements his sounds those are the parts that withme are left out all as a matter of course since you can t eat a chickenalive the prince had not been annoyed at this but he had beenpositive well i m eating your father alive which is the onlyway to taste him i want to continue and as it s when he talksamerican that he is most alive so i must also cultivate it toget my pleasure he couldn t make one like him so much in anyother language it mattered little that the girl had continued to demur it wasthe mere play of her joy i think he could make you like him inchinese it would be an unnecessary trouble what i mean is that he s akind of result of his inevitable tone my liking is accordinglyfor the tone which has made him possible oh you ll hear enough of it she laughed before you ve donewith us only this in truth had made him frown a little what do you mean please by my having done with you why found out about us all there is to find he had been able to take it indeed easily as a joke ah love ibegan with that i know enough i feel never to be surprised it s you yourselves meanwhile he continued who really knownothing there are two parts of me yes he had been moved to goon one is made up of the history the doings the marriages the crimes the follies the boundless betises of other people especially of their infamous waste of money that might have cometo me those things are written literally in rows of volumes inlibraries are as public as they re abominable everybody can getat them and you ve both of you wonderfully looked them in theface but there s another part very much smaller doubtless which such as it is represents my single self the unknown unimportant unimportant unimportant save to you personalquantity about this you ve found out nothing luckily my dear the girl had bravely said for what thenwould become please of the promised occupation of my future the young man remembered even now how extraordinarily clear hecouldn t call it anything else she had looked in herprettiness as she had said it he also remembered what he hadbeen moved to reply the happiest reigns we are taught youknow are the reigns without any history oh i m not afraid of history she had been sure of that callit the bad part if you like yours certainly sticks out of you what was it else maggie verver had also said that made meoriginally think of you it wasn t as i should suppose you musthave seen what you call your unknown quantity your particularself it was the generations behind you the follies and thecrimes the plunder and the waste the wicked pope the monstermost of all whom so many of the volumes in your family libraryare all about if i ve read but two or three yet i shall givemyself up but the more as soon as i have time to the rest where therefore she had put it to him again without yourarchives annals infamies would you have been he recalled what to this he had gravely returned i might havebeen in a somewhat better pecuniary situation but his actualsituation under the head in question positively so littlemattered to them that having by that time lived deep into thesense of his advantage he had kept no impression of the girl srejoinder it had but sweetened the waters in which he nowfloated tinted them as by the action of some essence pouredfrom a gold topped phial for making one s bath aromatic no onebefore him never not even the infamous pope had so sat up tohis neck in such a bath it showed for that matter how littleone of his race could escape after all from history what wasit but history and of their kind very much to have theassurance of the enjoyment of more money than the palace builderhimself could have dreamed of this was the element that borehim up and into which maggie scattered on occasion herexquisite colouring drops they were of the colour of what onearth of what but the extraordinary american good faith theywere of the colour of her innocence and yet at the same time ofher imagination with which their relation his and thesepeople s was all suffused what he had further said on theoccasion of which we thus represent him as catching the echoesfrom his own thoughts while he loitered what he had further saidcame back to him for it had been the voice itself of his luck the soothing sound that was always with him you americans arealmost incredibly romantic of course we are that s just what makes everything so nice forus everything he had wondered well everything that s nice at all the world the beautiful world or everything in it that is beautiful i mean we see somuch he had looked at her a moment and he well knew how she hadstruck him in respect to the beautiful world as one of thebeautiful the most beautiful things but what he had answeredwas you see too much that s what may sometimes make youdifficulties when you don t at least he had amended with afurther thought see too little but he had quite granted thathe knew what she meant and his warning perhaps was needless he had seen the follies of the romantic disposition but thereseemed somehow no follies in theirs nothing one was obliged torecognise but innocent pleasures pleasures without penalties their enjoyment was a tribute to others without being a loss tothemselves only the funny thing he had respectfully submitted was that her father though older and wiser and a man into thebargain was as bad that is as good as herself oh he s better the girl had freely declared that is he sworse his relation to the things he cares for and i think itbeautiful is absolutely romantic so is his whole life overhere it s the most romantic thing i know you mean his idea for his native place yes the collection the museum with which he wishes to endowit and of which he thinks more as you know than of anything inthe world it s the work of his life and the motive of everythinghe does the young man in his actual mood could have smiled again smiled delicately as he had then smiled at her has it been hismotive in letting me have you yes my dear positively or in a manner she had said american city isn t by the way his native town for thoughhe s not old it s a young thing compared with him a youngerone he started there he has a feeling about it and the placehas grown as he says like the programme of a charityperformance you re at any rate a part of his collection shehad explained one of the things that can only be got overhere you re a rarity an object of beauty an object of price you re not perhaps absolutely unique but you re so curious andeminent that there are very few others like you you belong to aclass about which everything is known you re what they call amorceau de musee i see i have the great sign of it he had risked that i costa lot of money i haven t the least idea she had gravely answered what youcost and he had quite adored for the moment her way of sayingit he had felt even for the moment vulgar but he had made thebest of that wouldn t you find out if it were a question ofparting with me my value would in that case be estimated she had looked at him with her charming eyes as if his valuewere well before her yes if you mean that i d pay rather thanlose you and then there came again what this had made him say don t talkabout me it s you who are not of this age you re a creature ofa braver and finer one and the cinquecento at its most goldenhour wouldn t have been ashamed of you it would of me and if ididn t know some of the pieces your father has acquired i shouldrather fear for american city the criticism of experts wouldit at all events be your idea he had then just ruefully asked to send me there for safety well we may have to come to it i ll go anywhere you want we must see first it will be only if we have to come to it there are things she had gone on that father puts away thebigger and more cumbrous of course which he stores has alreadystored in masses here and in paris in italy in spain inwarehouses vaults banks safes wonderful secret places we vebeen like a pair of pirates positively stage pirates the sortwho wink at each other and say ha ha when they come to wheretheir treasure is buried ours is buried pretty well everywhere except what we like to see what we travel with and have aboutus these the smaller pieces are the things we take out andarrange as we can to make the hotels we stay at and the houseswe hire a little less ugly of course it s a danger and we haveto keep watch but father loves a fine piece loves as he says the good of it and it s for the company of some of his thingsthat he s willing to run his risks and we ve had extraordinaryluck maggie had made that point we ve never lost anythingyet and the finest objects are often the smallest values inlots of cases you must know have nothing to do with size butthere s nothing however tiny she had wound up that we vemissed i like the class he had laughed for this in which you placeme i shall be one of the little pieces that you unpack at thehotels or at the worst in the hired houses like this wonderfulone and put out with the family photographs and the newmagazines but it s something not to be so big that i have to beburied oh she had returned you shall not be buried my dear tillyou re dead unless indeed you call it burial to go to americancity before i pronounce i should like to see my tomb so he had had after his fashion the last word in their interchange save forthe result of an observation that had risen to his lips at thebeginning which he had then checked and which now came back tohim good bad or indifferent i hope there s one thing youbelieve about me he had sounded solemn even to himself but she had taken itgaily ah don t fix me down to one i believe things enoughabout you my dear to have a few left if most of them even goto smash i ve taken care of that i ve divided my faith intowater tight compartments we must manage not to sink you do believe i m not a hypocrite you recognise that i don tlie or dissemble or deceive is that water tight the question to which he had given a certain intensity had madeher he remembered stare an instant her colour rising as if ithad sounded to her still stranger than he had intended he hadperceived on the spot that any serious discussion of veracity ofloyalty or rather of the want of them practically took herunprepared as if it were quite new to her he had noticed itbefore it was the english the american sign that duplicity like love had to be joked about it couldn t be gone into so the note of his inquiry was well to call it nothing else premature a mistake worth making however for the almostoverdone drollery in which her answer instinctively soughtrefuge water tight the biggest compartment of all why it s the bestcabin and the main deck and the engine room and the steward spantry it s the ship itself it s the whole line it s thecaptain s table and all one s luggage one s reading for thetrip she had images like that that were drawn from steamersand trains from a familiarity with lines a command of own cars from an experience of continents and seas that he wasunable as yet to emulate from vast modern machineries andfacilities whose acquaintance he had still to make but as towhich it was part of the interest of his situation as it stoodthat he could quite without wincing feel his future likely tobristle with them it was in fact content as he was with his engagement andcharming as he thought his affianced bride his view of thatfurniture that mainly constituted our young man s romance andto an extent that made of his inward state a contrast that he wasintelligent enough to feel he was intelligent enough to feelquite humble to wish not to be in the least hard or voracious not to insist on his own side of the bargain to warn himself inshort against arrogance and greed odd enough of a truth washis sense of this last danger which may illustrate moreover hisgeneral attitude toward dangers from within personally heconsidered he hadn t the vices in question and that wasso much to the good his race on the other hand had had themhandsomely enough and he was somehow full of his race itspresence in him was like the consciousness of some inexpugnablescent in which his clothes his whole person his hands and thehair of his head might have been steeped as in some chemicalbath the effect was nowhere in particular yet he constantlyfelt himself at the mercy of the cause he knew his antenatalhistory knew it in every detail and it was a thing to keepcauses well before him what was his frank judgment of so much ofits ugliness he asked himself but a part of the cultivation ofhumility what was this so important step he had just taken butthe desire for some new history that should so far as possible contradict and even if need be flatly dishonour the old ifwhat had come to him wouldn t do he must make somethingdifferent he perfectly recognised always in his humility thatthe material for the making had to be mr verver s millions there was nothing else for him on earth to make it with he hadtried before had had to look about and see the truth humble ashe was at the same time he was not so humble as if he had knownhimself frivolous or stupid he had an idea which may amuse hishistorian that when you were stupid enough to be mistaken aboutsuch a matter you did know it therefore he wasn t mistaken hisfuture might be might be scientific there was nothing inhimself at all events to prevent it he was allying himself toscience for it was science but the absence of prejudice backedby the presence of money his life would be full of machinery which was the antidote to superstition which was in its turn too much the consequence or at least the exhalation ofarchives he thought of these of his not being at all eventsfutile and of his absolute acceptance of the developments of thecoming age to redress the balance of his being so differentlyconsidered the moments when he most winced were those at whichhe found himself believing that really futility would have beenforgiven him even with it in that absurd view he would havebeen good enough such was the laxity in the ververs of theromantic spirit they didn t indeed poor dears know what inthat line the line of futility the real thing meant he did having seen it having tried it having taken its measure thiswas a memory in fact simply to screen out much as just in frontof him while he walked the iron shutter of a shop closing earlyto the stale summer day rattled down at the turn of some crank there was machinery again just as the plate glass all abouthim was money was power the power of the rich peoples well he was of them now of the rich peoples he was on their side ifit wasn t rather the pleasanter way of putting it that they wereon his something of this sort was in any case the moral and the murmurof his walk it would have been ridiculous such a moral fromsuch a source if it hadn t all somehow fitted to the gravity ofthe hour that gravity the oppression of which i began byrecording another feature was the immediate nearness of thearrival of the contingent from home he was to meet them atcharing cross on the morrow his younger brother who had marriedbefore him but whose wife of hebrew race with a portion thathad gilded the pill was not in a condition to travel his sisterand her husband the most anglicised of milanesi his maternaluncle the most shelved of diplomatists and his roman cousin don ottavio the most disponible of ex deputies and ofrelatives a scant handful of the consanguineous who in spite ofmaggie s plea for hymeneal reserve were to accompany him to thealtar it was no great array yet it was apparently to be a morenumerous muster than any possible to the bride herself havingno wealth of kinship to choose from and making it up on theother hand by loose invitations he had been interested in thegirl s attitude on the matter and had wholly deferred to it giving him as it did a glimpse distinctly pleasing of thekind of ruminations she would in general be governed by whichwere quite such as fell in with his own taste they hadn tnatural relations she and her father she had explained so theywouldn t try to supply the place by artificial by make believeones by any searching of highways and hedges oh yes they hadacquaintances enough but a marriage was an intimate thing youasked acquaintances when you had your kith and kin you askedthem over and above but you didn t ask them alone to cover yournudity and look like what they weren t she knew what she meantand what she liked and he was all ready to take from her finding a good omen in both of the facts he expected her desired her to have character his wife should have it and hewasn t afraid of her having much he had had in his earliertime to deal with plenty of people who had had it notably withthe three four ecclesiastics his great uncle the cardinal above all who had taken a hand and played a part in hiseducation the effect of all of which had never been to upsethim he was thus fairly on the look out for the characteristicin this most intimate as she was to come of his associates he encouraged it when it appeared he felt therefore just at present as if his papers were inorder as if his accounts so balanced as they had never done inhis life before and he might close the portfolio with a snap itwould open again doubtless of itself with the arrival of theromans it would even perhaps open with his dining to night inportland place where mr verver had pitched a tent suggestingthat of alexander furnished with the spoils of darius but whatmeanwhile marked his crisis as i have said was his sense of theimmediate two or three hours he paused on corners at crossings there kept rising for him in waves that consciousness sharp asto its source while vague as to its end which i began byspeaking of the consciousness of an appeal to do something orother before it was too late for himself by any friend to whomhe might have mentioned it the appeal could have been turned tofrank derision for what for whom indeed but himself and thehigh advantages attached was he about to marry anextraordinarily charming girl whose prospects of the solidsort were as guaranteed as her amiability he wasn t to do it assuredly all for her the prince as happened however was sofree to feel and yet not to formulate that there rose before himafter a little definitely the image of a friend whom he hadoften found ironic he withheld the tribute of attention frompassing faces only to let his impulse accumulate youth andbeauty made him scarcely turn but the image of mrs assinghammade him presently stop a hansom her youth her beauty werethings more or less of the past but to find her at home as hepossibly might would be doing what he still had time for would put something of a reason into his restlessness and therebyprobably soothe it to recognise the propriety of this particularpilgrimage she lived far enough off in long cadogan place wasalready in fact to work it off a little a perception of thepropriety of formally thanking her and of timing the act just ashe happened to be doing this he made out as he went wasobviously all that had been the matter with him it was true thathe had mistaken the mood of the moment misread it rather superficially as an impulse to look the other way the other wayfrom where his pledges had accumulated mrs assingham precisely represented embodied his pledges was in herpleasant person the force that had set them successively inmotion she had made his marriage quite as truly as his papalancestor had made his family though he could scarce see what shehad made it for unless because she too was perversely romantic he had neither bribed nor persuaded her had given her nothing scarce even till now articulate thanks so that her profit tothink of it vulgarly must have all had to come from the ververs yet he was far he could still remind himself from supposingthat she had been grossly remunerated he was wholly sure shehadn t for if there were people who took presents and people whodidn t she would be quite on the right side and of the proudclass only then on the other hand her disinterestedness wasrather awful it implied that is such abysses of confidence she was admirably attached to maggie whose possession of such afriend might moreover quite rank as one of her assets but thegreat proof of her affection had been in bringing them with herdesign together meeting him during a winter in rome meetinghim afterwards in paris and liking him as she had in timefrankly let him know from the first she had marked him for heryoung friend s own and had then unmistakably presented him in alight but the interest in maggie that was the point would haveachieved but little without her interest in him on what did thatsentiment unsolicited and unrecompensed rest what good again for it was much like his question about mr verver shouldhe ever have done her the prince s notion of a recompense towomen similar in this to his notion of an appeal was more orless to make love to them now he hadn t as he believed madelove the least little bit to mrs assingham nor did he think shehad for a moment supposed it he liked in these days to markthem off the women to whom he hadn t made love it represented and that was what pleased him in it a different stage ofexistence from the time at which he liked to mark off the womento whom he had neither with all this had mrs assinghamherself been either aggressive or resentful on what occasion ever had she appeared to find him wanting these things themotives of such people were obscure a little alarmingly so they contributed to that element of the impenetrable which aloneslightly qualified his sense of his good fortune he rememberedto have read as a boy a wonderful tale by allan poe hisprospective wife s countryman which was a thing to show by theway what imagination americans could have the story of theshipwrecked gordon pym who drifting in a small boat furthertoward the north pole or was it the south than anyone had everdone found at a given moment before him a thickness of white airthat was like a dazzling curtain of light concealing as darknessconceals yet of the colour of milk or of snow there weremoments when he felt his own boat move upon some such mystery the state of mind of his new friends including mrs assinghamherself had resemblances to a great white curtain he had neverknown curtains but as purple even to blackness but as producingwhere they hung a darkness intended and ominous when they wereso disposed as to shelter surprises the surprises were apt to beshocks shocks however from these quite different depths were not whathe saw reason to apprehend what he rather seemed to himself notyet to have measured was something that seeking a name for it he would have called the quantity of confidence reposed in him he had stood still at many a moment of the previous month withthe thought freshly determined or renewed of the generalexpectation to define it roughly of which he was the subject what was singular was that it seemed not so much an expectationof anything in particular as a large bland blank assumption ofmerits almost beyond notation of essential quality and value itwas as if he had been some old embossed coin of a purity of goldno longer used stamped with glorious arms mediaeval wonderful of which the worth in mere modern change sovereigns and halfcrowns would be great enough but as to which since there werefiner ways of using it such taking to pieces was superfluous that was the image for the security in which it was open to himto rest he was to constitute a possession yet was to escapebeing reduced to his component parts what would this mean butthat practically he was never to be tried or tested what wouldit mean but that if they didn t change him they reallywouldn t know he wouldn t know himself how many pounds shillings and pence he had to give these at any rate for thepresent were unanswerable questions all that was before him wasthat he was invested with attributes he was taken seriously lost there in the white mist was the seriousness in them thatmade them so take him it was even in mrs assingham in spite ofher having as she had frequently shown a more mocking spirit all he could say as yet was that he had done nothing so far asto break any charm what should he do if he were to ask herfrankly this afternoon what was morally speaking behind theirveil it would come to asking what they expected him to do shewould answer him probably oh you know it s what we expect youto be on which he would have no resource but to deny hisknowledge would that break the spell his saying he had no idea what idea in fact could he have he also took himself seriously made a point of it but it wasn t simply a question of fancy andpretension his own estimate he saw ways at one time andanother of dealing with but theirs sooner or later say whatthey might would put him to the practical proof as thepractical proof accordingly would naturally be proportionate tothe cluster of his attributes one arrived at a scale that he wasnot honestly the man to calculate who but a billionaire couldsay what was fair exchange for a billion that measure was theshrouded object but he felt really as his cab stopped incadogan place a little nearer the shroud he promised himself virtually to give the latter a twitch ii they re not good days you know he had said to fanny assinghamafter declaring himself grateful for finding her and then withhis cup of tea putting her in possession of the latest news thedocuments signed an hour ago de part et d autre and thetelegram from his backers who had reached paris the morningbefore and who pausing there a little poor dears seemed tothink the whole thing a tremendous lark we re very simple folk mere country cousins compared with you he had also observed and paris for my sister and her husband is the end of theworld london therefore will be more or less another planet ithas always been as with so many of us quite their mecca butthis is their first real caravan they ve mainly known oldengland as a shop for articles in india rubber and leather inwhich they ve dressed themselves as much as possible which allmeans however that you ll see them all of them wreathed insmiles we must be very easy with them maggie s too wonderful her preparations are on a scale she insists on taking in thesposi and my uncle the others will come to me i ve beenengaging their rooms at the hotel and with all those solemnsignatures of an hour ago that brings the case home to me do you mean you re afraid his hostess had amusedly asked terribly afraid i ve now but to wait to see the monster come they re not good days they re neither one thing nor the other i ve really got nothing yet i ve everything to lose one doesn tknow what still may happen the way she laughed at him was for an instant almost irritating it came out for his fancy from behind the white curtain it wasa sign that is of her deep serenity which worried instead ofsoothing him and to be soothed after all to be tided over inhis mystic impatience to be told what he could understand andbelieve that was what he had come for marriage then saidmrs assingham is what you call the monster i admit it s afearful thing at the best but for heaven s sake if that s whatyou re thinking of don t run away from it ah to run away from it would be to run away from you theprince replied and i ve already told you often enough how idepend on you to see me through he so liked the way she tookthis from the corner of her sofa that he gave his sincerity for it was sincerity fuller expression i m starting on thegreat voyage across the unknown sea my ship s all rigged andappointed the cargo s stowed away and the company complete butwhat seems the matter with me is that i can t sail alone my shipmust be one of a pair must have in the waste of waters a whatdo you call it a consort i don t ask you to stay on board withme but i must keep your sail in sight for orientation i don tin the least myself know i assure you the points of thecompass but with a lead i can perfectly follow you must be mylead how can you be sure she asked where i should take you why from your having brought me safely thus far i should neverhave got here without you you ve provided the ship itself and if you ve not quite seen me aboard you ve attended me ever sokindly to the dock your own vessel is all conveniently in thenext berth and you can t desert me now she showed him again her amusement which struck him even asexcessive as if to his surprise he made her also a littlenervous she treated him in fine as if he were not utteringtruths but making pretty figures for her diversion my vessel dear prince she smiled what vessel in the world have i this little house is all our ship bob s and mine andthankful we are now to have it we ve wandered far living asyou may say from hand to mouth without rest for the soles ofour feet but the time has come for us at last to draw in he made at this the young man an indignant protest you talkabout rest it s too selfish when you re just launching me onadventures she shook her head with her kind lucidity not adventures heaven forbid you ve had yours as i ve had mine and my ideahas been all along that we should neither of us begin again myown last precisely has been doing for you all you so prettilymention but it consists simply in having conducted you to rest you talk about ships but they re not the comparison yourtossings are over you re practically in port the port sheconcluded of the golden isles he looked about to put himself more in relation with the place then after an hesitation seemed to speak certain words insteadof certain others oh i know where i am i do decline to beleft but what i came for of course was to thank you if to dayhas seemed for the first time the end of preliminaries i feelhow little there would have been any at all without you thefirst were wholly yours well said mrs assingham they were remarkably easy i veseen them i ve had them she smiled more difficult everything you must feel went of itself so you must feel everything still goes the prince quickly agreed oh beautifully but you had theconception ah prince so had you he looked at her harder a moment you had it first you had itmost she returned his look as if it had made her wonder i liked it if that s what you mean but you liked it surely yourself iprotest that i had easy work with you i had only at last wheni thought it was time to speak for you all that is quite true but you re leaving me all the same you re leaving me you re washing your hands of me he went on however that won t be easy i won t be left and he had turnedhis eyes about again taking in the pretty room that she had justdescribed as her final refuge the place of peace for a world worn couple to which she had lately retired with bob i shallkeep this spot in sight say what you will i shall need you i mnot you know he declared going to give you up for anybody if you re afraid which of course you re not are you trying tomake me the same she asked after a moment he waited a minute too then answered her with a question yousay you liked it your undertaking to make my engagementpossible it remains beautiful for me that you did it s charmingand unforgettable but still more it s mysterious andwonderful why you dear delightful woman did you like it i scarce know what to make she said of such an inquiry ifyou haven t by this time found out yourself what meaning cananything i say have for you don t you really after all feel she added while nothing came from him aren t you consciousevery minute of the perfection of the creature of whom i ve putyou into possession every minute gratefully conscious but that s exactly theground of my question it wasn t only a matter of your handing meover it was a matter of your handing her it was a matter of herfate still more than of mine you thought all the good of herthat one woman can think of another and yet by your account you enjoyed assisting at her risk she had kept her eyes on him while he spoke and this was what visibly determined a repetition for her are you trying tofrighten me ah that s a foolish view i should be too vulgar youapparently can t understand either my good faith or my humility i m awfully humble the young man insisted that s the way i vebeen feeling to day with everything so finished and ready andyou won t take me for serious she continued to face him as if he really troubled her a little oh you deep old italians there you are he returned it s what i wanted you to come to that s the responsible note yes she went on if you re humble you must be dangerous she had a pause while he only smiled then she said i don t inthe least want to lose sight of you but even if i did ishouldn t think it right thank you for that it s what i needed of you i m sure afterall that the more you re with me the more i shall understand it s the only thing in the world i want i m excellent i reallythink all round except that i m stupid i can do pretty wellanything i see but i ve got to see it first and he pursued hisdemonstration i don t in the least mind its having to be shownme in fact i like that better therefore it is that i want thati shall always want your eyes through them i wish to look evenat any risk of their showing me what i mayn t like for then hewound up i shall know and of that i shall never be afraid she might quite have been waiting to see what he would come to but she spoke with a certain impatience what on earth are youtalking about but he could perfectly say of my real honest fear of being off some day of being wrong without knowing it that s what ishall always trust you for to tell me when i am no with youpeople it s a sense we haven t got it not as you have therefore but he had said enough ecco he simply smiled it was not to be concealed that he worked upon her but of courseshe had always liked him i should be interested she presentlyremarked to see some sense you don t possess well he produced one on the spot the moral dear mrs assingham i mean always as you others consider it i ve ofcourse something that in our poor dear backward old romesufficiently passes for it but it s no more like yours than thetortuous stone staircase half ruined into the bargain in somecastle of our quattrocento is like the lightning elevator inone of mr verver s fifteen storey buildings your moral senseworks by steam it sends you up like a rocket ours is slow andsteep and unlighted with so many of the steps missing that well that it s as short in almost any case to turn round andcome down again trusting mrs assingham smiled to get up some other way yes or not to have to get up at all however he added itold you that at the beginning machiavelli she simply exclaimed you do me too much honour i wish indeed i had his genius however if you really believe i have his perversity you wouldn tsay it but it s all right he gaily enough concluded i shallalways have you to come to on this for a little they sat face to face after which without comment she asked him if he would have more tea all shewould give him he promptly signified and he developed makingher laugh his idea that the tea of the english race was somehowtheir morality made with boiling water in a little pot sothat the more of it one drank the more moral one would become his drollery served as a transition and she put to him severalquestions about his sister and the others questions as to whatbob in particular colonel assingham her husband could do forthe arriving gentlemen whom by the prince s leave he wouldimmediately go to see he was funny while they talked abouthis own people too whom he described with anecdotes of theirhabits imitations of their manners and prophecies of theirconduct as more rococo than anything cadogan place would everhave known this mrs assingham professed was exactly whatwould endear them to her and that in turn drew from hervisitor a fresh declaration of all the comfort of his being ableso to depend on her he had been with her at this point sometwenty minutes but he had paid her much longer visits and hestayed now as if to make his attitude prove his appreciation hestayed moreover that was really the sign of the hour in spiteof the nervous unrest that had brought him and that had in truthmuch rather fed on the scepticism by which she had apparentlymeant to soothe it she had not soothed him and there arrived remarkably a moment when the cause of her failure gleamed out he had not frightened her as she called it he felt that yetshe was herself not at ease she had been nervous though tryingto disguise it the sight of him following on the announcementof his name had shown her as disconcerted this conviction forthe young man deepened and sharpened yet with the effect too of making him glad in spite of it it was as if in calling hehad done even better than he intended for it was somehowimportant that was what it was that there should be at thishour something the matter with mrs assingham with whom in alltheir acquaintance so considerable now there had never been theleast little thing the matter to wait thus and watch for it wasto know of a truth that there was something the matter withhim since strangely with so little to go upon his heart hadpositively begun to beat to the tune of suspense it fairlybefell at last for a climax that they almost ceased topretend to pretend that is to cheat each other with forms theunspoken had come up and there was a crisis neither could havesaid how long it lasted during which they were reduced for allinterchange to looking at each other on quite an inordinatescale they might at this moment in their positively portentousstillness have been keeping it up for a wager sitting for theirphotograph or even enacting a tableau vivant the spectator of whom they would thus well have been worthy mighthave read meanings of his own into the intensity of theircommunion or indeed even without meanings have found hisaccount aesthetically in some gratified play of our modernsense of type so scantly to be distinguished from our modernsense of beauty type was there at the worst in mrs assingham s dark neat head on which the crisp black hair madewaves so fine and so numerous that she looked even more in thefashion of the hour than she desired full of discriminationsagainst the obvious she had yet to accept a flagrant appearanceand to make the best of misleading signs her richness of hue her generous nose her eyebrows marked like those of an actress these things with an added amplitude of person on which middleage had set its seal seemed to present her insistently as adaughter of the south or still more of the east a creatureformed by hammocks and divans fed upon sherbets and waited uponby slaves she looked as if her most active effort might be totake up as she lay back her mandolin or to share a sugaredfruit with a pet gazelle she was in fact however neither apampered jewess nor a lazy creole new york had been recordedly her birthplace and europe punctually her discipline she woreyellow and purple because she thought it better as she said while one was about it to look like the queen of sheba than likea revendeuse she put pearls in her hair and crimson and gold inher tea gown for the same reason it was her theory that natureitself had overdressed her and that her only course was to drown as it was hopeless to try to chasten the overdressing so shewas covered and surrounded with things which were frankly toysand shams a part of the amusement with which she rejoiced tosupply her friends these friends were in the game that ofplaying with the disparity between her aspect and her character her character was attested by the second movement of her face which convinced the beholder that her vision of the humours ofthe world was not supine not passive she enjoyed she neededthe warm air of friendship but the eyes of the american citylooked out somehow for the opportunity of it from under thelids of jerusalem with her false indolence in short her falseleisure her false pearls and palms and courts and fountains shewas a person for whom life was multitudinous detail detail thatleft her as it at any moment found her unappalled andunwearied sophisticated as i may appear it was her frequent phrase shehad found sympathy her best resource it gave her plenty to do it made her as she also said sit up she had in her life twogreat holes to fill and she described herself as dropping socialscraps into them as she had known old ladies in her earlyamerican time drop morsels of silk into the baskets in whichthey collected the material for some eventual patchwork quilt one of these gaps in mrs assingham s completeness was her wantof children the other was her want of wealth it was wonderfulhow little either in the fulness of time came to show sympathyand curiosity could render their objects practically filial justas an english husband who in his military years had run everything in his regiment could make economy blossom like therose colonel bob had a few years after his marriage left thearmy which had clearly by that time done its laudable all forthe enrichment of his personal experience and he could thus givehis whole time to the gardening in question there reigned amongthe younger friends of this couple a legend almost too venerablefor historical criticism that the marriage itself the happiestof its class dated from the far twilight of the age a primitiveperiod when such things such things as american girls acceptedas good enough had not begun to be so that the pleasant pairhad been as to the risk taken on either side bold and original honourably marked for the evening of life as discoverers of akind of hymeneal northwest passage mrs assingham knew better knew there had been no historic hour from that of pocahontasdown when some young englishman hadn t precipitately believedand some american girl hadn t with a few more gradations availed herself to the full of her incapacity to doubt but sheaccepted resignedly the laurel of the founder since she was infact pretty well the doyenne above ground of her transplantedtribe and since above all she had invented combinations though she had not invented bob s own it was he who had donethat absolutely puzzled it out by himself from his first oddglimmer resting upon it moreover through the years to come asproof enough in him by itself of the higher cleverness if shekept her own cleverness up it was largely that he should havefull credit there were moments in truth when she privately felthow little striking out as he had done he could have affordedthat she should show the common limits but mrs assingham scleverness was in truth tested when her present visitor at lastsaid to her i don t think you know that you re treating mequite right you ve something on your mind that you don t tellme it was positive too that her smile in reply was a trifle dim am i obliged to tell you everything i have on my mind it isn t a question of everything but it s a question ofanything that may particularly concern me then you shouldn tkeep it back you know with what care i desire to proceed takingeverything into account and making no mistake that may possiblyinjure her mrs assingham at this had after an instant an oddinterrogation her her and him both our friends either maggie or her father i have something on my mind mrs assingham presently returned something has happened for which i hadn t been prepared but itisn t anything that properly concerns you the prince with immediate gaiety threw back his head what doyou mean by properly i somehow see volumes in it it s the waypeople put a thing when they put it well wrong i put thingsright what is it that has happened for me his hostess the next moment had drawn spirit from his tone oh i shall be delighted if you ll take your share of it charlotte stant is in london she has just been here miss stant oh really the prince expressed clear surprise atransparency through which his eyes met his friend s with acertain hardness of concussion she has arrived from america he then quickly asked she appears to have arrived this noon coming up fromsouthampton at an hotel she dropped upon me after luncheon andwas here for more than an hour the young man heard with interest though not with an interesttoo great for his gaiety you think then i ve a share in it what is my share why any you like the one you seemed just now eager to take itwas you yourself who insisted he looked at her on this with conscious inconsistency and shecould now see that he had changed colour but he was always easy i didn t know then what the matter was you didn t think it could be so bad do you call it very bad the young man asked only shesmiled because that s the way it seems to affect you he hesitated still with the trace of his quickened colour stilllooking at her still adjusting his manner but you allowed youwere upset to the extent yes of not having in the least looked for her any more said mrs assingham than i judge maggie to havedone the prince thought then as if glad to be able to say somethingvery natural and true no quite right maggie hasn t looked forher but i m sure he added she ll be delighted to see her that certainly and his hostess spoke with a different shadeof gravity she ll be quite overjoyed the prince went on has miss stantnow gone to her she has gone back to her hotel to bring her things here ican t have her said mrs assingham alone at an hotel no i see if she s here at all she must stay with me he quite took itin so she s coming now i expect her at any moment if you wait you ll see her oh he promptly declared charming but this word came out asif a little in sudden substitution for some other it soundedaccidental whereas he wished to be firm that accordingly waswhat he next showed himself if it wasn t for what s going onthese next days maggie would certainly want to have her infact he lucidly continued isn t what s happening just areason to make her want to mrs assingham for answer onlylooked at him and this the next instant had apparently hadmore effect than if she had spoken for he asked a question thatseemed incongruous what has she come for it made his companion laugh why for just what you say foryour marriage mine he wondered maggie s it s the same thing it s for your great event andthen said mrs assingham she s so lonely has she given you that as a reason i scarcely remember she gave me so many she abounds poordear in reasons but there s one that whatever she does ialways remember for myself and which is that he looked as if he ought to guess butcouldn t why the fact that she has no home absolutely none whatever she s extraordinarily alone again he took it in and also has no great means very small ones which is not however with the expense ofrailways and hotels a reason for her running to and fro on the contrary but she doesn t like her country hers my dear man it s little enough hers the attribution for the moment amused his hostess she has rebounded now butshe has had little enough else to do with it oh i say hers the prince pleasantly explained very much as at this time of day i might say mine i quite feel i assureyou as if the great place already more or less belonged to me that s your good fortune and your point of view you own or yousoon practically will own so much of it charlotte owns almostnothing in the world she tells me but two colossal trunks onlyone of which i have given her leave to introduce into this house she ll depreciate to you mrs assingham added your property he thought of these things he thought of every thing but he hadalways his resource at hand of turning all to the easy has shecome with designs upon me and then in a moment as if even thiswere almost too grave he sounded the note that had least to dowith himself est elle toujours aussi belle that was thefurthest point somehow to which charlotte stant could berelegated mrs assingham treated it freely just the same the person inthe world to my sense whose looks are most subject toappreciation it s all in the way she affects you one admiresher if one doesn t happen not to so as well one criticisesher ah that s not fair said the prince to criticise her then there you are you re answered i m answered he took it humorously as his lesson sank hisprevious self consciousness with excellent effect in gratefuldocility i only meant that there are perhaps better things tobe done with miss stant than to criticise her when once youbegin that with anyone he was vague and kind i quite agree that it s better to keep out of it as long as onecan but when one must do it yes he asked as she paused then know what you mean i see perhaps he smiled i don t know what i mean well it s what just now in all ways you particularly shouldknow mrs assingham however made no more of this having before anything else apparently a scruple about the tone shehad just used i quite understand of course that given hergreat friendship with maggie she should have wanted to bepresent she has acted impulsively but she has actedgenerously she has acted beautifully said the prince i say generously because i mean she hasn t in any way counted the cost she ll have it to count in a manner now hishostess continued but that doesn t matter he could see how little you ll look after her i ll look after her so it s all right it s all right said mrs assingham then why are youtroubled it pulled her up but only for a minute i m not any more thanyou the prince s dark blue eyes were of the finest and on occasion precisely resembled nothing so much as the high windows of aroman palace of an historic front by one of the great olddesigners thrown open on a feast day to the golden air his lookitself at such times suggested an image that of some verynoble personage who expected acclaimed by the crowd in thestreet and with old precious stuffs falling over the sill for hissupport had gaily and gallantly come to show himself alwaysmoreover less in his own interest than in that of spectators andsubjects whose need to admire even to gape was periodically tobe considered the young man s expression became after thisfashion something vivid and concrete a beautiful personalpresence that of a prince in very truth a ruler warrior patron lighting up brave architecture and diffusing the sense ofa function it had been happily said of his face that the figurethus appearing in the great frame was the ghost of some proudestancestor whoever the ancestor now at all events the princewas for mrs assingham s benefit in view of the people heseemed leaning on crimson damask to take in the bright day helooked younger than his years he was beautiful innocent vague oh well i m not he rang out clear i should like to see you sir she said for you wouldn t havea shadow of excuse he showed how he agreed that he would havebeen at a loss for one and the fact of their serenity was thusmade as important as if some danger of its opposite had directlymenaced them the only thing was that if the evidence of theircheer was so established mrs assingham had a little to explainher original manner and she came to this before they dropped thequestion my first impulse is always to behave abouteverything as if i feared complications but i don t fear them i really like them they re quite my element he deferred for her to this account of herself but still he said if we re not in the presence of a complication she hesitated a handsome clever odd girl staying with one isalways a complication the young man weighed it almost as if the question were new tohim and will she stay very long his friend gave a laugh how in the world can i know i vescarcely asked her ah yes you can t but something in the tone of it amused her afresh do you thinkyou could i he wondered do you think you could get it out of her for me the probablelength of her stay he rose bravely enough to the occasion and the challenge idaresay if you were to give me the chance here it is then for you she answered for she had heard within the minute the stop of a cab at her door she s back iiiit had been said as a joke but as after this they awaitedtheir friend in silence the effect of the silence was to turnthe time to gravity a gravity not dissipated even when theprince next spoke he had been thinking the case over and makingup his mind a handsome clever odd girl staying with one was acomplication mrs assingham so far was right but there werethe facts the good relations from schooldays of the two youngwomen and the clear confidence with which one of them hadarrived she can come you know at any time to us mrs assingham took it up with an irony beyond laughter you dlike her for your honeymoon oh no you must keep her for that but why not after she had looked at him a minute then at the sound of a voice inthe corridor they had got up why not you re splendid charlotte stant the next minute was with them ushered in asshe had alighted from her cab and prepared for not finding mrs assingham alone this would have been to be noticed by thebutler s answer on the stairs to a question put to him shecould have looked at her hostess with such straightness andbrightness only from knowing that the prince was also there thediscrimination of but a moment yet which let him take her instill better than if she had instantly faced him he availedhimself of the chance thus given him for he was conscious of allthese things what he accordingly saw for some seconds withintensity was a tall strong charming girl who wore for him atfirst exactly the look of her adventurous situation asuggestion in all her person in motion and gesture in free vivid yet altogether happy indications of dress from thebecoming compactness of her hat to the shade of tan in her shoes of winds and waves and custom houses of far countries and longjourneys the knowledge of how and where and the habit foundedon experience of not being afraid he was aware at the sametime that of this combination the strongminded note was not as might have been apprehended the basis he was nowsufficiently familiar with english speaking types he had soundedattentively enough such possibilities for a quick vision ofdifferences he had besides his own view of this young lady sstrength of mind it was great he had ground to believe but itwould never interfere with the play of her extremely personal her always amusing taste this last was the thing in her for shethrew it out positively on the spot like a light that shemight have reappeared during these moments just to cool hisworried eyes with he saw her in her light that immediate exclusive address to their friend was like a lamp she was holdingaloft for his benefit and for his pleasure it showed himeverything above all her presence in the world so closely soirretrievably contemporaneous with his own a sharp sharp fact sharper during these instants than any other at all even thanthat of his marriage but accompanied in a subordinate andcontrolled way with those others facial physiognomic thatmrs assingham had been speaking of as subject to appreciation so they were these others as he met them again and that wasthe connection they instantly established with him if they hadto be interpreted this made at least for intimacy there was butone way certainly for him to interpret them in the sense of thealready known making use then of clumsy terms of excess the face was toonarrow and too long the eyes not large and the mouth on theother hand by no means small with substance in its lips and aslight the very slightest tendency to protrusion in the solidteeth otherwise indeed well arrayed and flashingly white but itwas strangely as a cluster of possessions of his own that thesethings in charlotte stant now affected him items in a fulllist items recognised each of them as if for the longinterval they had been stored wrapped up numbered put awayin a cabinet while she faced mrs assingham the door of thecabinet had opened of itself he took the relics out one by one and it was more and more each instant as if she were giving himtime he saw again that her thick hair was vulgarly speaking brown but that there was a shade of tawny autumn leaf in it for appreciation a colour indescribable and of which he had knownno other case something that gave her at moments the sylvanhead of a huntress he saw the sleeves of her jacket drawn to herwrists but he again made out the free arms within them to be ofthe completely rounded the polished slimness that florentinesculptors in the great time had loved and of which theapparent firmness is expressed in their old silver and oldbronze he knew her narrow hands he knew her long fingers andthe shape and colour of her finger nails he knew her specialbeauty of movement and line when she turned her back and theperfect working of all her main attachments that of somewonderful finished instrument something intently made forexhibition for a prize he knew above all the extraordinaryfineness of her flexible waist the stem of an expanded flower which gave her a likeness also to some long loose silk purse well filled with gold pieces but having been passed empty through a finger ring that held it together it was as if beforeshe turned to him he had weighed the whole thing in his openpalm and even heard a little the chink of the metal when shedid turn to him it was to recognise with her eyes what he mighthave been doing she made no circumstance of thus coming uponhim save so far as the intelligence in her face could at anymoment make a circumstance of almost anything if when she movedoff she looked like a huntress she looked when she came nearerlike his notion perhaps not wholly correct of a muse but whatshe said was simply you see you re not rid of me how is dearmaggie it was to come soon enough by the quite unforced operation ofchance the young man s opportunity to ask her the questionsuggested by mrs assingham shortly before her entrance thelicense had he chosen to embrace it was within a few minutesall there the license given him literally to inquire of thisyoung lady how long she was likely to be with them for a matterof the mere domestic order had quickly determined on mrs assingham s part a withdrawal of a few moments which had theeffect of leaving her visitors free mrs betterman s there she had said to charlotte in allusion to some member of thehousehold who was to have received her and seen her belongingssettled to which charlotte had replied that she had encounteredonly the butler who had been quite charming she had deprecatedany action taken on behalf of her effects but her hostess rebounding from accumulated cushions evidently saw more in mrs betterman s non appearance than could meet the casual eye whatshe saw in short demanded her intervention in spite of anearnest let me go from the girl and a prolonged smiling wailover the trouble she was giving the prince was quite aware atthis moment that departure for himself was indicated thequestion of miss stant s installation didn t demand his presence it was a case for one to go away if one hadn t a reason forstaying he had a reason however of that he was equally aware and he had not for a good while done anything more conscious andintentional than not quickly to take leave his visibleinsistence for it came to that even demanded of him a certaindisagreeable effort the sort of effort he had mostly associatedwith acting for an idea his idea was there his idea was to findout something something he wanted much to know and to find itout not tomorrow not at some future time not in short withwaiting and wondering but if possible before quitting the place this particular curiosity moreover confounded itself a littlewith the occasion offered him to satisfy mrs assingham s own hewouldn t have admitted that he was staying to ask a rudequestion there was distinctly nothing rude in his having hisreasons it would be rude for that matter to turn one s back without a word or two on an old friend well as it came to pass he got the word or two for mrs assingham s preoccupation was practically simplifying the littlecrisis was of shorter duration than our account of it duration naturally would have forced him to take up his hat he wassomehow glad on finding himself alone with charlotte that hehad not been guilty of that inconsequence not to be flurried wasthe kind of consistency he wanted just as consistency was thekind of dignity and why couldn t he have dignity when he had somuch of the good conscience as it were on which such advantagesrested he had done nothing he oughtn t he had in fact donenothing at all once more as a man conscious of having knownmany women he could assist as he would have called it at therecurrent the predestined phenomenon the thing always ascertain as sunrise or the coming round of saints days the doingby the woman of the thing that gave her away she did it ever inevitably infallibly she couldn t possibly not do it it washer nature it was her life and the man could always expect itwithout lifting a finger this was his the man s any man s position and strength that he had necessarily the advantage that he only had to wait with a decent patience to be placed in spite of himself it might really be said in the right justso the punctuality of performance on the part of the othercreature was her weakness and her deep misfortune not less nodoubt than her beauty it produced for the man thatextraordinary mixture of pity and profit in which his relationwith her when he was not a mere brute mainly consisted andgave him in fact his most pertinent ground of being always niceto her nice about her nice for her she always dressed her actup of course she muffled and disguised and arranged it showingin fact in these dissimulations a cleverness equal to but onething in the world equal to her abjection she would let it beknown for anything for everything but the truth of which it wasmade that was what precisely charlotte stant would be doingnow that was the present motive and support to a certainty ofeach of her looks and motions she was the twentieth woman shewas possessed by her doom but her doom was also to arrangeappearances and what now concerned him was to learn how sheproposed he would help her would arrange with her to any pointin reason the only thing was to know what appearance could bestbe produced and best be preserved produced and preserved on herpart of course since on his own there had been luckily no follyto cover up nothing but a perfect accord between conduct andobligation they stood there together at all events when the door hadclosed behind their friend with a conscious strained smile andvery much as if each waited for the other to strike the note orgive the pitch the young man held himself in his silentsuspense only not more afraid because he felt her own fear shewas afraid of herself however whereas to his gain of lucidity he was afraid only of her would she throw herself into his arms or would she be otherwise wonderful she would see what he woulddo so their queer minute without words told him and she wouldact accordingly but what could he do but just let her see thathe would make anything everything for her as honourably easyas possible even if she should throw herself into his arms hewould make that easy easy that is to overlook to ignore notto remember and not by the same token either to regret thiswas not what in fact happened though it was also not at a singletouch but by the finest gradations that his tension subsided it s too delightful to be back she said at last and it wasall she definitely gave him being moreover nothing but whatanyone else might have said yet with two or three other thingsthat on his response followed it it quite pointed the path while the tone of it and her whole attitude were as far removedas need have been from the truth of her situation the abjectionthat was present to him as of the essence quite failed to peepout and he soon enough saw that if she was arranging she couldbe trusted to arrange good it was all he asked and all themore that he could admire and like her for it the particular appearance she would as they said go in for wasthat of having no account whatever to give him it would be infact that of having none to give anybody of reasons or ofmotives of comings or of goings she was a charming young womanwho had met him before but she was also a charming young womanwith a life of her own she would take it high up up up everso high well then he would do the same no height would be toogreat for them not even the dizziest conceivable to a youngperson so subtle the dizziest seemed indeed attained when afteranother moment she came as near as she was to come to an apologyfor her abruptness i ve been thinking of maggie and at last i yearned for her iwanted to see her happy and it doesn t strike me i find you tooshy to tell me i shall of course she s happy thank god only it s almost terrible youknow the happiness of young good generous creatures it ratherfrightens one but the blessed virgin and all the saints saidthe prince have her in their keeping certainly they have she s the dearest of the dear but ineedn t tell you the girl added ah he returned with gravity i feel that i ve still much tolearn about her to which he subjoined she ll rejoice awfullyin your being with us oh you don t need me charlotte smiled it s her hour it s agreat hour one has seen often enough with girls what it is but that she said is exactly why why i ve wanted i mean not to miss it he bent on her a kind comprehending face you mustn t missanything he had got it the pitch and he could keep it now for all he had needed was to have it given him the pitch was thehappiness of his wife that was to be the sight of that happinessas a joy for an old friend it was yes magnificent and not theless so for its coming to him suddenly as sincere as noblyexalted something in charlotte s eyes seemed to tell him this seemed to plead with him in advance as to what he was to find init he was eager and he tried to show her that too to find whatshe liked mindful as he easily could be of what the friendshiphad been for maggie it had been armed with the wings of youngimagination young generosity it had been he believed alwayscounting out her intense devotion to her father the liveliestemotion she had known before the dawn of the sentiment inspiredby himself she had not to his knowledge invited the object ofit to their wedding had not thought of proposing to her for amatter of a couple of hours an arduous and expensive journey but she had kept her connected and informed from week to week in spite of preparations and absorptions oh i ve been writingto charlotte i wish you knew her better he could still hear from recent weeks this record of the fact just as he couldstill be conscious not otherwise than queerly of the gratuitouselement in maggie s wish which he had failed as yet to indicateto her older and perhaps more intelligent at any rate whyshouldn t charlotte respond and be quite free to respond tosuch fidelities with something more than mere formal goodmanners the relations of women with each other were of thestrangest it was true and he probably wouldn t have trustedhere a young person of his own race he was proceeding throughouton the ground of the immense difference difficult indeed as itmight have been to disembroil in this young person her race quality nothing in her definitely placed her she was a rare aspecial product her singleness her solitude her want of means that is her want of ramifications and other advantages contributed to enrich her somehow with an odd preciousneutrality to constitute for her so detached yet so aware asort of small social capital it was the only one she had it wasthe only one a lonely gregarious girl could have since few surely had in anything like the same degree arrived at it andsince this one indeed had compassed it but through the play ofsome gift of nature to which you could scarce give a definitename it wasn t a question of her strange sense for tongues with whichshe juggled as a conjuror at a show juggled with balls or hoopsor lighted brands it wasn t at least entirely that for he hadknown people almost as polyglot whom their accomplishment hadquite failed to make interesting he was polyglot himself forthat matter as was the case too with so many of his friends andrelations for none of whom more than for himself was itanything but a common convenience the point was that in thisyoung woman it was a beauty in itself and almost a mystery so certainly he had more than once felt in noting on her lips that rarest among the barbarians of all civil graces a perfectfelicity in the use of italian he had known strangers a few and mostly men who spoke his own language agreeably but he hadknown neither man nor woman who showed for it charlotte s almostmystifying instinct he remembered how from the first of theiracquaintance she had made no display of it quite as if english between them his english so matching with hers were theirinevitable medium he had perceived all by accident by hearingher talk before him to somebody else that they had an alternativeas good an alternative in fact as much better as the amusementfor him was greater in watching her for the slips that nevercame her account of the mystery didn t suffice her recall ofher birth in florence and florentine childhood her parents fromthe great country but themselves already of a corruptgeneration demoralised falsified polyglot well before her with the tuscan balia who was her first remembrance the servantsof the villa the dear contadini of the poder the little girlsand the other peasants of the next podere all the rather shabbybut still ever so pretty human furniture of her early time including the good sisters of the poor convent of the tuscanhills the convent shabbier than almost anything else butprettier too in which she had been kept at school till thesubsequent phase the phase of the much grander institution inparis at which maggie was to arrive terribly frightened and asa smaller girl three years before her own ending of her periodof five such reminiscences naturally gave a ground but theyhad not prevented him from insisting that some strictly civilancestor generations back and from the tuscan hills if shewould made himself felt ineffaceably in her blood and in hertone she knew nothing of the ancestor but she had taken histheory from him gracefully enough as one of the little presentsthat make friendship flourish these matters however all meltedtogether now though a sense of them was doubtless concerned notunnaturally in the next thing of the nature of a surmise thathis discretion let him articulate you haven t i rathergather particularly liked your country they would stick forthe time to their english it doesn t i fear seem particularly mine and it doesn t inthe least matter over there whether one likes it or not thatis to anyone but one s self but i didn t like it saidcharlotte stant that s not encouraging then to me is it the prince went on do you mean because you re going oh yes of course we re going i ve wanted immensely to go she hesitated but now immediately in a month or two it seems to be the new idea on which therewas something in her face as he imagined that made him say didn t maggie write to you not of your going at once but of course you must go and ofcourse you must stay charlotte was easily clear as long aspossible is that what you did he laughed you stayed as long aspossible well it seemed to me so but i hadn t interests you ll havethem on a great scale it s the country for interests saidcharlotte if i had only had a few i doubtless wouldn t haveleft it he waited an instant they were still on their feet yours thenare rather here oh mine the girl smiled they take up little room whereverthey are it determined in him the way this came from her and what itsomehow did for her it determined in him a speech that would haveseemed a few minutes before precarious and in questionable taste the lead she had given him made the difference and he felt it asreally a lift on finding an honest and natural word rise by itslicense to his lips nothing surely could be for both of them more in the note of a high bravery i ve been thinking it allthe while so probable you know that you would have seen yourway to marrying she looked at him an instant and just for these seconds hefeared for what he might have spoiled to marrying whom why some good kind clever rich american again his security hung in the balance then she was as he felt admirable i tried everyone i came across i did my best i showed i hadcome quite publicly for that perhaps i showed it too much atany rate it was no use i had to recognise it no one would haveme then she seemed to show as sorry for his having to hear ofher anything so disconcerting she pitied his feeling about it if he was disappointed she would cheer him up existence youknow all the same doesn t depend on that i mean she smiled on having caught a husband oh existence the prince vaguely commented you think i oughtto argue for more than mere existence she asked i don t seewhy my existence even reduced as much as you like to beingmerely mine should be so impossible there are things of sorts i should be able to have things i should be able to be theposition of a single woman to day is very favourable you know favourable to what why just to existence which may contain after all in one wayand another so much it may contain at the worst evenaffections affections in fact quite particularly fixed thatis on one s friends i m extremely fond of maggie for instance i quite adore her how could i adore her more if i were marriedto one of the people you speak of the prince gave a laugh you might adore him more ah but it isn t is it she asked a question of that my dear friend he returned it s always a question of doingthe best for one s self one can without injury to others hefelt by this time that they were indeed on an excellent basis sohe went on again as if to show frankly his sense of itsfirmness i venture therefore to repeat my hope that you llmarry some capital fellow and also to repeat my belief that sucha marriage will be more favourable to you as you call it thaneven the spirit of the age she looked at him at first only for answer and would haveappeared to take it with meekness had she not perhaps appeared alittle more to take it with gaiety thank you very much shesimply said but at that moment their friend was with them again it was undeniable that as she came in mrs assingham looked with a certain smiling sharpness from one of them to the other the perception of which was perhaps what led charlotte forreassurance to pass the question on the prince hopes so much ishall still marry some good person whether it worked for mrs assingham or not the prince washimself at this more than ever reassured he was safe in aword that was what it all meant and he had required to be safe he was really safe enough for almost any joke it s only heexplained to their hostess because of what miss stant has beentelling me don t we want to keep up her courage if the jokewas broad he had at least not begun it not that is as a joke which was what his companion s address to their friend made ofit she has been trying in america she says but hasn t broughtit off the tone was somehow not what mrs assingham had expected butshe made the best of it well then she replied to the youngman if you take such an interest you must bring it off and you must help dear charlotte said unperturbed as you vehelped so beautifully in such things before with which before mrs assingham could meet the appeal she had addressedherself to the prince on a matter much nearer to him your mar riage is on friday on saturday oh on friday no for what do you take us there s not a vulgaromen we re neglecting on saturday please at the oratory atthree o clock before twelve assistants exactly twelve including me it struck him he laughed you ll make the thirteenth it won tdo not said charlotte if you re going in for omens shouldyou like me to stay away dear no we ll manage we ll make the round number we ll havein some old woman they must keep them there for that don tthey mrs assingham s return had at last indicated for him hisdeparture he had possessed himself again of his hat andapproached her to take leave but he had another word forcharlotte i dine to night with mr verver have you anymessage the girl seemed to wonder a little for mr verver for maggie about her seeing you early that i know is whatshe ll like then i ll come early thanks i daresay he went on she ll send for you i mean send acarriage oh i don t require that thanks i can go for a penny can ti she asked of mrs assingham in an omnibus oh i say said the prince while mrs assingham looked at herblandly yes love and i ll give you the penny she shall get there the good lady added to their friend but charlotte as the latter took leave of her thought ofsomething else there s a great favour prince that i want toask of you i want between this and saturday to make maggie amarriage present oh i say the young man again soothingly exclaimed ah but i must she went on it s really almost for that icame back it was impossible to get in america what i wanted mrs assingham showed anxiety what is it then dear you want but the girl looked only at their companion that s what theprince if he ll be so good must help me to decide can t i mrs assingham asked help you to decide certainly darling we must talk it well over and she kept hereyes on the prince but i want him if he kindly will to go withme to look i want him to judge with me and choose that if youcan spare the hour she said is the great favour i mean he raised his eyebrows at her he wonderfully smiled what youcame back from america to ask ah certainly then i must findthe hour he wonderfully smiled but it was rather more afterall than he had been reckoning with it went somehow so littlewith the rest that directly for him it wasn t the note ofsafety it preserved this character at the best but by beingthe note of publicity quickly quickly however the note ofpublicity struck him as better than any other in another momenteven it seemed positively what he wanted for what so much aspublicity put their relation on the right footing by this appealto mrs assingham it was established as right and sheimmediately showed that such was her own understanding certainly prince she laughed you must find the hour andit was really so express a license from her as representingfriendly judgment public opinion the moral law the marginallowed a husband about to be or whatever that after observingto charlotte that should she come to portland place in the morn ing he would make a point of being there to see her and so easily arrange with her about a time he took his departure withthe absolutely confirmed impression of knowing as he put it tohimself where he was which was what he had prolonged his visitfor he was where he could stay iv i don t quite see my dear colonel assingham said to his wifethe night of charlotte s arrival i don t quite see i m boundto say why you take it even at the worst so ferociously hard it isn t your fault after all is it i ll be hanged at anyrate if it s mine the hour was late and the young lady who had disembarked atsouthampton that morning to come up by the steamer special andwho had then settled herself at an hotel only to re settleherself a couple of hours later at a private house was by thistime they might hope peacefully resting from her exploits there had been two men at dinner rather batteredbrothers in arms of his own period casually picked up by herhost the day before and when the gentlemen after the meal rejoined the ladies in the drawing room charlotte pleadingfatigue had already excused herself the beguiled warriors however had stayed till after eleven mrs assingham thoughfinally quite without illusions as she said about the militarycharacter was always beguiling to old soldiers and as thecolonel had come in before dinner only in time to dress he hadnot till this moment really been summoned to meet his companionover the situation that as he was now to learn their visitor sadvent had created for them it was actually more than midnight the servants had been sent to bed the rattle of the wheels hadceased to come in through a window still open to the august air and robert assingham had been steadily learning all the while what it thus behoved him to know but the words just quoted fromhim presented themselves for the moment as the essence of hisspirit and his attitude he disengaged he would be damned if hedidn t they were both phrases he repeatedly used hisresponsibility the simplest the sanest the most obliging ofmen he habitually indulged in extravagant language his wife hadonce told him in relation to his violence of speech that suchexcesses on his part made her think of a retired general whomshe had once seen playing with toy soldiers fighting and winningbattles carrying on sieges and annihilating enemies with littlefortresses of wood and little armies of tin her husband sexaggerated emphasis was his box of toy soldiers his militarygame it harmlessly gratified in him for his declining years the military instinct bad words when sufficiently numerous andarrayed in their might could represent battalions squadrons tremendous cannonades and glorious charges of cavalry it wasnatural it was delightful the romance and for her as well ofcamp life and of the perpetual booming of guns it was fightingto the end to the death but no one was ever killed less fortunate than she nevertheless in spite of his wealth ofexpression he had not yet found the image that described herfavourite game all he could do was practically to leave it toher emulating her own philosophy he had again and again sat uplate to discuss those situations in which her finer consciousnessabounded but he had never failed to deny that anything in life anything of hers could be a situation for himself she might bein fifty at once if she liked and it was what women did like attheir ease after all there always being when they had too muchof any some man as they were well aware to get them out hewouldn t at any price have one of any sort whatever of hisown or even be in one along with her he watched her accordingly in her favourite element very much as he hadsometimes watched at the aquarium the celebrated lady who in aslight though tight bathing suit turned somersaults and didtricks in the tank of water which looked so cold anduncomfortable to the non amphibious he listened to his companionto night while he smoked his last pipe he watched her throughher demonstration quite as if he had paid a shilling but it wastrue that this being the case he desired the value of hismoney what was it in the name of wonder that she was so benton being responsible for what did she pretend was going tohappen and what at the worst could the poor girl do evengranting she wanted to do anything what at the worst for thatmatter could she be conceived to have in her head if she had told me the moment she got here mrs assinghamreplied i shouldn t have my difficulty in finding out but shewasn t so obliging and i see no sign at all of her becoming so what s certain is that she didn t come for nothing she wants she worked it out at her leisure to see the prince again thatisn t what troubles me i mean that such a fact as a fact isn t but what i ask myself is what does she want it for what s the good of asking yourself if you know you don t know the colonel sat back at his own ease with an ankle resting onthe other knee and his eyes attentive to the good appearance ofan extremely slender foot which he kept jerking in its neatintegument of fine spun black silk and patent leather it seemedto confess this member to consciousness of military discipline everything about it being as polished and perfect as straightand tight and trim as a soldier on parade it went so far as toimply that someone or other would have got something or other confinement to barracks or suppression of pay if it hadn t beenjust as it was bob assingham was distinguished altogether by aleanness of person a leanness quite distinct from physicallaxity which might have been determined on the part of superiorpowers by views of transport and accommodation and which infact verged on the abnormal he did himself as well as hisfriends mostly knew yet remained hungrily thin with facial with abdominal cavities quite grim in their effect and with aconsequent looseness of apparel that combined with a choice ofqueer light shades and of strange straw like textures of theaspect of chinese mats provocative of wonder at his sources ofsupply suggested the habit of tropic islands a continualcane bottomed chair a governorship exercised on wide verandahs his smooth round head with the particular shade of its whitehair was like a silver pot reversed his cheekbones and thebristle of his moustache were worthy of attila the hun thehollows of his eyes were deep and darksome but the eyes withinthem were like little blue flowers plucked that morning he kneweverything that could be known about life which he regarded as for far the greater part a matter of pecuniary arrangement hiswife accused him of a want alike of moral and of intellectualreaction or rather indeed of a complete incapacity for either he never went even so far as to understand what she meant and itdidn t at all matter since he could be in spite of thelimitation a perfectly social creature the infirmities thepredicaments of men neither surprised nor shocked him andindeed which was perhaps his only real loss in a thrifty career scarce even amused he took them for granted without horror classifying them after their kind and calculating results andchances he might in old bewildering climates in old campaignsof cruelty and license have had such revelations and known suchamazements that he had nothing more to learn but he was whollycontent in spite of his fondness in domestic discussion forthe superlative degree and his kindness in the oddest way seemed to have nothing to do with his experience he could dealwith things perfectly for all his needs without getting nearthem this was the way he dealt with his wife a large proportion ofwhose meanings he knew he could neglect he edited for theirgeneral economy the play of her mind just as he edited savingly with the stump of a pencil her redundant telegrams the thing in the world that was least of a mystery to him was hisclub which he was accepted as perhaps too completely managing and which he managed on lines of perfect penetration hisconnection with it was really a master piece of editing this wasin fact to come back very much the process he might have beenproposing to apply to mrs assingham s view of what was nowbefore them that is to their connection with charlotte stant spossibilities they wouldn t lavish on them all their littlefortune of curiosity and alarm certainly they wouldn t spendtheir cherished savings so early in the day he liked charlotte moreover who was a smooth and compact inmate and whom he feltas with her instincts that made against waste much more of hisown sort than his wife he could talk with her about fanny almostbetter than he could talk with fanny about charlotte however hemade at present the best of the latter necessity even to thepressing of the question he has been noted as having lastuttered if you can t think what to be afraid of wait till youcan think then you ll do it much better or otherwise if that swaiting too long find out from her don t try to find out fromme ask her herself mrs assingham denied as we know that her husband had a play ofmind so that she could on her side treat these remarks only asif they had been senseless physical gestures or nervous facialmovements she overlooked them as from habit and kindness yetthere was no one to whom she talked so persistently of suchintimate things it s her friendship with maggie that s theimmense complication because that she audibly mused is sonatural then why can t she have come out for it she came out mrs assingham continued to meditate becauseshe hates america there was no place for her there she didn tfit in she wasn t in sympathy no more were the people she saw then it s hideously dear she can t on her means begin to livethere not at all as she can in a way here in the way you mean of living with us of living with anyone she can t live by visits alone and shedoesn t want to she s too good for it even if she could butshe will she must sooner or later stay with them maggie willwant her maggie will make her besides she ll want to herself then why won t that do the colonel asked for you to thinkit s what she has come for how will it do how she went on as without hearing him that s what one keeps feeling why shouldn t it do beautifully that anything of the past she brooded should come back now how will it do how will it do it will do i daresay without your wringing your hands over it when my dear the colonel pursued as he smoked have you everseen anything of yours anything that you ve done not do ah i didn t do this it brought her answer straight i didn tbring her back did you expect her to stay over there all her days to obligeyou not a bit for i shouldn t have minded her coming after theirmarriage it s her coming this way before to which she addedwith inconsequence i m too sorry for her of course she can tenjoy it but i don t see what perversity rides her she needn thave looked it all so in the face as she doesn t do it isuppose simply for discipline it s almost that s the bore ofit discipline to me perhaps then said bob assingham that s what has been heridea take it for god s sake as discipline to you and have donewith it it will do he added for discipline to me as well she was far however from having done with it it was asituation with such different sides as she said and to none ofwhich one could in justice be blind it isn t in the least you know for instance that i believe she s bad never never mrs assingham declared i don t think that of her then why isn t that enough nothing was enough mrs assingham signified but that she shoulddevelop her thought she doesn t deliberately intend shedoesn t consciously wish the least complication it s perfectlytrue that she thinks maggie a dear as who doesn t she sincapable of any plan to hurt a hair of her head yet here sheis and there they are she wound up her husband again for a little smoked in silence what in theworld between them ever took place between charlotte and the prince why nothing except theirhaving to recognise that nothing could that was their littleromance it was even their little tragedy but what the deuce did they do do they fell in love with each other but seeing it wasn tpossible gave each other up then where was the romance why in their frustration in their having the courage to lookthe facts in the face what facts the colonel went on well to begin with that of their neither of them having themeans to marry if she had had even a little a little i mean for two i believe he would bravely have done it after which as her husband but emitted an odd vague sound she correctedherself i mean if he himself had had only a little or a littlemore than a little a little for a prince they would have donewhat they could she did them justice if there had been a way but there wasn t a way and charlotte quite to her honour iconsider understood it he had to have money it was a questionof life and death it wouldn t have been a bit amusing either to marry him as a pauper i mean leaving him one that was whatshe had as he had the reason to see and their reason is what you call their romance she looked at him a moment what do you want more didn t he the colonel inquired want anything more ordidn t for that matter poor charlotte herself she kept her eyes on him there was a manner in it that halfanswered they were thoroughly in love she might have beenhis she checked herself she even for a minute lost herself she might have been anything she liked except his wife but she wasn t said the colonel very smokingly she wasn t mrs assingham echoed the echo not loud but deep filled for a little the room heseemed to listen to it die away then he began again how areyou sure she waited before saying but when she spoke it was definite there wasn t time he had a small laugh for her reason he might have expected someother does it take so much time she herself however remained serious it takes more than theyhad he was detached but he wondered what was the matter with theirtime after which as remembering it all living it over andpiecing it together she only considered you mean that you camein with your idea he demanded it brought her quickly to the point and as if also in a measureto answer herself not a bit of it then but you surelyrecall she went on the way a year ago everything tookplace they had parted before he had ever heard of maggie why hadn t he heard of her from charlotte herself because she had never spoken of her is that also the colonel inquired what she has told you i m not speaking his wife returned of what she has told me that s one thing i m speaking of what i know by myself that sanother you feel in other words that she lies to you bob assinghammore sociably asked she neglected the question treating it as gross she never somuch at the time as named maggie it was so positive that it appeared to strike him it s he thenwho has told you she after a moment admitted it it s he and he doesn t lie no to do him justice i believe he absolutely doesn t if ihadn t believed it mrs assingham declared for her generaljustification i would have had nothing to do with him that isin this connection he s a gentleman i mean all as much of oneas he ought to be and he had nothing to gain that helps sheadded even a gentleman it was i who named maggie to him ayear from last may he had never heard of her before then it s grave said the colonel she hesitated do you mean grave for me oh that everything s grave for you is what we take forgranted and are fundamentally talking about it s grave it was for charlotte and it s grave for maggie that is it was when hedid see her or when she did see him you don t torment me as much as you would like she presentlywent on because you think of nothing that i haven t a thousandtimes thought of and because i think of everything that younever will it would all she recognised have been grave if ithadn t all been right you can t make out she contended thatwe got to rome before the end of february he more than agreed there s nothing in life my dear that ican make out well there was nothing in life apparently that she at realneed couldn t charlotte who had been there that year fromearly quite from november left suddenly you ll quite remember about the th of april she was to have stayed on she was tohave stayed naturally more or less for us and she was to havestayed all the more that the ververs due all winter butdelayed week after week in paris were at last really coming they were coming that is maggie was largely to see her andabove all to be with her there it was all altered bycharlotte s going to florence she went from one day to theother you forget everything she gave her reasons but i thoughtit odd at the time i had a sense that something must havehappened the difficulty was that though i knew a little ididn t know enough i didn t know her relation with him had been as you say a near thing that is i didn t know how near thepoor girl s departure was a flight she went to save herself he had listened more than he showed as came out in his tone to save herself well also really i think to save him too i saw itafterwards i see it all now he would have been sorry he didn twant to hurt her oh i daresay the colonel laughed they generally don t at all events his wife pursued she escaped they both did for they had had simply to face it their marriage couldn t be and if that was so the sooner they put the apennines betweenthem the better it had taken them it is true some time to feelthis and to find it out they had met constantly and not alwayspublicly all that winter they had met more than was known though it was a good deal known more certainly she said than i then imagined though i don t know what difference itwould after all have made with me i liked him i thought himcharming from the first of our knowing him and now after morethan a year he has done nothing to spoil it and there arethings he might have done things that many men easily would therefore i believe in him and i was right at first in knowingi was going to so i haven t and she stated it as she mighthave quoted from a slate after adding up the items the sum of acolumn of figures so i haven t i say to myself been a fool well are you trying to make out that i ve said you have alltheir case wants at any rate bob assingham declared is thatyou should leave it well alone it s theirs now they ve boughtit over the counter and paid for it it has ceased to beyours of which case she asked are you speaking he smoked a minute then with a groan lord are there so many there s maggie s and the prince s and there s the prince s andcharlotte s oh yes and then the colonel scoffed there s charlotte s andthe prince s there s maggie s and charlotte s she went on and there salso maggie s and mine i think too that there s charlotte s andmine yes she mused charlotte s and mine is certainly a case in short you see there are plenty but i mean she said tokeep my head are we to settle them all he inquired to night i should lose it if things had happened otherwise if i hadacted with any folly she had gone on in her earnestness unheeding of his question i shouldn t be able to bear that now but my good conscience is my strength no one can accuse me the ververs came on to rome alone charlotte after their dayswith her in florence had decided about america maggie idaresay had helped her she must have made her a present and ahandsome one so that many things were easy charlotte left them came to england joined somebody or other sailed for new york i have still her letter from milan telling me i didn t know atthe moment all that was behind it but i felt in it neverthelessthe undertaking of a new life certainly in any case it clearedthat air i mean the dear old roman in which we were steeped it left the field free it gave me a free hand there was noquestion for me of anybody else when i brought the two otherstogether more than that there was no question for them so yousee she concluded where that puts me she got up on thewords very much as if they were the blue daylight towards which through a darksome tunnel she had been pushing her way and theelation in her voice combined with her recovered alertness might have signified the sharp whistle of the train that shootsat last into the open she turned about the room she looked outa moment into the august night she stopped here and there before the flowers in bowls and vases yes it was distinctly asif she had proved what was needing proof as if the issue of heroperation had been almost unexpectedly a success oldarithmetic had perhaps been fallacious but the new settled thequestion her husband oddly however kept his place withoutapparently measuring these results as he had been amused at herintensity so he was not uplifted by her relief his interestmight in fact have been more enlisted than he allowed do youmean he presently asked that he had already forgot aboutcharlotte she faced round as if he had touched a spring he wanted to naturally and it was much the best thing he could do she wasin possession of the main case as it truly seemed she had itall now he was capable of the effort and he took the best way remember too what maggie then seemed to us she s very nice but she always seems to me more than anythingelse the young woman who has a million a year if you mean thatthat s what she especially seemed to him you of course place thething in your light the effort to forget charlotte couldn t igrant you have been so difficult this pulled her up but for an instant i never said he didn tfrom the first i never said that he doesn t more and more likemaggie s money i never said i shouldn t have liked it myself bob assinghamreturned he made no movement he smoked another minute howmuch did maggie know how much she seemed to consider as if it were between quartsand gallons how best to express the quantity she knew whatcharlotte in florence had told her and what had charlotte told her very little what makes you so sure why this that she couldn t tell her and she explained alittle what she meant there are things my dear haven t youfelt it yourself coarse as you are that no one could tellmaggie there are things that upon my word i shouldn t care toattempt to tell her now the colonel smoked on it she d be so scandalised she d be so frightened she d be in her strange little way sohurt she wasn t born to know evil she must never know it bob assingham had a queer grim laugh the sound of which infact fixed his wife before him we re taking grand ways toprevent it but she stood there to protest we re not taking any ways theways are all taken they were taken from the moment he came up toour carriage that day in villa borghese the second or third ofher days in rome when as you remember you went off somewherewith mr verver and the prince who had got into the carriagewith us came home with us to tea they had met they had seeneach other well they were in relation the rest was to come ofitself and as it could it began practically i recollect inour drive maggie happened to learn by some other man s greetingof him in the bright roman way from a streetcorner as wepassed that one of the prince s baptismal names the one alwaysused for him among his relations was amerigo which as youprobably don t know however even after a lifetime of me wasthe name four hundred years ago or whenever of the pushing manwho followed across the sea in the wake of columbus andsucceeded where columbus had failed in becoming godfather orname father to the new continent so that the thought of anyconnection with him can even now thrill our artless breasts the colonel s grim placidity could always quite adequately meethis wife s not infrequent imputation of ignorances on the scoreof the land of her birth unperturbed and unashamed and thesedark depths were even at the present moment not directly lightedby an inquiry that managed to be curious without beingapologetic but where does the connection come in his wife was prompt by the women that is by some obligingwoman of old who was a descendant of the pushing man themake believe discoverer and whom the prince is therefore luckilyable to refer to as an ancestress a branch of the other familyhad become great great enough at least to marry into his andthe name of the navigator crowned with glory was verynaturally to become so the fashion among them that some son ofevery generation was appointed to wear it my point is at anyrate that i recall noticing at the time how the prince was fromthe start helped with the dear ververs by his wearing it theconnection became romantic for maggie the moment she took it in she filled out in a flash every link that might be vague bythat sign i quite said to myself he ll conquer with hisgood fortune of course of having the other necessary signs too it really said mrs assingham was practically the fine sideof the wedge which struck me as also she wound up a lovelynote for the candour of the ververs the colonel took in the tale but his comment was prosaic heknew amerigo what he was about and i don t mean the old one i know what you mean his wife bravely threw off the old one he pointed his effect isn t the only discovererin the family oh as much as you like if he discovered america or gothimself honoured as if he had his successors were in due time to discover the americans and it was one of them in particular doubtless who was to discover how patriotic we are wouldn t this be the same one the colonel asked who reallydiscovered what you call the connection she gave him a look the connection s a true thing theconnection s perfectly historic your insinuations recoil uponyour cynical mind don t you understand she asked that thehistory of such people is known root and branch at every momentof its course oh it s all right said bob assingham go to the british museum his companion continued with spirit and what am i to do there there s a whole immense room or recess or department orwhatever filled with books written about his family alone youcan see for yourself have you seen for your self she faltered but an instant certainly i went one day withmaggie we looked him up so to say they were most civil andshe fell again into the current her husband had slightly ruffled the effect was produced the charm began to work at all events in rome from that hour of the prince s drive with us my onlycourse afterwards had to be to make the best of it it wascertainly good enough for that mrs assingham hastened to add and i didn t in the least see my duty in making the worst inthe same situation to day i wouldn t act differently i enteredinto the case as it then appeared to me and as for the matterof that it still does i liked it i thought all sorts of goodof it and nothing can even now she said with some intensity make me think anything else nothing can ever make you think anything you don t want to thecolonel still in his chair remarked over his pipe you ve gota precious power of thinking whatever you do want you want also from moment to moment to think such desperately differentthings what happened he went on was that you fell violentlyin love with the prince yourself and that as you couldn t get meout of the way you had to take some roundabout course youcouldn t marry him any more than charlotte could that is not toyourself but you could to somebody else it was always theprince it was always marriage you could to your little friend to whom there were no objections not only there were no objections but there were reasons positive ones and all excellent all charming she spoke withan absence of all repudiation of his exposure of the spring ofher conduct and this abstention clearly and effectivelyconscious evidently cost her nothing it is always the prince and it is always thank heaven marriage and these are thethings god grant that it will always be that i could help ayear ago most assuredly made me happy and it continues to makeme happy then why aren t you quiet i am quiet said fanny assingham he looked at her with his colourless candour still in hisplace she moved about again a little emphasising by her unresther declaration of her tranquillity he was as silent at first as if he had taken her answer but he was not to keep it long what do you make of it that by your own show charlottecouldn t tell her all what do you make of it that the princedidn t tell her anything say one understands that there arethings she can t be told since as you put it she is so easilyscared and shocked he produced these objections slowly givingher time by his pauses to stop roaming and come back to him but she was roaming still when he concluded his inquiry ifthere hadn t been anything there shouldn t have been between thepair before charlotte bolted in order precisely as you say that there shouldn t be why in the world was what there hadbeen too bad to be spoken of mrs assingham after this question continued still tocirculate not directly meeting it even when at last she stopped i thought you wanted me to be quiet so i do and i m trying to make you so much so that you won tworry more can t you be quiet on that she thought a moment then seemed to try to relate that she hadto bolt for the reasons we speak of even though the boltinghad done for her what she wished that i can perfectly feelcharlotte s not wanting to do ah then if it has done for her what she wished but thecolonel s conclusion hung by the if which his wife didn t takeup so it hung but the longer when he presently spoke again allone wonders in that case is why then she has come back to him say she hasn t come back to him not really to him i ll say anything you like but that won t do me the same goodas your saying it nothing my dear will do you good mrs assingham returned you don t care for anything in itself you care for nothing butto be grossly amused because i don t keep washing my hands i thought your whole argument was that everything is so rightthat this is precisely what you do but his wife as it was a point she had often made could go onas she had gone on before you re perfectly indifferent really you re perfectly immoral you ve taken part in the sack ofcities and i m sure you ve done dreadful things yourself but idon t trouble my head if you like so now there she laughed he accepted her laugh but he kept his way well i back poorcharlotte back her to know what she wants ah then so do i she does know what she wants and mrs assingham produced this quantity at last on the girl s behalf as the ripe result of her late wanderings and musings she hadgroped through their talk for the thread and now she had gotit she wants to be magnificent she is said the colonel almost cynically she wants his wife now had it fast to be thoroughly superior and she s capable of that of wanting to of carrying out her idea and what is her idea to see maggie through bob assingham wondered through what through everything she knows the prince and maggie doesn t no dear thing mrs assingham had torecognise it she doesn t so that charlotte has come out to give her lessons she continued fanny assingham to work out her thought she hasdone this great thing for him that is a year ago shepractically did it she practically at any rate helped him todo it himself and helped me to help him she kept off shestayed away she left him free and what moreover were hersilences to maggie but a direct aid to him if she had spoken inflorence if she had told her own poor story if she had comeback at any time till within a few weeks ago if she hadn t goneto new york and hadn t held out there if she hadn t done thesethings all that has happened since would certainly have beendifferent therefore she s in a position to be consistent now she knows the prince mrs assingham repeated it involved evenagain her former recognition and maggie dear thing doesn t she was high she was lucid she was almost inspired and it wasbut the deeper drop therefore to her husband s flat common sense in other words maggie is by her ignorance in danger then ifshe s in danger there is danger there won t be with charlotte s understanding of it that swhere she has had her conception of being able to be heroic ofbeing able in fact to be sublime she is she will be the goodlady by this time glowed so she sees it to become for herbest friend an element of positive safety bob assingham looked at it hard which of them do you call herbest friend she gave a toss of impatience i ll leave you to discover butthe grand truth thus made out she had now completely adopted it s for us therefore to be hers hers you and i it s for us to be charlotte s it s for us on ourside to see her through through her sublimity through her noble lonely life only that s essential itmustn t be lonely it will be all right if she marries so we re to marry her we re to marry her it will be mrs assingham continued thegreat thing i can do she made it out more and more it willmake up make up for what as she said nothing however his desire forlucidity renewed itself if everything s so all right what isthere to make up for why if i did do either of them by any chance a wrong if imade a mistake you ll make up for it by making another and then as she againtook her time i thought your whole point is just that you resure one can never be ideally sure of anything there are alwayspossibilities then if we can but strike so wild why keep meddling it made her again look at him where would you have been mydear if i hadn t meddled with you ah that wasn t meddling i was your own i was your own saidthe colonel from the moment i didn t object well these people won t object they are my own too in thesense that i m awfully fond of them also in the sense shecontinued that i think they re not so very much less fond ofme our relation all round exists it s a reality and a verygood one we re mixed up so to speak and it s too late tochange it we must live in it and with it therefore to see thatcharlotte gets a good husband as soon as possible that as isay will be one of my ways of living it will cover she saidwith conviction all the ground and then as his own convictionappeared to continue as little to match the ground i mean ofany nervousness i may ever feel it will be in fact my dutyand i shan t rest till my duty s performed she had arrived bythis time at something like exaltation i shall give for thenext year or two if necessary my life to it i shall have donein that case what i can he took it at last as it came you hold there s no limit to whatyou can i don t say there s no limit or anything of the sort i saythere are good chances enough of them for hope why shouldn tthere be when a girl is after all all that she is by after all you mean after she s in love with somebody else the colonel put his question with a quietude doubtless designedto be fatal but it scarcely pulled her up she s not too muchin love not herself to want to marry she would now particularlylike to has she told you so not yet it s too soon but she will meanwhile however idon t require the information her marrying will prove thetruth and what truth the truth of everything i say prove it to whom well to myself to begin with that will be enough for me towork for her what it will prove mrs assingham presently wenton will be that she s cured that she accepts the situation he paid this the tribute of a long pull at his pipe thesituation of doing the one thing she can that will really seem tocover her tracks his wife looked at him the good dry man as if now at last hewas merely vulgar the one thing she can do that will reallymake new tracks altogether the thing that before any other will be wise and right the thing that will best give her herchance to be magnificent he slowly emitted his smoke and best give you by the sametoken yours to be magnificent with her i shall be as magnificent at least as i can bob assingham got up and you call me immoral she hesitated i ll call you stupid if you prefer but stupiditypushed to a certain point is you know immorality just so whatis morality but high intelligence this he was unable to tellher which left her more definitely to conclude besides it sall at the worst great fun oh if you simply put it at that his implication was that in this case they had a common ground yet even thus he couldn t catch her by it oh i don t mean she said from the threshold the fun that you mean good night in answer to which as he turned out the electric light he gavean odd short groan almost a grunt he had apparently meant someparticular kind v well now i must tell you for i want to be absolutely honest so charlotte spoke a little ominously after they had got intothe park i don t want to pretend and i can t pretend a momentlonger you may think of me what you will but i don t care iknew i shouldn t and i find now how little i came back for this not really for anything else for this she repeated as underthe influence of her tone the prince had already come to apause for this he spoke as if the particular thing she indicatedwere vague to him or were rather a quantity that couldn t atthe most be much it would be as much however as she should be able to make it to have one hour alone with you it had rained heavily in thenight and though the pavements were now dry thanks to acleansing breeze the august morning with its hovering thick drifting clouds and freshened air was cool and grey themultitudinous green of the park had been deepened and awholesome smell of irrigation purging the place of dust and ofodours less acceptable rose from the earth charlotte had lookedabout her with expression from the first of their coming in quite as if for a deep greeting for general recognition the daywas even in the heart of london of a rich low browed weatherwashed english type it was as if it had been waiting forher as if she knew it placed it loved it as if it were infact a part of what she had come back for so far as this was thecase the impression of course could only be lost on a mere vagueitalian it was one of those for which you had to be blessedly an american as indeed you had to be blessedly an american forall sorts of things so long as you hadn t blessedly or not toremain in america the prince had by half past ten as also bydefinite appointment called in cadogan place for mrs assingham s visitor and then after brief delay the two hadwalked together up sloane street and got straight into the parkfrom knightsbridge the understanding to this end had taken itsplace after a couple of days as inevitably consequent on theappeal made by the girl during those first moments in mrs assingham s drawing room it was an appeal the couple of days haddone nothing to invalidate everything much rather to place ina light and as to which obviously it wouldn t have fitted thatanyone should raise an objection who was there for that matter to raise one from the moment mrs assingham informed andapparently not disapproving didn t intervene this the young manhad asked himself with a very sufficient sense of what wouldhave made him ridiculous he wasn t going to begin that at leastwas certain by showing a fear even had fear at first been sharpin him moreover it would already not a little have dropped so happy all round so propitious he quite might have calledit had been the effect of this rapid interval the time had been taken up largely by his active reception of hisown wedding guests and by maggie s scarce less absorbedentertainment of her friend whom she had kept for hours togetherin portland place whom she had not as wouldn t have beenconvenient invited altogether as yet to migrate but who hadbeen present with other persons his contingent at luncheon attea at dinner at perpetual repasts he had never in his life it struck him had to reckon with so much eating whenever he hadlooked in if he had not again till this hour save for aminute seen charlotte alone so positively all the while hehad not seen even maggie and if therefore he had not seen evenmaggie nothing was more natural than that he shouldn t have seencharlotte the exceptional minute a mere snatch at the tail ofthe others on the huge portland place staircase had sufficientlyenabled the girl to remind him so ready she assumed him to be of what they were to do time pressed if they were to do it atall everyone had brought gifts his relations had broughtwonders how did they still have where did they still find suchtreasures she only had brought nothing and she was ashamed yeteven by the sight of the rest of the tribute she wouldn t be putoff she would do what she could and he was unknown to maggie he must remember to give her his aid he had prolonged theminute so far as to take time to hesitate for a reason and thento risk bringing his reason out the risk was because he mighthurt her hurt her pride if she had that particular sort butshe might as well be hurt one way as another and besides thatparticular sort of pride was just what she hadn t so his slightresistance while they lingered had been just easy enough not tobe impossible i hate to encourage you and for such a purpose after all tospend your money she had stood a stair or two below him where while she lookedup at him beneath the high domed light of the hall she rubbedwith her palm the polished mahogany of the balustrade which wasmounted on fine ironwork eighteenth century english becauseyou think i must have so little i ve enough at any rate enoughfor us to take our hour enough she had smiled is as good asa feast and then she had said it isn t of course a questionof anything expensive gorged with treasure as maggie is itisn t a question of competing or outshining what naturally inthe way of the priceless hasn t she got mine is to be theoffering of the poor something precisely that no rich personcould ever give her and that being herself too rich ever to buyit she would therefore never have charlotte had spoken as ifafter so much thought only as it can t be fine it ought to befunny and that s the sort of thing to hunt for hunting inlondon besides is amusing in itself he recalled even how he had been struck with her word funny oh i don t mean a comic toy i mean some little thing with acharm but absolutely right in its comparative cheapness that swhat i call funny she had explained you used she had alsoadded to help me to get things cheap in rome you were splendidfor beating down i have them all still i needn t say thelittle bargains i there owed you there are bargains in london inaugust ah but i don t understand your english buying and i confess ifind it dull so much as that while they turned to go uptogether he had objected i understood my poor dear romans it was they who understood you that was your pull she hadlaughed our amusement here is just that they don t understandus we can make it amusing you ll see if he had hesitated again it was because the point permitted the amusement surely will be to find our present certainly as i say well if they don t come down then we ll come up there s always something to be done besides prince she had gone on i m not if you come to that absolutely a pauper i m too poor for some things she hadsaid yet strange as she was lightly enough but i m not toopoor for others and she had paused again at the top i ve beensaving up he had really challenged it in america yes even there with my motive and we oughtn t you know shehad wound up to leave it beyond to morrow that definitely with ten words more was what had passed hefeeling all the while how any sort of begging off would onlymagnify it he might get on with things as they were but he mustdo anything rather than magnify besides which it was pitiful tomake her beg of him he was making her she had begged and this for a special sensibility in him didn t at all do that wasaccordingly in fine how they had come to where they were hewas engaged as hard as possible in the policy of notmagnifying he had kept this up even on her making a point andas if it were almost the whole point that maggie of course wasnot to have an idea half the interest of the thing at leastwould be that she shouldn t suspect therefore he was completelyto keep it from her as charlotte on her side would that theyhad been anywhere at all together or had so much as seen eachother for five minutes alone the absolute secrecy of theirlittle excursion was in short of the essence she appealed to hiskindness to let her feel that he didn t betray her there hadbeen something frankly a little disconcerting in such an appealat such an hour on the very eve of his nuptials it was onething to have met the girl casually at mrs assingham s andanother to arrange with her thus for a morning practically asprivate as their old mornings in rome and practically not lessintimate he had immediately told maggie the same evening ofthe minutes that had passed between them in cadogan place thoughnot mentioning those of mrs assingham s absence any more than hementioned the fact of what their friend had then with such smalldelay proposed but what had briefly checked his assent to anypresent to any positive making of mystery what had made him while they stood at the top of the stairs demur just long enoughfor her to notice it was the sense of the resemblance of thelittle plan before him to occasions of the past from which hewas quite disconnected from which he could only desire to be this was like beginning something over which was the last thinghe wanted the strength the beauty of his actual position was inits being wholly a fresh start was that what it began would benew altogether these items of his consciousness had clustered soquickly that by the time charlotte read them in his face he wasin presence of what they amounted to she had challenged them assoon as read them had met them with a do you want then to goand tell her that had somehow made them ridiculous it had madehim promptly fall back on minimizing it that is on minimizing fuss apparent scruples were obviously fuss and he had onthe spot clutched in the light of this truth at the happyprinciple that would meet every case this principle was simply to be with the girl always simple and with the very last simplicity that would cover everything it had covered then and there certainly his immediatesubmission to the sight of what was clearest this was really that what she asked was little compared to what she gave whatshe gave touched him as she faced him for it was the full tuneof her renouncing she really renounced renounced everything and without even insisting now on what it had all been for her her only insistence was her insistence on the small matter oftheir keeping their appointment to themselves that in exchangefor everything everything she gave up was verily but atrifle he let himself accordingly be guided he so soonassented for enlightened indulgence to any particular turn shemight wish the occasion to take that the stamp of her preferencehad been well applied to it even while they were still in thepark the application in fact presently required that they shouldsit down a little really to see where they were in obedience towhich propriety they had some ten minutes of a quality quitedistinct in a couple of penny chairs under one of the largertrees they had taken for their walk to the cropped rain freshened grass after finding it already dry and thechairs turned away from the broad alley the main drive and theaspect of park lane looked across the wide reaches of greenwhich seemed in a manner to refine upon their freedom theyhelped charlotte thus to make her position her temporaryposition still more clear and it was for this purpose obviously that abruptly on seeing her opportunity she satdown he stood for a little before her as if to mark theimportance of not wasting time the importance she herself hadpreviously insisted on but after she had said a few words it wasimpossible for him not to resort again to good nature he markedas he could by this concession that if he had finally met herfirst proposal for what would be amusing in it so any idea shemight have would contribute to that effect he had consequently in all consistency to treat it as amusing that she reaffirmed and reaffirmed again the truth that was her truth i don t care what you make of it and i don t ask anythingwhatever of you anything but this i want to have said it that s all i want not to have failed to say it to see you onceand be with you to be as we are now and as we used to be forone small hour or say for two that s what i have had for weeksin my head i mean of course to get it before before whatyou re going to do so all the while you see she went on withher eyes on him it was a question for me if i should be able tomanage it in time if i couldn t have come now i probablyshouldn t have come at all perhaps even ever now that i m herei shall stay but there were moments over there when idespaired it wasn t easy there were reasons but it was eitherthis or nothing so i didn t struggle you see in vain after oh i didn t want that i don t mean she smiled that itwouldn t have been delightful to see you even then to see you atany time but i would never have come for it this is different this is what i wanted this is what i ve got this is what ishall always have this is what i should have missed of course she pursued if you had chosen to make me miss it if you hadthought me horrid had refused to come i should naturally havebeen immensely sold i had to take the risk well you re all icould have hoped that s what i was to have said i didn t wantsimply to get my time with you but i wanted you to know iwanted you she kept it up slowly softly with a small tremorof voice but without the least failure of sense or sequence iwanted you to understand i wanted you that is to hear i don tcare i think whether you understand or not if i ask nothing ofyou i don t i mayn t ask even so much as that what you maythink of me that doesn t in the least matter what i want isthat it shall always be with you so that you ll never be ablequite to get rid of it that i did i won t say that you did youmay make as little of that as you like but that i was here withyou where we are and as we are i just saying this givingmyself in other words away and perfectly willing to do it fornothing that s all she paused as if her demonstration was complete yet for themoment without moving as if in fact to give it a few minutes tosink in into the listening air into the watching space intothe conscious hospitality of nature so far as nature was alllondonised all vulgarised with them there or even for thatmatter into her own open ears rather than into the attention ofher passive and prudent friend his attention had done all thatattention could do his handsome slightly anxious yet stillmore definitely amused face sufficiently played its part heclutched however at what he could best clutch at the fact thatshe let him off definitely let him off she let him off itseemed even from so much as answering so that while he smiledback at her in return for her information he felt his lips remainclosed to the successive vaguenesses of rejoinder of objection that rose for him from within charlotte herself spoke again atlast you may want to know what i get by it but that s my ownaffair he really didn t want to know even this or continued for the safest plan quite to behave as if he didn t whichprolonged the mere dumbness of diversion in which he had takenrefuge he was glad when finally the point she had wished tomake seeming established to her satisfaction they brought towhat might pass for a close the moment of his life at which hehad had least to say movement and progress after this withmore impersonal talk were naturally a relief so that he was notagain during their excursion at a loss for the right word theair had been as it were cleared they had their errand itselfto discuss and the opportunities of london the sense of thewonderful place the pleasures of prowling there the question ofshops of possibilities of particular objects noticed by eachin previous prowls each professed surprise at the extent of theother s knowledge the prince in especial wondered at hisfriend s possession of her london he had rather prized his ownpossession the guidance he could really often give a cabman itwas a whim of his own a part of his anglomania and congruouswith that feature which had after all so much more surfacethan depth when his companion with the memory of other visitsand other rambles spoke of places he hadn t seen and things hedidn t know he actually felt again as half the effect just ashade humiliated he might even have felt a trifle annoyed if ithadn t been on this spot for his being even more interested it was a fresh light on charlotte and on her curiousworld quality of which in rome he had had his due sense butwhich clearly would show larger on the big london stage romewas in comparison a village a family party a little old worldspinnet for the fingers of one hand by the time they reached themarble arch it was almost as if she were showing him a new side and that in fact gave amusement a new and a firmer basis theright tone would be easy for putting himself in her hands shouldthey disagree a little frankly and fairly about directions andchances values and authenticities the situation would be quitegloriously saved they were none the less as happened much ofone mind on the article of their keeping clear of resorts withwhich maggie would be acquainted charlotte recalled it as amatter of course named it in time as a condition they wouldkeep away from any place to which he had already been withmaggie this made indeed a scant difference for though he had during thelast month done few things so much as attend his future wife onher making of purchases the antiquarii as he called them withcharlotte had not been the great affair except in bond street really maggie had had no use for them her situation indeed inconnection with that order of traffic was full of consequencesproduced by her father s mr verver one of the great collectorsof the world hadn t left his daughter to prowl for herself hehad little to do with shops and was mostly as a purchaser approached privately and from afar great people all overeurope sought introductions to him high personages incrediblyhigh and more of them than would ever be known solemnly swornas everyone was in such cases to discretion high personagesmade up to him as the one man on the short authentic list likelyto give the price it had therefore been easy to settle as theywalked that the tracks of the ververs daughter s as well asfather s were to be avoided the importance only was that theirtalk about it led for a moment to the first words they had as yetexchanged on the subject of maggie charlotte still in the park proceeded to them for it was she who began with a serenity ofappreciation that was odd certainly as a sequel to her words often minutes before this was another note on her what he wouldhave called another light for her companion who though withoutgiving a sign admired for what it was the simplicity of hertransition a transition that took no trouble either to trace orto explain itself she paused again an instant on the grass tomake it she stopped before him with a sudden anything ofcourse dear as she is will do for her i mean if i were to giveher a pin cushion from the baker street bazaar that s exactly what i meant the prince laughed out thisallusion to their snatch of talk in portland place it s justwhat i suggested she took however no notice of the reminder she went on in herown way but it isn t a reason in that case one would never doanything for her i mean charlotte explained if one tookadvantage of her character of her character we mustn t take advantage of her character the girl againunheeding pursued one mustn t if not for her at least forone s self she saves one such trouble she had spoken thoughtfully with her eyes on her friend s shemight have been talking preoccupied and practical of someonewith whom he was comparatively unconnected she certainly givesone no trouble said the prince and then as if this wereperhaps ambiguous or inadequate she s not selfish god forgiveher enough that s what i mean charlotte instantly said she s notselfish enough there s nothing absolutely that one need do forher she s so modest she developed she doesn t miss things imean if you love her or rather i should say if she loves you she lets it go the prince frowned a little as a tribute after all toseriousness she lets what anything anything that you might do and that you don t shelets everything go but her own disposition to be kind to you it s of herself that she asks efforts so far as she ever has toask them she hasn t much she does everything herself andthat s terrible the prince had listened but always with propriety he didn tcommit himself terrible well unless one is almost as good as she it makes too easyterms for one it takes stuff within one so far as one sdecency is concerned to stand it and nobody charlottecontinued in the same manner is decent enough good enough tostand it not without help from religion or something of thatkind not without prayer and fasting that is without takinggreat care certainly she said such people as you and i arenot the prince obligingly thought an instant not good enough tostand it well not good enough not rather to feel the strain we happeneach i think to be of the kind that are easily spoiled her friend again for propriety followed the argument oh idon t know may not one s affection for her do something more forone s decency as you call it than her own generosity her ownaffection her decency has the unfortunate virtue to undo ah of course it must be all in that but she had made her question all the same interesting to him what it comes to one can see what you mean is the way shebelieves in one that is if she believes at all yes that s what it comes to said charlotte stant and why he asked almost soothingly should it be terrible he couldn t at the worst see that because it s always so the idea of having to pity people not when there s also with it the idea of helping them yes but if we can t help them we can we always can that is he competently added if wecare for them and that s what we re talking about yes she on the whole assented it comes back then to ourabsolutely refusing to be spoiled certainly but everything the prince laughed as they went on all your decency i mean comes back to that she walked beside him a moment it s just what i meant shethen reasonably said vithe man in the little shop in which well after this theylingered longest the small but interesting dealer in thebloomsbury street who was remarkable for an insistence notimportunate inasmuch as it was mainly mute but singularly intensely coercive this personage fixed on his visitors anextraordinary pair of eyes and looked from one to the other whilethey considered the object with which he appeared mainly to hopeto tempt them they had come to him last for their time wasnearly up an hour of it at least from the moment of theirgetting into a hansom at the marble arch having yielded nobetter result than the amusement invoked from the first theamusement of course was to have consisted in seeking but ithad also involved the idea of finding which latter necessitywould have been obtrusive only if they had found too soon thequestion at present was if they were finding and they put it toeach other in the bloomsbury shop while they enjoyed theundiverted attention of the shopman he was clearly the master and devoted to his business the essence of which in hisconception might precisely have been this particular secret thathe possessed for worrying the customer so little that it fairlymade for their relations a sort of solemnity he had not manythings none of the redundancy of rot they had elsewhere seen and our friends had on entering even had the sense of a musterso scant that as high values obviously wouldn t reign theeffect might be almost pitiful then their impression hadchanged for though the show was of small pieces several takenfrom the little window and others extracted from a cupboardbehind the counter dusky in the rather low browed place despite its glass doors each bid for their attention spoke however modestly for itself and the pitch of theirentertainer s pretensions was promptly enough given his arraywas heterogeneous and not at all imposing still it differedagreeably from what they had hitherto seen charlotte after the incident was to be full of impressions ofseveral of which later on she gave her companion always in theinterest of their amusement the benefit and one of theimpressions had been that the man himself was the greatestcuriosity they had looked at the prince was to reply to thisthat he himself hadn t looked at him as precisely in thegeneral connection charlotte had more than once from otherdays noted for his advantage her consciousness of how below acertain social plane he never saw one kind of shopman was justlike another to him which was oddly inconsequent on the part ofa mind that where it did notice noticed so much he tookthroughout always the meaner sort for granted the night oftheir meanness or whatever name one might give it for him madeall his cats grey he didn t no doubt want to hurt them but heimaged them no more than if his eyes acted only for the level ofhis own high head her own vision acted for every relation thishe had seen for himself she remarked beggars she rememberedservants she recognised cabmen she had often distinguishedbeauty when out with him in dirty children she had admired type in faces at hucksters stalls therefore on thisoccasion she had found their antiquario interesting partlybecause he cared so for his things and partly because he cared well so for them he likes his things he loves them she wasto say and it isn t only it isn t perhaps even at all that heloves to sell them i think he would love to keep them if hecould and he prefers at any rate to sell them to right people we clearly were right people he knows them when he sees them and that s why as i say you could make out or at least i could that he cared for us didn t you see she was to ask itwith an insistence the way he looked at us and took us in idoubt if either of us have ever been so well looked at before yes he ll remember us she was to profess herself convinced ofthat almost to uneasiness but it was after all this wasperhaps reassuring because given his taste since he hastaste he was pleased with us he was struck he had ideas aboutus well i should think people might we re beautiful aren twe and he knows then also he has his way for that way ofsaying nothing with his lips when he s all the while pressing youso with his face which shows how he knows you feel it that is aregular way of decent old gold old silver old bronze of old chased andjewelled artistry were the objects that successively produced had ended by numerously dotting the counter where the shopman sslim light fingers with neat nails

snapping little box there was in spite of the dueproportion of faint poetry no great force of persuasion theylooked the visitors they touched they vaguely pretended toconsider but with scepticism so far as courtesy permitted inthe quality of their attention it was impossible they shouldn t after a little tacitly agree as to the absurdity of carrying tomaggie a token from such a stock it would be that was thedifficulty pretentious without being good too usual as atreasure to have been an inspiration of the giver and yet tooprimitive to be taken as tribute welcome on any terms they hadbeen out more than two hours and evidently had found nothing it forced from charlotte a kind of admission it ought really if it should be a thing of this sort to takeits little value from having belonged to one s self ecco said the prince just triumphantly enough there youare behind the dealer were sundry small cupboards in the wall two orthree of these charlotte had seen him open so that her eyesfound themselves resting on those he had not visited but shecompleted her admission there s nothing here she could wear it was only after a moment that her companion rejoined is thereanything do you think that you could it made her just start she didn t at all events look at theobjects she but looked for an instant very directly at him no ah the prince quietly exclaimed would it be charlotte asked your idea to offer mesomething well why not as a small ricordo but a ricordo of what why of this as you yourself say of this little hunt oh i say it but hasn t my whole point been that i don t askyou to therefore she demanded but smiling at him now where s the logic oh the logic he laughed but logic s everything that at least is how i feel it aricordo from you from you to me is a ricordo of nothing ithas no reference ah my dear he vaguely protested their entertainer meanwhile stood there with his eyes on them and the girl though at this minute more interested in her passage with herfriend than in anything else again met his gaze it was acomfort to her that their foreign tongue covered what they said and they might have appeared of course as the prince now had oneof the snuffboxes in his hand to be discussing a purchase you don t refer she went on to her companion i refer he had lifted the lid of his little box and he looked into ithard do you mean by that then that you would be free free to offer me something this gave her a longer pause and when she spoke again she mighthave seemed oddly to be addressing the dealer would you allowme no said the prince into his little box you wouldn t accept it from me no he repeated in the same way she exhaled a long breath that was like a guarded sigh butyou ve touched an idea that has been mine it s what i vewanted then she added it was what i hoped he put down his box this had drawn his eyes he made nothing clearly of the little man s attention it s what you brought meout for well that s at any rate she returned my own affair butit won t do it won t do cara mia it s impossible it s impossible and he took up one of the brooches she had another pause while the shopman only waited if i wereto accept from you one of these charming little ornaments as yousuggest what should i do with it he was perhaps at last a little irritated he even as if hemight understand looked vaguely across at their host wear it per bacco where then please under my clothes wherever you like but it isn t then if you will he added worth talking about it s only worth talking about mio caro she smiled from yourhaving begun it my question is only reasonable so that youridea may stand or fall by your answer to it if i should pin oneof these things on for you would it be to your mind that imight go home and show it to maggie as your present they had had between them often in talk the refrain jocosely descriptively applied of old roman it had been as apleasantry in the other time his explanation to her ofeverything but nothing truly had even seemed so old roman asthe shrug in which he now indulged why in the world not because on our basis it would be impossible to give her anaccount of the pretext the pretext he wondered the occasion this ramble that we shall have had together andthat we re not to speak of oh yes he said after a moment i remember we re not to speakof it that of course you re pledged to and the one thing you see goes with the other so you don t insist he had again at random laid back his trinket with which hequite turned to her a little wearily at last even a littleimpatiently i don t insist it disposed for the time of the question but what was nextapparent was that it had seen them no further the shopman whohad not stirred stood there in his patience which his muteintensity helping had almost the effect of an ironic comment the prince moved to the glass door and his back to the others as with nothing more to contribute looked though not lesspatiently into the street then the shopman for charlotte momentously broke silence you ve seen disgraziatamente signora principessa he sadly said too much and it made theprince face about for the effect of the momentous came if notfrom the sense from the sound of his words which was that ofthe suddenest sharpest italian charlotte exchanged with herfriend a glance that matched it and just for the minute theywere held in check but their glance had after all by thattime said more than one thing had both exclaimed on theapprehension by the wretch of their intimate conversation letalone of her possible her impossible title and remarked formutual reassurance that it didn t all the same matter theprince remained by the door but immediately addressing thespeaker from where he stood you re italian then are you but the reply came in english oh dear no you re english to which the answer was this time with a smile in briefestitalian che the dealer waived the question he practicallydisposed of it by turning straightway toward a receptacle towhich he had not yet resorted and from which after unlocking it he extracted a square box of some twenty inches in height covered with worn looking leather he placed the box on thecounter pushed back a pair of small hooks lifted the lid andremoved from its nest a drinking vessel larger than a common cup yet not of exorbitant size and formed to appearance either ofold fine gold or of some material once richly gilt he handled itwith tenderness with ceremony making a place for it on a smallsatin mat my golden bowl he observed and it sounded on hislips as if it said everything he left the important object foras important it did somehow present itself to produce itscertain effect simple but singularly elegant it stood on acircular foot a short pedestal with a slightly spreading base and though not of signal depth justified its title by the charmof its shape as well as by the tone of its surface it might havebeen a large goblet diminished to the enhancement of its happycurve by half its original height as formed of solid gold itwas impressive it seemed indeed to warn off the prudent admirer charlotte with care immediately took it up while the prince who had after a minute shifted his position again regarded itfrom a distance it was heavier than charlotte had thought gold really gold she asked of their companion he hesitated look a little and perhaps you ll make out she looked holding it up in both her fine hands turning it tothe light it may be cheap for what it is but it will be dear i m afraid for me well said the man i can part with it for less than itsvalue i got it you see for less for how much then again he waited always with his serene stare do you like itthen charlotte turned to her friend do you like it he came nonearer he looked at their companion cos e well signori miei if you must know it s just a perfectcrystal of course we must know per dio said the prince but he turnedaway again he went back to his glass door charlotte set down the bowl she was evidently taken do youmean it s cut out of a single crystal if it isn t i think i can promise you that you ll never find anyjoint or any piecing she wondered even if i were to scrape off the gold he showed though with due respect that she amused him youcouldn t scrape it off it has been too well put on put on idon t know when and i don t know how but by some very fine oldworker and by some beautiful old process charlotte frankly charmed with the cup smiled back at him now a lost art call it a lost art but of what time then is the whole thing well say also of a lost time the girl considered then if it s so precious how comes it tobe cheap her interlocutor once more hung fire but by this time the princehad lost patience i ll wait for you out in the air he said tohis companion and though he spoke without irritation hepointed his remark by passing immediately into the street where during the next minutes the others saw him his back to theshopwindow philosophically enough hover and light a freshcigarette charlotte even took a little her time she was awareof his funny italian taste for london street life her host meanwhile at any rate answered her question ah i vehad it a long time without selling it i think i must have beenkeeping it madam for you you ve kept it for me because you ve thought i mightn t seewhat s the matter with it he only continued to face her he only continued to appear tofollow the play of her mind what is the matter with it oh it s not for me to say it s for you honestly to tell me ofcourse i know something must be but if it s something you can t find out isn t it as good as ifit were nothing i probably should find out as soon as i had paid for it not her host lucidly insisted if you hadn t paid too much what do you call she asked little enough well what should you say to fifteen pounds i should say said charlotte with the utmost promptitude thatit s altogether too much the dealer shook his head slowly and sadly but firmly it s myprice madam and if you admire the thing i think it really mightbe yours it s not too much it s too little it s almostnothing i can t go lower charlotte wondering but resisting bent over the bowl again then it s impossible it s more than i can afford ah the man returned one can sometimes afford for a presentmore than one can afford for one s self he said it so coaxinglythat she found herself going on without as might be said putting him in his place oh of course it would be only for apresent then it would be a lovely one does one make a present she asked of an object thatcontains to one s knowledge a flaw well if one knows of it one has only to mention it the goodfaith the man smiled is always there and leave the person to whom one gives the thing you mean todiscover it he wouldn t discover it if you re speaking of a gentleman i m not speaking of anyone in particular charlotte said well whoever it might be he might know and he might try buthe wouldn t find she kept her eyes on him as if though unsatisfied mystified she yet had a fancy for the bowl not even if the thing shouldcome to pieces and then as he was silent not even if heshould have to say to me the golden bowl is broken he was still silent after which he had his strangest smile ah if anyone should want to smash it she laughed she almost admired the little man s expression youmean one could smash it with a hammer yes if nothing else would do or perhaps even by dashing itwith violence say upon a marble floor oh marble floors but she might have been thinking for theywere a connection marble floors a connection with many things with her old rome and with his with the palaces of his past and a little of hers with the possibilities of his future with the sumptuosities of his marriage with the wealth of theververs all the same however there were other things and theyall together held for a moment her fancy does crystal thenbreak when it is crystal i thought its beauty was itshardness her friend in his way discriminated its beauty is its beingcrystal but its hardness is certainly its safety it doesn tbreak he went on like vile glass it splits if there is asplit ah charlotte breathed with interest if there is a split and she looked down again at the bowl there is a split eh crystal does split eh on lines and by laws of its own you mean if there s a weak place for all answer after an hesitation he took the bowl up again holding it aloft and tapping it with a key it rang with thefinest sweetest sound where is the weak place she then did the question justice well for me only the price i m poor you see very poor but i thank you and i ll think the prince on the other side of the shop window had finallyfaced about and as to see if she hadn t done was trying toreach with his eyes the comparatively dim interior i likeit she said i want it but i must decide what i can do the man not ungraciously resigned himself well i ll keep itfor you the small quarter of an hour had had its marked oddity this shefelt even by the time the open air and the bloomsbury aspects hadagain in their protest against the truth of her gatheredimpression made her more or less their own yet the oddity mighthave been registered as small as compared to the other effectthat before they had gone much further she had with hercompanion to take account of this latter was simply the effectof their having by some tacit logic some queer inevitability quite dropped the idea of a continued pursuit they didn t sayso but it was on the line of giving up maggie s present thatthey practically proceeded the line of giving it up without morereference to it the prince s first reference was in fact quiteindependently made i hope you satisfied yourself before youhad done of what was the matter with that bowl no indeed i satisfied myself of nothing of nothing at leastbut that the more i looked at it the more i liked it and that ifyou weren t so unaccommodating this would be just the occasionfor your giving me the pleasure of accepting it he looked graver for her at this than he had looked all themorning do you propose it seriously without wishing to play mea trick she wondered what trick would it be he looked at her harder you mean you really don t know but know what why what s the matter with it you didn t see all the while she only continued however to stare how could you see out inthe street i saw before i went out it was because i saw that i did go out i didn t want to have another scene with you before that rascal and i judged you would presently guess for yourself is he a rascal charlotte asked his price is so moderate shewaited but a moment five pounds really so little five pounds he continued to look at her five pounds he might have been doubting her word but he was only itappeared gathering emphasis it would be dear to make a giftof at five shillings if it had cost you even but five pence iwouldn t take it from you then she asked what is the matter why it has a crack it sounded on his lips so sharp it had such an authority thatshe almost started while her colour at the word rose it wasas if he had been right though his assurance was wonderful youanswer for it without having looked i did look i saw the object itself it told its story nowonder it s cheap but it s exquisite charlotte as if with an interest in it nowmade even tenderer and stranger found herself moved to insist of course it s exquisite that s the danger then a lightvisibly came to her a light in which her friend suddenly andintensely showed the reflection of it as she smiled at him wasin her own face the danger i see is because you resuperstitious per dio i m superstitious a crack is a crack and an omen s anomen you d be afraid per bacco for your happiness for my happiness for your safety for my safety she just paused for your marriage for my marriage for everything she thought again thank goodness then that if there be a crackwe know it but if we may perish by cracks in things that wedon t know and she smiled with the sadness of it we cannever then give each other anything he considered but he met it ah but one does know i do atleast and by instinct i don t fail that will always protectme it was funny the way he said such things yet she liked him really the more for it they fell in for her with a general orrather with a special vision but she spoke with a mild despair what then will protect me where i m concerned i will from me at least you ve nothing tofear he now quite amiably responded anything you consent toaccept from me but he paused well well shall be perfect that s very fine she presently answered it s vain afterall for you to talk of my accepting things when you ll acceptnothing from me ah there better still he could meet her you attach animpossible condition that i mean of my keeping your gift so tomyself well she looked before him there at the condition then abruptly with a gesture she gave it up she had a headshake ofdisenchantment so far as the idea had appealed to her it allappeared too difficult oh my condition i don t hold to it you may cry it on the housetops anything i ever do ah well then this made he laughed all the difference but it was too late oh i don t care now i should have likedthe bowl but if that won t do there s nothing he considered this he took it in looking graver again butafter a moment he qualified yet i shall want some day to giveyou something she wondered at him what day the day you marry for you will marry you must seriously marry she took it from him but it determined in her the only words shewas to have uttered all the morning that came out as if aspring had been pressed to make you feel better well he replied frankly wonderfully it will but here headded is your hansom he had signalled the cab was charging she put out no hand fortheir separation but she prepared to get in before she did so however she said what had been gathering while she waited well i would marry i think to have something from you in allfreedom part secondviiadam verver at fawns that autumn sunday might have beenobserved to open the door of the billiard room with a certainfreedom might have been observed that is had there been aspectator in the field the justification of the push he hadapplied however and of the push equally sharp that to shuthimself in he again applied the ground of this energy wasprecisely that he might here however briefly find himselfalone alone with the handful of letters newspapers and otherunopened missives to which during and since breakfast he hadlacked opportunity to give an eye the vast square cleanapartment was empty and its large clear windows looked out intospaces of terrace and garden of park and woodland and shiningartificial lake of

tortuouscorridors investing him with an interest that makes ourattention tender indeed almost to compassion qualify hisachieved isolation for it may immediately be mentioned that thisamiable man bethought himself of his personal advantage ingeneral only when it might appear to him that other advantages those of other persons had successfully put in their claim itmay be mentioned also that he always figured other persons suchwas the law of his nature as a numerous array and that thoughconscious of but a single near tie one affection one dutydeepest rooted in his life it had never for many minutestogether been his portion not to feel himself surrounded andcommitted never quite been his refreshment to make out where themany coloured human appeal represented by gradations of tint diminishing concentric zones of intensity of importunity reallyfaded to the blessed impersonal whiteness for which his visionsometimes ached it shaded off the appeal he would haveadmitted that but he had as yet noted no point at which itpositively stopped thus had grown in him a little habit his innermost secret notconfided even to maggie though he felt she understood it as sheunderstood to his view everything thus had shaped itself theinnocent trick of occasionally making believe that he had noconscience or at least that blankness in the field of duty didreign for an hour a small game to

insolent in one field and accessibility todistraction in every other variety of imagination what is thatbut fatal in the world of affairs unless so disciplined as notto be distinguished from monotony mr verver then for a fresh full period a period betraying extraordinarily no wasted year had been inscrutably monotonous behind an iridescent cloud thecloud was his native envelope the soft looseness so to say ofhis temper and tone not directly expressive enough no doubt tofigure an amplitude of folds but of a quality unmistakable forsensitive feelers he was still reduced in fine to getting hisrare moments with himself by feigning a cynicism his realinability to maintain the pretence however had perhaps notoften been better instanced than by his acceptance of theinevitable to day his acceptance of it on the arrival at theend of a quarter of an hour of that element of obligation withwhich he had all the while known he must reckon a quarter of an hour of egoism was about as much as he taking one situation withanother usually got mrs rance opened the door moretentatively indeed than he himself had just done but on theother hand as if to make up for this she pushed forward evenmore briskly on seeing him than he had been moved to do on seeingnobody then with force it came home to him that he had definitely a week before established a precedent he did her atleast that justice it was a kind of justice he was always doingsomeone he had on the previous sunday liked to stop at home andhe had exposed himself thereby to be caught in the act to makethis possible that is mrs rance had only had to like to do thesame the trick was so easily played it had not occurred to himto plan in any way for her absence which would have destroyed somehow in principle the propriety of his own presence ifpersons under his roof hadn t a right not to go to church whatbecame for a fair mind of his own right his subtlest manoeuvrehad been simply to change from the library to the billiard room it being in the library that his guest or his daughter s or theguest of the miss lutches he scarce knew in which light toregard her had then and not unnaturally of course joined him it was urged on him by his memory of the duration of the visitshe had that time as it were paid him that the law ofrecurrence would already have got itself enacted she had spentthe whole morning with him was still there in the library whenthe others came back thanks to her having been tepid about theirtaking mr verver and she a turn outside it had been as if shelooked on that as a kind of subterfuge almost as a form ofdisloyalty yet what was it she had in mind what did she wish tomake of him beyond what she had already made a patient punctilious host mindful that she had originally arrived much asa stranger arrived not at all deliberately or yearninglyinvited so that one positively had her possiblesusceptibilities the more on one s conscience the miss lutches the sisters from the middle west were there as friends ofmaggie s friends of the earlier time but mrs rance was there or at least had primarily appeared only as a friend of the misslutches this lady herself was not of the middle west she rather insistedon it but of new jersey rhode island or delaware one of thesmallest and most intimate states he couldn t remember which though she insisted too on that it was not in him we may say itfor him to go so far as to wonder if their group were next to berecruited by some friend of her own and this partly because shehad struck him verily rather as wanting to get the miss lutchesthemselves away than to extend the actual circle and partly aswell as more essentially because such connection as he enjoyedwith the ironic question in general resided substantially less ina personal use of it than in the habit of seeing it as easy toothers he was so framed by nature as to be able to keep hisinconveniences separate from his resentments though indeed ifthe sum of these latter had at the most always been small thatwas doubtless in some degree a consequence of the fewness of theformer his greatest inconvenience he would have admitted hadhe analyzed was in finding it so taken for granted that as hehad money he had force it pressed upon him hard and all round assuredly this attribution of power everyone had need of one spower whereas one s own need at the best would have seemed tobe but some trick for not communicating it the effect of areserve so merely so meanly defensive would in most cases beyond question sufficiently discredit the cause wherefore though it was complicating to be perpetually treated as aninfinite agent the outrage was not the greatest of which a braveman might complain complaint besides was a luxury and hedreaded the imputation of greed the other the constantimputation that of being able to do would have no ground ifhe hadn t been to start with this was the point provablyluxurious his lips somehow were closed and by a springconnected moreover with the action of his eyes themselves thelatter showed him what he had done showed him where he had comeout quite at the top of his hill of difficulty the tall sharpspiral round which he had begun to wind his ascent at the age oftwenty and the apex of which was a platform looking down if onewould on the kingdoms of the earth and with standing room forbut half a dozen others his eyes in any case now saw mrs rance approach with aninstant failure to attach to the fact any grossness of avidity ofmrs rance s own or at least to descry any triumphant use evenfor the luridest impression of her intensity what was virtuallysupreme would be her vision of his having attempted by hisdesertion of the library to mislead her which in point of factbarely escaped being what he had designed it was not easy forhim in spite of accumulations fondly and funnily regarded as ofsystematic practice not now to be ashamed the one thingcomparatively easy would be to gloss over his course thebilliard room was not at the particular crisis either a naturalor a graceful place for the nominally main occupant of so large ahouse to retire to and this without prejudice either to thefact that his visitor wouldn t as he apprehended explicitlymake him a scene should she frankly denounce him for a sneak hewould simply go to pieces but he was after an instant notafraid of that wouldn t she rather as emphasising theircommunion accept and in a manner exploit the anomaly treat itperhaps as romantic or possibly even as comic show at leastthat they needn t mind even though the vast table draped inbrown holland thrust itself between them as an expanse of desertsand she couldn t cross the desert but she could and did beautifully get round it so that for him to convert it into anobstacle he would have had to cause himself as in some childishgame or unbecoming romp to be pursued to be genially hunted this last was a turn he was well aware the occasion should on noaccount take and there loomed before him for the mere moment the prospect of her fairly proposing that they should knock aboutthe balls that danger certainly it struck him he should managein some way to deal with why too for that matter had he needof defences material or other how was it a question of dangersreally to be called such the deep danger the only one that madehim as an idea positively turn cold would have been thepossibility of her seeking him in marriage of her bringing upbetween them that terrible issue here fortunately she waspowerless it being apparently so provable against her that shehad a husband in undiminished existence she had him it was true only in america only in texas innebraska in arizona or somewhere somewhere that at old fawnshouse in the county of kent scarcely counted as a definiteplace at all it showed somehow from afar as so lost soindistinct and illusory in the great alkali desert of cheapdivorce she had him even in bondage poor man had him incontempt had him in remembrance so imperfect as barely to assertitself but she had him none the less in existence unimpeached the miss lutches had seen him in the flesh as they had appearedeager to mention though when they were separately questionedtheir descriptions failed to tally he would be at the worst should it come to the worst mrs rance s difficulty and heserved therefore quite enough as the stout bulwark of anyoneelse this was in truth logic without a flaw yet it gave mr verver less comfort than it ought he feared not only danger hefeared the idea of danger or in other words feared hauntedly himself it was above all as a symbol that mrs rance actuallyrose before him a symbol of the supreme effort that he shouldhave sooner or later as he felt to make this effort would beto say no he lived in terror of having to he should be proposedto at a given moment it was only a question of time and then heshould have to do a thing that would be extremely disagreeable he almost wished on occasion that he wasn t so sure he would doit he knew himself however well enough not to doubt he knewcoldly quite bleakly where he would at the crisis draw theline it was maggie s marriage and maggie s finer happiness happy as he had supposed her before that had made thedifference he hadn t in the other time it now seemed to him had to think of such things they hadn t come up for him and itwas as if she positively had herself kept them down she hadonly been his child which she was indeed as much as ever butthere were sides on which she had protected him as if she weremore than a daughter she had done for him more than he knew much and blissfully as he always had known if she did atpresent more than ever through having what she called the changein his life to make up to him for his situation still all thesame kept pace with her activity his situation being simplythat there was more than ever to be done there had not yet been quite so much on all the showing assince their return from their twenty months in america as sincetheir settlement again in england experimental though it was and the consequent sense now quite established for him of adomestic air that had cleared and lightened producing theeffect for their common personal life of wider perspectives andlarge waiting spaces it was as if his son in law s presence even from before his becoming his son in law had somehow filledthe scene and blocked the future very richly and handsomely when all was said not at all inconveniently or in ways not tohave been desired inasmuch as though the prince his measure nowpractically taken was still pretty much the same big fact thesky had lifted the horizon receded the very foreground itselfexpanded quite to match him quite to keep everything incomfortable scale at first certainly their decent littleold time union maggie s and his own had resembled a good dealsome pleasant public square in the heart of an old city intowhich a great palladian church say something with a grandarchitectural front had suddenly been dropped so that the restof the place the space in front the way round outside to theeast end the margin of street and passage the quantity ofover arching heaven had been temporarily compromised not eventhen of a truth in a manner disconcerting given that is forthe critical or at least the intelligent eye the great styleof the facade and its high place in its class the phenomenonthat had since occurred whether originally to have beenpronounced calculable or not had not naturally been themiracle of a night but had taken place so gradually quietly easily that from this vantage of wide wooded fawns with itseighty rooms as they said with its spreading park with its acres and acres of garden and its majesty of artificial lake though that for a person so familiar with the great ones might be rather ridiculous no visibility of transition showed no violence of adjustment in retrospect emerged the palladianchurch was always there but the piazza took care of itself thesun stared down in his fulness the air circulated and thepublic not less the limit stood off the way round was easy theeast end was as fine in its fashion as the west and there werealso side doors for entrance between the two large monumental ornamental in their style as for all proper great churches bysome such process in fine had the prince for his father in law while remaining solidly a feature ceased to be at allominously a block mr verver it may further be mentioned had taken at no momentsufficient alarm to have kept in detail the record of hisreassurance but he would none the less not have been unable notreally have been indisposed to impart in confidence to the rightperson his notion of the history of the matter the rightperson it is equally distinct had not for this illumination been wanting but had been encountered in the form of fannyassingham not for the first time indeed admitted to hiscounsels and who would have doubtless at present in any case from plenitude of interest and with equal guarantees repeatedhis secret it all came then the great clearance from the oneprime fact that the prince by good fortune hadn t provedangular he clung to that description of his daughter s husbandas he often did to terms and phrases in the human the socialconnection that he had found for himself it was his way to havetimes of using these constantly as if they just then lighted theworld or his own path in it for him even when for some of hisinterlocutors they covered less ground it was true that withmrs assingham he never felt quite sure of the ground anythingcovered she disputed with him so little agreed with him somuch surrounded him with such systematic consideration suchpredetermined tenderness that it was almost which he had oncetold her in irritation as if she were nursing a sick baby hehad accused her of not taking him seriously and she hadreplied as from her it couldn t frighten him that she took himreligiously adoringly she had laughed again as she had laughedbefore on his producing for her that good right word about thehappy issue of his connection with the prince with an effect themore odd perhaps as she had not contested its value she couldn tof course however be at the best as much in love with hisdiscovery as he was himself he was so much so that he fairlyworked it to his own comfort came in fact sometimes nearpublicly pointing the moral of what might have occurred iffriction so to speak had occurred he pointed it frankly oneday to the personage in question mentioned to the prince theparticular justice he did him was even explicit as to the dangerthat in their remarkable relation they had thus escaped oh if he had been angular who could say what might then havehappened he spoke and it was the way he had spoken to mrs assingham too as if he grasped the facts without exception forwhich angularity stood it figured for him clearly as a final idea a conception of thelast vividness he might have been signifying by it the sharpcorners and hard edges all the stony pointedness the grandright geometry of his spreading palladian church just so he wasinsensible to no feature of the felicity of a contact that beguilingly almost confoundingly was a contact but withpractically yielding lines and curved surfaces you re round myboy he had said you re all you re variously andinexhaustibly round when you might by all the chances havebeen abominably square i m not sure for that matter he hadadded that you re not square in the general mass whetherabominably or not the abomination isn t a question for you reinveterately round that s what i mean in the detail it s thesort of thing in you that one feels or at least i do withone s hand say you had been formed all over in a lot of littlepyramidal lozenges like that wonderful side of the ducal palacein venice so lovely in a building but so damnable for rubbingagainst in a man and especially in a near relation i can seethem all from here each of them sticking out by itself all thearchitectural cut diamonds that would have scratched one s softersides one would have been scratched by diamonds doubtless theneatest way if one was to be scratched at all but one would havebeen more or less reduced to a hash as it is for living with you re a pure and perfect crystal i give you my idea i thinkyou ought to have it just as it has come to me the prince hadtaken the idea in his way for he was well accustomed by thistime to taking and nothing perhaps even could more haveconfirmed mr verver s account of his surface than the manner inwhich these golden drops evenly flowed over it they caught in nointerstice they gathered in no concavity the uniform smoothnessbetrayed the dew but by showing for the moment a richer tone theyoung man in other words unconfusedly smiled though indeed asif assenting from principle and habit to more than heunderstood he liked all signs that things were well but hecared rather less why they were in regard to the people among whom he had since his marriage beenliving the reasons they so frequently gave so much oftener thanhe had ever heard reasons given before remained on the whole theelement by which he most differed from them and his father in law and his wife were after all only first among the peopleamong whom he had been living he was never even yet sure of how at this that or the other point he would strike them they feltremarkably so often things he hadn t meant and missed not lessremarkably and not less often things he had he had fallenback on his general explanation we haven t the same values bywhich he understood the same measure of importance his curves apparently were important because they had been unexpected or still more unconceived whereas when one had always as in hisrelegated old world taken curves and in much greater quantitiestoo for granted one was no more surprised at the resultingfeasibility of intercourse than one was surprised at beingupstairs in a house that had a staircase he had in fact on thisoccasion disposed alertly enough of the subject of mr verver sapprobation the promptitude of his answer we may in fact wellsurmise had sprung not a little from a particular kindledremembrance this had given his acknowledgment its easiest turn oh if i m a crystal i m delighted that i m a perfect one for ibelieve that they sometimes have cracks and flaws in which casethey re to be had very cheap he had stopped short of theemphasis it would have given his joke to add that there had beencertainly no having him cheap and it was doubtless a mark of thegood taste practically reigning between them that mr verver hadnot on his side either taken up the opportunity it is thelatter s relation to such aspects however that now mostconcerns us and the bearing of his pleased view of this absenceof friction upon amerigo s character as a representative preciousobject representative precious objects great ancient picturesand other works of art fine eminent pieces in gold in silver in enamel majolica ivory bronze had for a number of years somultiplied themselves round him and as a general challenge toacquisition and appreciation so engaged all the faculties of hismind that the instinct the particular sharpened appetite of thecollector had fairly served as a basis for his acceptance of theprince s suit over and above the signal fact of the impression made on maggieherself the aspirant to his daughter s hand showed somehow thegreat marks and signs stood before him with the highauthenticities he had learned to look for in pieces of the firstorder adam verver knew by this time knew thoroughly no man ineurope or in america he privately believed was less capable insuch estimates of vulgar mistakes he had never spoken ofhimself as infallible it was not his way but apart from thenatural affections he had acquainted himself with no greaterjoy of the intimately personal type than the joy of hisoriginally coming to feel and all so unexpectedly that he hadin him the spirit of the connoisseur he had like many otherpersons in the course of his reading been struck with keats ssonnet about stout cortez in the presence of the pacific but fewpersons probably had so devoutly fitted the poet s grand imageto a fact of experience it consorted so with mr verver sconsciousness of the way in which at a given moment he hadstared at his pacific that a couple of perusals of the immortallines had sufficed to stamp them in his memory his peak indarien was the sudden hour that had transformed his life thehour of his perceiving with a mute inward gasp akin to the lowmoan of apprehensive passion that a world was left him toconquer and that he might conquer it if he tried it had been aturning of the page of the book of life as if a leaf long inerthad moved at a touch and eagerly reversed had made such a stirof the air as sent up into his face the very breath of the goldenisles to rifle the golden isles had on the spot become thebusiness of his future and with the sweetness of it what wasmost wondrous of all still more even in the thought than in theact the thought was that of the affinity of genius or at leastof taste with something in himself with the dormantintelligence of which he had thus almost violently become awareand that affected him as changing by a mere revolution of thescrew his whole intellectual plane he was equal somehow withthe great seers the invokers and encouragers of beauty and hedidn t after all perhaps dangle so far below the great producersand creators he had been nothing of that kind before toodecidedly too dreadfully not but now he saw why he had beenwhat he had why he had failed and fallen short even in hugesuccess now he read into his career in one single magnificentnight the immense meaning it had waited for it was during his first visit to europe after the death of hiswife when his daughter was ten years old that the light in hismind had so broken and he had even made out at that time why on an earlier occasion the journey of his honeymoon year it hadstill been closely covered he had bought then so far as hehad been able but he had bought almost wholly for the frail fluttered creature at his side who had had her fancies decidedly but all for the art then wonderful to both of them of the rue de la paix the costly authenticities of dressmakersand jewellers her flutter pale disconcerted ghost as sheactually was a broken white flower tied round almostgrotesquely for his present sense with a huge satin bow of theboulevard her flutter had been mainly that of ribbons frillsand fine fabrics all funny pathetic evidence for memory ofthe bewilderments overtaking them as a bridal pair confrontedwith opportunity he could wince fairly still as he rememberedthe sense in which the poor girl s pressure had under his fondencouragement indeed been exerted in favour of purchase andcuriosity these were wandering images out of the earlier dusk that threw her back for his pity into a past more remote thanhe liked their common past their young affection to appear it would have had to be admitted to an insistent criticism thatmaggie s mother all too strangely had not so much failed offaith as of the right application of it since she had exercisedit eagerly and restlessly made it a pretext for innocentperversities in respect to which philosophic time was at last toreduce all groans to gentleness and they had loved each other sothat his own intelligence on the higher line had temporarilypaid for it the futilities the enormities the depravities ofdecoration and ingenuity that before his sense was unsealed she had made him think lovely musing reconsidering little manthat he was and addicted to silent pleasures as he wasaccessible to silent pains he even sometimes wondered what wouldhave become of his intelligence in the sphere in which it was tolearn more and more exclusively to play if his wife s influenceupon it had not been in the strange scheme of things sopromptly removed would she have led him altogether attached ashe was to her into the wilderness of mere mistakes would shehave prevented him from ever scaling his vertiginous peak orwould she otherwise have been able to accompany him to thateminence where he might have pointed out to her as cortez tohis companions the revelation vouchsafed no companion of cortezhad presumably been a real lady mr verver allowed that historicfact to determine his inference viiiwhat was at all events not permanently hidden from him was atruth much less invidious about his years of darkness it was thestrange scheme of things again the years of darkness had beenneeded to render possible the years of light a wiser hand thanhe at first knew had kept him hard at acquisition of one sort asa perfect preliminary to acquisition of another and thepreliminary would have been weak and wanting if the good faith ofit had been less his comparative blindness had made the goodfaith which in its turn had made the soil propitious for theflower of the supreme idea he had had to like forging andsweating he had had to like polishing and piling up his arms they were things at least he had had to believe he liked just ashe had believed he liked transcendent calculation and imaginativegambling all for themselves the creation of interests thatwere the extinction of other interests the livid vulgarity even of getting in or getting out first that had of coursebeen so far from really the case with the supreme idea all thewhile growing and striking deep under everything in the warm rich earth he had stood unknowing he had walked and workedwhere it was buried and the fact itself the fact of hisfortune would have been a barren fact enough if the first sharptender shoot had never struggled into day there on one side wasthe ugliness his middle time had been spared there on the other from all the portents was the beauty with which his age mightstill be crowned he was happier doubtless than he deserved but that when one was happy at all it was easy to be he hadwrought by devious ways but he had reached the place and whatwould ever have been straighter in any man s life than his way now of occupying it it hadn t merely his plan all thesanctions of civilization it was positively civilizationcondensed concrete consummate set down by his hands as a houseon a rock a house from whose open doors and windows open tograteful to thirsty millions the higher the highest knowledgewould shine out to bless the land in this house designed as agift primarily to the people of his adoptive city and nativestate the urgency of whose release from the bondage of uglinesshe was in a position to measure in this museum of museums apalace of art which was to show for compact as a greek temple wascompact a receptacle of treasures sifted to positive sanctity his spirit to day almost altogether lived making up as he wouldhave said for lost time and haunting the portico in anticipationof the final rites these would be the opening exercises the august dedication ofthe place his imagination he was well aware got over theground faster than his judgment there was much still to do forthe production of his first effect foundations were laid andwalls were rising the structure of the shell all determined butraw haste was forbidden him in a connection so intimate with thehighest effects of patience and piety he should belie himself bycompleting without a touch at least of the majesty of delay amonument to the religion he wished to propagate the exemplarypassion the passion for perfection at any price he was far fromknowing as yet where he would end but he was admirably definiteas to where he wouldn t begin he wouldn t begin with a smallshow he would begin with a

thecircumjacent commonwealths of comic matter in large lettering diurnally set up printed published folded and delivered atthe expense of his presumptuous emulation of the snail the snailhad become for him under this ironic suggestion the loveliestbeast in nature and his return to england of which we arepresent witnesses had not been unconnected with the appreciationso determined it marked what he liked to mark that he needed on the matter in question instruction from no one on earth acouple of years of europe again of renewed nearness to changesand chances refreshed sensibility to the currents of the market would fall in with the consistency of wisdom the particularshade of enlightened conviction that he wished to observe itdidn t look like much for a whole family to hang about waiting they being now since the birth of his grandson a whole family and there was henceforth only one ground in all the world hefelt on which the question of appearance would ever really againcount for him he cared that a work of art of price should looklike the master to whom it might perhaps be deceitfullyattributed but he had ceased on the whole to know any matter ofthe rest of life by its looks he took life in general higher up the stream so far as he wasnot actually taking it as a collector he was taking it decidedly as a grandfather in the way of precious small pieceshe had handled nothing so precious as the principino hisdaughter s first born whose italian designation endlessly amusedhim and whom he could manipulate and dandle already almost tossand catch again as he couldn t a correspondingly rare morsel ofan earlier pate tendre he could take the small clutching childfrom his nurse s arms with an iteration grimly discountenanced in respect to their contents by the glass doors of highcabinets something clearly beatific in this new relation had moreover without doubt confirmed for him the sense that none ofhis silent answers to public detraction to local vulgarity hadever been so legitimately straight as the mere element ofattitude reduce it he said to that in his easy weeks atfawns the element of attitude was all he wanted of these weeks and he was enjoying it on the spot even more than he had hoped enjoying it in spite of mrs rance and the miss lutches in spiteof the small worry of his belief that fanny assingham had reallysomething for him that she was keeping back in spite of his fullconsciousness overflowing the cup like a wine too generouslypoured that if he had consented to marry his daughter andthereby to make as it were the difference what surrounded himnow was exactly consent vivified marriage demonstrated thedifference in fine definitely made he could call back hisprior his own wedded consciousness it was not yet out of rangeof vague reflection he had supposed himself above all he hadsupposed his wife as married as anyone could be and yet hewondered if their state had deserved the name or their unionworn the beauty in the degree to which the couple now before himcarried the matter in especial since the birth of their boy innew york the grand climax of their recent american period brought to so right an issue the happy pair struck him as havingcarried it higher deeper further to where it ceased to concernhis imagination at any rate to follow them extraordinary beyond question was one branch of his characteristic mutewonderment it characterised above all with its subject beforeit his modesty the strange dim doubt waking up for him at theend of the years of whether maggie s mother had after all beencapable of the maximum the maximum of tenderness he meant asthe terms existed for him the maximum of immersion in the factof being married maggie herself was capable maggie herself atthis season was exquisitely divinely the maximum such wasthe impression that positively holding off a little for thepractical the tactful consideration it inspired in him arespect for the beauty and sanctity of it almost amounting to awe such was the impression he daily received from her she was hermother oh yes but her mother and something more it becomingthus a new light for him and in such a curious way too thatanything more than her mother should prove at this time of daypossible he could live over again at almost any quiet moment the longprocess of his introduction to his present interests anintroduction that had depended all on himself like the cheek of the young man who approaches a boss without credentials orpicks up an acquaintance makes even a real friend by speakingto a passer in the street his real friend in all the business was to have been his own mind with which nobody had put him inrelation he had knocked at the door of that essentially privatehouse and his call in truth had not been immediately answered so that when after waiting and coming back he had at last gotin it was twirling his hat as an embarrassed stranger or trying his keys as a thief at night he had gained confidenceonly with time but when he had taken real possession of theplace it had been never again to come away all of which successrepresented it must be allowed his one principle of pride pride in the mere original spring pride in his money would havebeen pride in something that had come in comparison so easily the right ground for elation was difficulty mastered and hisdifficulty thanks to his modesty had been to believe in hisfacility this was the problem he had worked out to itssolution the solution that was now doing more than all else tomake his feet settle and his days flush and when he wished tofeel good as they said at american city he had but to retracehis immense development that was what the whole thing came backto that the development had not been somebody s else passingfalsely accepted too ignobly for his to think how servile hemight have been was absolutely to respect himself was in fact as much as he liked to admire himself as free the very finestspring that ever responded to his touch was always there topress the memory of his freedom as dawning upon him like asunrise all pink and silver during a winter divided betweenflorence rome and naples some three years after his wife sdeath it was the hushed daybreak of the roman revelation inparticular that he could usually best recover with the way thatthere above all where the princes and popes had been beforehim his divination of his faculty most went to his head he wasa plain american citizen staying at an hotel where sometimes for days together there were twenty others like him but nopope no prince of them all had read a richer meaning hebelieved into the character of the patron of art he was ashamedof them really if he wasn t afraid and he had on the wholenever so climbed to the tip top as in judging over a perusal ofhermann grimm where julius ii and leo x were placed by theirtreatment of michael angelo far below the plain americancitizen in the case at least in which this personage happenednot to be too plain to be adam verver going to our friend shead moreover some of the results of such comparisons maydoubtless be described as having stayed there his freedom tosee of which the comparisons were part what could it do butsteadily grow and grow it came perhaps even too much to stand to him for all freedom since for example it was as much there as ever at the very timeof mrs rance s conspiring against him at fawns with thebilliard room and the sunday morning on the occasion round whichwe have perhaps drawn our circle too wide mrs rance at leastcontrolled practically each other license of the present and thenear future the license to pass the hour as he would have foundconvenient the license to stop remembering for a little that though if proposed to and not only by this aspirant but by anyother he wouldn t prove foolish the proof of wisdom was nonethe less in such a fashion rather cruelly conditioned thelicense in especial to proceed from his letters to his journalsand insulate orientate himself afresh by the sound over hisgained interval of the many mouthed monster the exercise ofwhose lungs he so constantly stimulated mrs rance remained withhim till the others came back from church and it was by thattime clearer than ever that his ordeal when it should arrive would be really most unpleasant his impression this was thepoint took somehow the form not so much of her wanting to presshome her own advantage as of her building better than she knew that is of her symbolising with virtual unconsciousness his ownspecial deficiency his unfortunate lack of a wife to whomapplications could be referred the applications thecontingencies with which mrs rance struck him as potentiallybristling were not of a sort really to be met by one s self and the possibility of them when his visitor said or as good assaid i m restrained you see because of mr rance and alsobecause i m proud and refined but if it wasn t for mr rance andfor my refinement and my pride the possibility of them i say turned to a great murmurous rustle of a volume to fill thefuture a rustle of petticoats of scented many paged letters of voices as to which distinguish themselves as they might fromeach other it mattered little in what part of the resoundingcountry they had learned to make themselves prevail theassinghams and the miss lutches had taken the walk through thepark to the little old church on the property that ourfriend had often found himself wishing he were able to transport as it stood for its simple sweetness in a glass case to one ofhis exhibitory halls while maggie had induced her husband notinveterate in such practices to make with her by carriage thesomewhat longer pilgrimage to the nearest altar modest though ithappened to be of the faith her own as it had been hermother s and as mr verver himself had been loosely willing always to let it be taken for his without the solid ease ofwhich making the stage firm and smooth the drama of hermarriage might not have been acted out what at last appeared to have happened however was that thedivided parties coming back at the same moment had met outsideand then drifted together from empty room to room yet not inmere aimless quest of the pair of companions they had left athome the quest had carried them to the door of the billiard room and their appearance as it opened to admit them determined for adam verver in the oddest way in the world a newand sharp perception it was really remarkable this perceptionexpanded on the spot as a flower one of the strangest might at a breath have suddenly opened the breath for that matter was more than anything else the look in his daughter s eyes thelook with which he saw her take in exactly what had occurred inher absence mrs rance s pursuit of him to this remote locality the spirit and the very form perfectly characteristic of hisacceptance of the complication the seal set in short unmistakably on one of maggie s anxieties the anxiety it wastrue would have been even though not imparted separatelyshared for fanny assingham s face was by the same stroke notat all thickly veiled for him and a queer light of a colourquite to match fairly glittered in the four fine eyes of themiss lutches each of these persons counting out that is theprince and the colonel who didn t care and who didn t even seethat the others did knew something or had at any rate had heridea the idea precisely that this was what mrs rance artfully biding her time would do the special shade ofapprehension on the part of the miss lutches might indeed havesuggested the vision of an energy supremely asserted it wasdroll in truth if one came to that the position of the misslutches they had themselves brought they had guilelesslyintroduced mrs rance strong in the fact of mr rance s havingbeen literally beheld of them and it was now for them positively as if their handful of flowers since mrs rance wasa handful had been but the vehicle of a dangerous snake mr verver fairly felt in the air the miss lutches imputation inthe intensity of which really his own propriety might have beeninvolved that none the less was but a flicker what made the realdifference as i have hinted was his mute passage with maggie his daughter s anxiety alone had depths and it opened out forhim the wider that it was altogether new when in their commonpast when till this moment had she shown a fear howeverdumbly for his individual life they had had fears together just as they had had joys but all of hers at least had beenfor what equally concerned them here of a sudden was a questionthat concerned him alone and the soundless explosion of itsomehow marked a date he was on her mind he was even in amanner on her hands as a distinct thing that is from being where he had always been merely deep in her heart and in herlife too deep down as it were to be disengaged contrasted oropposed in short objectively presented but time finally haddone it their relation was altered he saw again thedifference lighted for her this marked it to himself and itwasn t a question simply of a mrs rance the more or the less for maggie too at a stroke almost beneficently their visitorhad from being an inconvenience become a sign they had madevacant by their marriage his immediate foreground his personalprecinct they being the princess and the prince they had maderoom in it for others so others had become aware he becameaware himself for that matter during the minute maggie stoodthere before speaking and with the sense moreover of what hesaw her see he had the sense of what she saw him this last itmay be added would have been his intensest perception had therenot the next instant been more for him in fanny assingham herface couldn t keep it from him she had seen on top ofeverything in her quick way what they both were seeing ixso much mute communication was doubtless all this time marvellous and we may confess to having perhaps read into thescene prematurely a critical character that took longer todevelop yet the quiet hour of reunion enjoyed that afternoon bythe father and the daughter did really little else than deal withthe elements definitely presented to each in the vibrationproduced by the return of the church goers nothing allusive nothing at all insistent passed between them either before orimmediately after luncheon except indeed so far as their failuresoon again to meet might be itself an accident charged withreference the hour or two after luncheon and on sundays withespecial rigour for one of the domestic reasons of which itbelonged to maggie quite multitudinously to take account werehabitually spent by the princess with her little boy in whoseapartment she either frequently found her father alreadyestablished or was sooner or later joined by him his visit tohis grandson at some hour or other held its place in his day against all interventions and this without counting hisgrandson s visits to him scarcely less ordered and timed andthe odd bits as he called them that they picked up togetherwhen they could communions snatched for the most part on theterrace in the gardens or the park while the principino withmuch pomp and circumstance of perambulator parasol fine laceover veiling and incorruptible female attendance took the air in the private apartments which occupying in the great housethe larger part of a wing of their own were not much more easilyaccessible than if the place had been a royal palace and thesmall child an heir apparent in the nursery of nurseries thetalk at these instituted times was always so prevailingly withor about the master of the scene that other interests and othertopics had fairly learned to avoid the slighting and inadequatenotice there taken of them they came in at the best but asinvolved in the little boy s future his past or hiscomprehensive present never getting so much as a chance to pleadtheir own merits or to complain of being neglected nothingperhaps in truth had done more than this united participationto confirm in the elder parties that sense of a life not onlyuninterrupted but more deeply associated more largely combined of which on adam verver s behalf we have made some mention itwas of course an old story and a familiar idea that a beautifulbaby could take its place as a new link between a wife and ahusband but maggie and her father had with every ingenuity converted the precious creature into a link between a mamma and agrandpapa the principino for a chance spectator of thisprocess might have become by an untoward stroke a haplesshalf orphan with the place of immediate male parent swept bareand open to the next nearest sympathy they had no occasion thus the conjoined worshippers to talk ofwhat the prince might be or might do for his son the sum ofservice in his absence so completely filled itself out it wasnot in the least moreover that there was doubt of him for hewas conspicuously addicted to the manipulation of the child inthe frank italian way at such moments as he judged discreet inrespect to other claims conspicuously indeed that is formaggie who had more occasion on the whole to speak to herhusband of the extravagance of her father than to speak to herfather of the extravagance of her husband adam verver had allround in this connection his own serenity he was sure of hisson in law s auxiliary admiration admiration he meant of hisgrand son since to begin with what else had been at work butthe instinct or it might fairly have been the tradition of thelatter s making the child so solidly beautiful as to have to beadmired what contributed most to harmony in this play ofrelations however was the way the young man seemed to leave itto be gathered that tradition for tradition the grandpapa s ownwas not in any estimate to go for nothing a tradition orwhatever it was that had flowered prelusively in the princessherself well amerigo s very discretions were his way of takingaccount of it his discriminations in respect to his heir were in fine not more angular than any others to be observed in him and mr verver received perhaps from no source so distinct animpression of being for him an odd and important phenomenon as hereceived from this impunity of appropriation these unchallengednursery hours it was as if the grandpapa s special show of thecharacter were but another side for the observer to study another item for him to note it came back this latter personageknew to his own previous perception that of the prince sinability in any matter in which he was concerned to conclude the idiosyncrasy for him at each stage had to bedemonstrated on which however he admirably accepted it thislast was after all the point he really worked poor young man for acceptance since he worked so constantly for comprehension and how when you came to that could you know that a horsewouldn t shy at a brass band in a country road because itdidn t shy at a traction engine it might have been brought up totraction engines without having been brought up to brass bands little by little thus from month to month the prince waslearning what his wife s father had been brought up to and nowit could be checked off he had been brought up to the romanticview of principini who would have thought it and where would itall stop the only fear somewhat sharp for mr verver was acertain fear of disappointing him for strangeness he felt thatthe evidence he offered thus viewed was too much on thepositive side he didn t know he was learning and it was funnyfor him to how many things he had been brought up if the princecould only strike something to which he hadn t this wouldn t itseemed to him ruffle the smoothness and yet might a little add to the interest what was now clear at all events for the father and thedaughter was their simply knowing they wanted for the time tobe together at any cost as it were and their necessity soworked in them as to bear them out of the house in a quarterhidden from that in which their friends were gathered and causethem to wander unseen unfollowed along a covered walk in the old garden as it was called old with an antiquity of formalthings high box and shaped yew and expanses of brick wall thathad turned at once to purple and to pink they went out of a doorin the wall a door that had a slab with a date set above it but in the old multiplied lettering and then had beforethem a small white gate intensely white and clean amid all thegreenness through which they gradually passed to where some ofthe grandest trees spaciously clustered and where they would findone of the quietest places a bench had been placed long ago beneath a great oak that helped to crown a mild eminence and theground sank away below it to rise again opposite at a distancesufficient to enclose the solitude and figure a bosky horizon summer blissfully was with them yet and the low sun made asplash of light where it pierced the looser shade maggie comingdown to go out had brought a parasol which as over hercharming bare head she now handled it gave with the big strawhat that her father in these days always wore a good deal tippedback definite intention to their walk they knew the bench itwas sequestered they had praised it for that together before and liked the word and after they had begun to linger there theycould have smiled if they hadn t been really too serious and ifthe question hadn t so soon ceased to matter over the probablewonder of the others as to what would have become of them the extent to which they enjoyed their indifference to anyjudgment of their want of ceremony what did that of itself speakbut for the way that as a rule they almost equally had otherson their mind they each knew that both were full of thesuperstition of not hurting but might precisely have beenasking themselves asking in fact each other at this moment whether that was to be after all the last word of theirconscientious development certain it was at all events that in addition to the assinghams and the lutches and mrs rance theattendance at tea just in the right place on the west terrace might perfectly comprise the four or five persons among them thevery pretty the typically irish miss maddock vaunted announcedand now brought from the couple of other houses near enough oneof these the minor residence of their proprietor established thriftily while he hired out his ancestral home within sightand sense of his profit it was not less certain either that for once in a way the group in question must all take the caseas they found it fanny assingham at any time for that matter might perfectly be trusted to see mr verver and his daughter tosee their reputation for a decent friendliness through anymomentary danger might be trusted even to carry off theirabsence for amerigo for amerigo s possible funny italiananxiety amerigo always being as the princess was well aware conveniently amenable to this friend s explanations beguilements reassurances and perhaps in fact rather more thanless dependent on them as his new life since that was his ownname for it opened out it was no secret to maggie it wasindeed positively a public joke for her that she couldn texplain as mrs assingham did and that the prince likingexplanations liking them almost as if he collected them in themanner of book plates or postage stamps for themselves hisrequisition of this luxury had to be met he didn t seem to wantthem as yet for use rather for ornament and amusement innocentamusement of the kind he most fancied and that was socharacteristic of his blessed beautiful general slightlyindolent lack of more dissipated or even just of moresophisticated tastes however that might be the dear woman had come to be frankly andgaily recognised and not least by herself as filling in theintimate little circle an office that was not always a sinecure it was almost as if she had taken with her kind melancholycolonel at her heels a responsible engagement to be withincall as it were for all those appeals that sprang out of talk that sprang not a little doubtless too out of leisure itnaturally led her position in the household as she called it to considerable frequency of presence to visits from the goodcouple freely repeated and prolonged and not so much as underform of protest she was there to keep him quiet it wasamerigo s own description of her influence and it would onlyhave needed a more visible disposition to unrest in himto make the account perfectly fit fanny herself limited indeed she minimised her office you didn t need a jailor shecontended for a domesticated lamb tied up with pink ribbon thiswas not an animal to be controlled it was an animal to be atthe most educated she admitted accordingly that she waseducative which maggie was so aware that she herself inevitably wasn t so it came round to being true that what shewas most in charge of was his mere intelligence this left goodness knew plenty of different calls for maggie to meet in acase in which so much pink ribbon as it might be symbolicallynamed was lavished on the creature what it all amounted to atany rate was that mrs assingham would be keeping him quiet now while his wife and his father in law carried out their own littlefrugal picnic quite moreover doubtless not much less neededlyin respect to the members of the circle that were with them therethan in respect to the pair they were missing almost for thefirst time it was present to maggie that the prince could bear when he was with his wife almost any queerness on the part ofpeople strange english types who bored him beyond convenience by being so little as he himself was for this was one of theways in which a wife was practically sustaining but she was aspositively aware that she hadn t yet learned to see him asmeeting such exposure in her absence how did he move and talk how above all did he or how would he look he who with his sonobly handsome face could look such wonderful things in case ofbeing left alone with some of the subjects of his wonder therewere subjects for wonder among these very neighbours only maggieherself had her own odd way which didn t moreover the leastirritate him of really liking them in proportion as they couldstrike her as strange it came out in her by heredity he amusedhimself with declaring this love of chinoiseries but sheactually this evening didn t mind he might deal with her chineseas he could maggie indeed would always have had for such moments had theyoftener occurred the impression made on her by a word of mrs assingham s a word referring precisely to that appetite inamerigo for the explanatory which we have just found in our path it wasn t that the princess could be indebted to another person even to so clever a one as this friend for seeing anything inher husband that she mightn t see unaided but she had ever hitherto been of a nature to accept with modest gratitude anybetter description of a felt truth than her little limits terribly marked she knew in the direction of saying the rightthings enabled her to make thus it was at any rate that shewas able to live more or less in the light of the fact expressedso lucidly by their common comforter the fact that the princewas saving up for some very mysterious but very fine eventualpurpose all the wisdom all the answers to his questions allthe impressions and generalisations he gathered putting themaway and packing them down because he wanted his great gun to beloaded to the brim on the day he should decide to let it off hewanted first to make sure of the whole of the subject that wasunrolling itself before him after which the innumerable facts hehad collected would find their use he knew what he was about trust him at last therefore to make and to some effect his bignoise and mrs assingham had repeated that he knew what he wasabout it was the happy form of this assurance that had remainedwith maggie it could always come in for her that amerigo knewwhat he was about he might at moments seem vague seem absent seem even bored this when away from her father with whom itwas impossible for him to appear anything but respectfullyoccupied he let his native gaiety go in outbreaks of song oreven of quite whimsical senseless sound either expressive ofintimate relaxation or else fantastically plaintive he might attimes reflect with the frankest lucidity on the circumstance thatthe case was for a good while yet absolutely settled in regard towhat he still had left at home of his very own in regard tothe main seat of his affection the house in rome the big blackpalace the palazzo nero as he was fond of naming it and alsoon the question of the villa in the sabine hills which she had at the time of their engagement seen and yearned over and thecastello proper described by him always as the perched place that had as she knew formerly stood up on the pedestal of itsmountain slope showing beautifully blue from afar as the headand front of the princedom he might rejoice in certain moodsover the so long estranged state of these properties not indeedall irreclaimably alienated but encumbered with unending leasesand charges with obstinate occupants with impossibilities ofuse all without counting the cloud of mortgages that had fromfar back buried them beneath the ashes of rage and remorse ashroud as thick as the layer once resting on the towns at thefoot of vesuvius and actually making of any present restorativeeffort a process much akin to slow excavation just so he mightwith another turn of his humour almost wail for these brightestspots of his lost paradise declaring that he was an idiot not tobe able to bring himself to face the sacrifices sacrificesresting if definitely anywhere with mr verver necessary forwinning them back one of the most comfortable things between the husband and thewife meanwhile one of those easy certitudes they could be merelygay about was that she never admired him so much or so foundhim heartbreakingly handsome clever irresistible in the verydegree in which he had originally and fatally dawned upon her aswhen she saw other women reduced to the same passive pulp thathad then begun once for all to constitute her substance therewas really nothing they had talked of together with more intimateand familiar pleasantry than of the license and privilege theboundless happy margin thus established for each she going sofar as to put it that even should he some day get drunk and beather the spectacle of him with hated rivals would after nomatter what extremity always for the sovereign charm of it charm of it in itself and as the exhibition of him that mostdeeply moved her suffice to bring her round what wouldtherefore be more open to him than to keep her in love with him he agreed with all his heart at these light moments that hiscourse wouldn t then be difficult inasmuch as so simplyconstituted as he was on all the precious question and whyshould he be ashamed of it he knew but one way with the fair they had to be fair and he was fastidious and particular hisstandard was high but when once this was the case what relationwith them was conceivable what relation was decent rudimentary properly human but that of a plain interest in the fairness hisinterest she always answered happened not to be plain andplainness all round had little to do with the matter which wasmarked on the contrary by the richest variety of colour butthe working basis at all events had been settled the missmaddocks of life been assured of their importance for him howconveniently assured maggie to take him too into the joke hadmore than once gone so far as to mention to her father since itfell in easily with the tenderness of her disposition to remembershe might occasionally make him happy by an intimate confidence this was one of her rules full as she was of little rules considerations provisions there were things she of coursecouldn t tell him in so many words about amerigo and herself andabout their happiness and their union and their deepest depths andthere were other things she needn t but there were also thosethat were both true and amusing both communicable and real andof these with her so conscious so delicately cultivated schemeof conduct as a daughter she could make her profit at will a pleasant hush for that matter had fallen on most of theelements while she lingered apart with her companion itinvolved this serenity innumerable complete assumptions sinceso ordered and so splendid a rest all the tokens spreadingabout them of confidence solidly supported might have suggestedfor persons of poorer pitch the very insolence of facility still they weren t insolent they weren t our pair couldreflect they were only blissful and grateful and personallymodest not ashamed of knowing with competence when greatthings were great when good things were good and when safethings were safe and not therefore placed below their fortuneby timidity which would have been as bad as being below it byimpudence worthy of it as they were and as each appears underour last possible analysis to have wished to make the other feelthat they were what they most finally exhaled into the eveningair as their eyes mildly met may well have been a kind ofhelplessness in their felicity their rightness thejustification of everything something they so felt the pulseof sat there with them but they might have been askingthemselves a little blankly to what further use they couldput anything so perfect they had created and nursed andestablished it they had housed it here in dignity and crowned itwith comfort but mightn t the moment possibly count for them orcount at least for us while we watch them with their fate allbefore them as the dawn of the discovery that it doesn t alwaysmeet all contingencies to be right otherwise why should maggiehave found a word of definite doubt the expression of the finepang determined in her a few hours before rise after a time toher lips she took so for granted moreover her companion sintelligence of her doubt that the mere vagueness of her questioncould say it all what is it after all that they want to do toyou they were for the princess too the hovering forces ofwhich mrs rance was the symbol and her father only smilingback now at his ease took no trouble to appear not to know whatshe meant what she meant when once she had spoken could comeout well enough though indeed it was nothing after they hadcome to the point that could serve as ground for a greatdefensive campaign the waters of talk spread a little andmaggie presently contributed an idea in saying what has reallyhappened is that the proportions for us are altered heaccepted equally for the time this somewhat cryptic remark hestill failed to challenge her even when she added that itwouldn t so much matter if he hadn t been so terribly young heuttered a sound of protest only when she went to declare that sheought as a daughter in common decency to have waited yet bythat time she was already herself admitting that she should havehad to wait long if she waited that is till he was old butthere was a way since you are an irresistible youth we ve gotto face it that somehow is what that woman has made me feel there ll be others xto talk of it thus appeared at last a positive relief to him yes there ll be others but you ll see me through she hesitated do you mean if you give in oh no through my holding out maggie waited again but when she spoke it had an effect ofabruptness why should you hold out forever he gave none the less no start and this as from the habit oftaking anything taking everything from her as harmonious butit was quite written upon him too for that matter that holdingout wouldn t be so very completely his natural or at any ratehis acquired form his appearance would have testified that hemight have to do so a long time for a man so greatly beset thisappearance that is spoke but little as yet of shortremainders and simplified senses and all in spite of his being asmall spare slightly stale person deprived of the generalprerogative of presence it was not by mass or weight or vulgarimmediate quantity that he would in the future any more than hehad done in the past insist or resist or prevail there was evensomething in him that made his position on any occasion madehis relation to any scene or to any group a matter of the backof the stage of an almost visibly conscious want of affinitywith the footlights he would have figured less than anything thestage manager or the author of the play who most occupy theforeground he might be at the best the financial backer watching his interests from the wing but in rather confessedignorance of the mysteries of mimicry barely taller than hisdaughter he pressed at no point on the presumed propriety of hisgreater stoutness he had lost early in life much of his crisp closely curling hair the fineness of which was repeated in asmall neat beard too compact to be called full though wornequally as for a mark where other marks were wanting on lip andcheek and chin his neat colourless face provided with themerely indispensable features suggested immediately for adescription that it was clear and in this manner somewhatresembled a small decent room clean swept and unencumbered withfurniture but drawing a particular advantage as might presentlybe noted from the outlook of a pair of ample and uncurtainedwindows there was something in adam verver s eyes that bothadmitted the morning and the evening in unusual quantities andgave the modest area the outward extension of a view that was big even when restricted to stars deeply and changeably blue though not romantically large they were yet youthfully almoststrangely beautiful with their ambiguity of your scarce knowingif they most carried their possessor s vision out or most openedthemselves to your own whatever you might feel they stamped theplace with their importance as the house agents say so that onone side or the other you were never out of their range weremoving about for possible community opportunity the sight ofyou scarce knew what either before them or behind them if otherimportances not to extend the question kept themselves down they were in no direction less obtruded than in that of ourfriend s dress adopted once for all as with a sort of sumptuaryscruple he wore every day of the year whatever the occasion the same little black cut away coat of the fashion of hisyounger time he wore the same cool looking trousers chequeredin black and white the proper harmony with which heinveterately considered was a sprigged blue satin necktie and over his concave little stomach quaintly indifferent to climatesand seasons a white duck waistcoat should you really he nowasked like me to marry he spoke as if coming from hisdaughter herself it might be an idea which for that matter hewould be ready to carry out should she definitely say so definite however just yet she was not prepared to be thoughit seemed to come to her with force as she thought that therewas a truth in the connection to utter what i feel is thatthere is somehow something that used to be right and that i vemade wrong it used to be right that you hadn t married and thatyou didn t seem to want to it used also she continued to makeout to seem easy for the question not to come up that s whati ve made different it does come up it will come up you don t think i can keep it down mr verver s tone wascheerfully pensive well i ve given you by my move all the trouble of having to he liked the tenderness of her idea and it made him as she satnear him pass his arm about her i guess i don t feel as if youhad moved very far you ve only moved next door well she continued i don t feel as if it were fair for mejust to have given you a push and left you so if i ve made thedifference for you i must think of the difference then what darling he indulgently asked do you think that s just what i don t yet know but i must find out we mustthink together as we ve always thought what i mean she wenton after a moment is that it strikes me that i ought to atleast offer you some alternative i ought to have worked one outfor you an alternative to what well to your simply missing what you ve lost without anythingbeing done about it but what have i lost she thought a minute as if it were difficult to say yet as ifshe more and more saw it well whatever it was that before kept us from thinking and kept you really as you might say inthe market it was as if you couldn t be in the market when youwere married to me or rather as if i kept people off innocently by being married to you now that i m married to someone else you re as in consequence married to nobody thereforeyou may be married to anybody to everybody people don t see whyyou shouldn t be married to them isn t it enough of a reason he mildly inquired that i don twant to be it s enough of a reason yes but to be enough of a reason ithas to be too much of a trouble i mean for you it has to be toomuch of a fight you ask me what you ve lost maggie continuedto explain the not having to take the trouble and to make thefight that s what you ve lost the advantage the happiness ofbeing just as you were because i was just as i was that swhat you miss so that you think her father presently said that i hadbetter get married just in order to be as i was before the detached tone of it detached as if innocently to amuse herby showing his desire to accommodate was so far successful as todraw from her gravity a short light laugh well what i don twant you to feel is that if you were to i shouldn t understand ishould understand that s all said the princess gently her companion turned it pleasantly over you don t go so far asto wish me to take somebody i don t like ah father she sighed you know how far i go how far i couldgo but i only wish that if you ever should like anybody you maynever doubt of my feeling how i ve brought you to it you llalways know that i know that it s my fault you mean he went on in his contemplative way that it will beyou who ll take the consequences maggie just considered i ll leave you all the good ones buti ll take the bad well that s handsome he emphasised his sense of it by drawingher closer and holding her more tenderly it s about all i couldexpect of you so far as you ve wronged me therefore we ll callit square i ll let you know in time if i see a prospect of yourhaving to take it up but am i to understand meanwhile he soonwent on that ready as you are to see me through my collapse you re not ready or not as ready to see me through myresistance i ve got to be a regular martyr before you ll beinspired she demurred at his way of putting it why if you like it youknow it won t be a collapse then why talk about seeing me through at all i shall onlycollapse if i do like it but what i seem to feel is that i don twant to like it that is he amended unless i feel surer i dothan appears very probable i don t want to have to think i likeit in a case when i really shan t i ve had to do that in somecases he confessed when it has been a question of otherthings i don t want he wound up to be made to make amistake ah but it s too dreadful she returned that you should evenhave to fear or just nervously to dream that you may be whatdoes that show after all she asked but that you do really well within feel a want what does it show but that you re trulysusceptible well it may show that he defended himself against nothing but it shows also i think that charming women are in the kindof life we re leading now numerous and formidable maggie entertained for a moment the proposition under cover ofwhich however she passed quickly from the general to theparticular do you feel mrs rance to be charming well i feel her to be formidable when they cast a spell itcomes to the same thing i think she d do anything oh well i d help you the princess said with decision asagainst her if that s all you require it s too funny she wenton before he again spoke that mrs rance should be here at all but if you talk of the life we lead much of it is altogether i m bound to say too funny the thing is maggie developedunder this impression that i don t think we lead as regardsother people any life at all we don t at any rate it seems tome lead half the life we might and so it seems i think toamerigo so it seems also i m sure to fanny assingham mr verver as if from due regard for these persons considered alittle what life would they like us to lead oh it s not a question i think on which they quite feeltogether she thinks dear fanny that we ought to be greater greater he echoed it vaguely and amerigo too you say ah yes her reply was prompt but amerigo doesn t mind hedoesn t care i mean what we do it s for us he considers tosee things exactly as we wish fanny herself maggie pursued thinks he s magnificent magnificent i mean for takingeverything as it is for accepting the social limitations ofour life for not missing what we don t give him mr verver attended then if he doesn t miss it his magnificenceis easy it is easy that s exactly what i think if there were things hedid miss and if in spite of them he were always sweet then nodoubt he would be a more or less unappreciated hero he could bea hero he will be one if it s ever necessary but it will beabout something better than our dreariness i know theprincess declared where he s magnificent and she rested aminute on that she ended however as she had begun we re not all the same committed to anything stupid if we ought to begrander as fanny thinks we can be grander there s nothing toprevent is it a strict moral obligation adam verver inquired no it s for the amusement for whose for fanny s own for everyone s though i dare say fanny s would be a largepart she hesitated she had now it might have appeared something more to bring out which she finally produced foryours in particular say if you go into the question she evenbravely followed it up i haven t really after all had tothink much to see that much more can be done for you than isdone mr verver uttered an odd vague sound don t you think a gooddeal is done when you come out and talk to me this way ah said his daughter smiling at him we make too much ofthat and then to explain that s good and it s natural butit isn t great we forget that we re as free as air well that s great mr verver pleaded great if we act on it not if we don t she continued to smile and he took her smile wondering again alittle by this time however struck more and more by anintensity in it that belied a light tone what do you want hedemanded to do to me and he added as she didn t say you vegot something in your mind it had come to him within the minutethat from the beginning of their session there she had beenkeeping something back and that an impression of this had morethan once in spite of his general theoretic respect for herpresent right to personal reserves and mysteries almost ceasedto be vague in him there had been from the first something inher anxious eyes in the way she occasionally lost herself thatit would perfectly explain he was therefore now quite sure you ve got something up your sleeve she had a silence that made him right well when i tell youyou ll understand it s only up my sleeve in the sense of beingin a letter i got this morning all day yes it has been in mymind i ve been asking myself if it were quite the right moment or in any way fair to ask you if you could stand just nowanother woman it relieved him a little yet the beautiful consideration of hermanner made it in a degree portentous stand one well mind her coming he stared then he laughed it depends on who she is there you see i ve at all events been thinking whether you dtake this particular person but as a worry the more whether that is you d go so far with her in your notion of having to bekind he gave at this the quickest shake to his foot how far would shego in her notion of it well his daughter returned you know how far in a generalway charlotte stant goes charlotte is she coming she writes me practically that she d like to if we re so goodas to ask her mr verver continued to gaze but rather as if waiting for more then as everything appeared to have come his expression had adrop if this was all it was simple then why in the world not maggie s face lighted anew but it was now another light itisn t a want of tact to ask her to propose it to you that i should ask her he put the question as an effect of his remnant of vagueness butthis had also its own effect maggie wondered an instant afterwhich as with a flush of recognition she took it up it wouldbe too beautiful if you would this clearly had not been her first idea the chance of hiswords had prompted it do you mean write to her myself yes it would be kind it would be quite beautiful of you thatis of course said maggie if you sincerely can he appeared to wonder an instant why he sincerely shouldn t andindeed for that matter where the question of sincerity came in this virtue between him and his daughter s friend had surelybeen taken for granted my dear child he returned i don tthink i m afraid of charlotte well that s just what it s lovely to have from you from themoment you re not the least little bit i ll immediately inviteher but where in the world is she he spoke as if he had notthought of charlotte nor so much as heard her name pronounced for a very long time he quite in fact amicably almost amusedly woke up to her she s in brittany at a little bathing place with some people idon t know she s always with people poor dear she rather hasto be even when as is sometimes the case they re people shedoesn t immensely like well i guess she likes us said adam verver yes fortunatelyshe likes us and if i wasn t afraid of spoiling it for you maggie added i d even mention that you re not the one of ournumber she likes least why should that spoil it for me oh my dear you know what else have we been talking about itcosts you so much to be liked that s why i hesitated to tell youof my letter he stared a moment as if the subject had suddenly grown out ofrecognition but charlotte on other visits never used to costme anything no only her keep maggie smiled then i don t think i mind her keep if that s all theprincess however it was clear wished to be thoroughlyconscientious well it may not be quite all if i think of itsbeing pleasant to have her it s because she will make adifference well what s the harm in that if it s but a difference for thebetter ah then there you are and the princess showed in her smileher small triumphant wisdom if you acknowledge a possibledifference for the better we re not after all so tremendouslyright as we are i mean we re not as satisfied and amused we dosee there are ways of being grander but will charlotte stant her father asked with surprise makeus grander maggie on this looking at him well had a remarkable reply yes i think really grander he thought for if this was a sudden opening he wished but themore to meet it because she s so handsome no father and the princess was almost solemn because she sso great great great in nature in character in spirit great in life so mr verver echoed what has she done in life well she has been brave and bright said maggie that mayn tsound like much but she has been so in the face of things thatmight well have made it too difficult for many other girls shehasn t a creature in the world really that is nearly belongingto her only acquaintances who in all sorts of ways make use ofher and distant relations who are so afraid she ll make use ofthem that they seldom let her look at them mr verver was struck and as usual to some purpose if we gether here to improve us don t we too then make use of her it pulled the princess up however but an instant we re old old friends we do her good too i should always even at theworst speaking for myself admire her still more than i usedher i see that always does good maggie hesitated certainly she knows it she knows i mean how great i think her courage and her cleverness she s notafraid not of anything and yet she no more ever takes a libertywith you than if she trembled for her life and then she sinteresting which plenty of other people with plenty of othermerits never are a bit in which fine flicker of visionthe truth widened to the princess s view i myself of coursedon t take liberties but then i do always by nature tremblefor my life that s the way i live oh i say love her father vaguely murmured yes i live in terror she insisted i m a small creepingthing you ll not persuade me that you re not as good as charlottestant he still placidly enough remarked i may be as good but i m not so great and that s what we retalking about she has a great imagination she has in everyway a great attitude she has above all a great conscience more perhaps than ever in her life before maggie addressed herfather at this moment with a shade of the absolute in her tone she had never come so near telling him what he should take itfrom her to believe she has only twopence in the world butthat has nothing to do with it or rather indeed she quicklycorrected herself it has everything for she doesn t care inever saw her do anything but laugh at her poverty her life hasbeen harder than anyone knows it was moreover as if thus unprecedentedly positive his childhad an effect upon him that mr verver really felt as a newthing why then haven t you told me about her before well haven t we always known i should have thought he submitted that we had alreadypretty well sized her up certainly we long ago quite took her for granted but thingschange with time and i seem to know that after this interval i m going to like her better than ever i ve lived more myself i m older and one judges better yes i m going to see incharlotte said the princess and speaking now as with high andfree expectation more than i ve ever seen then i ll try to do so too she was it came back to mr ververmore the one of your friends i thought the best for you his companion however was so launched in her permitted libertyof appreciation that she for the moment scarce heard him she waslost in the case she made out the vision of the different waysin which charlotte had distinguished herself she would have liked for instance i m sure she would have likedextremely to marry and nothing in general is more ridiculous even when it has been pathetic than a woman who has tried andhas not been able it had all mr verver s attention she has tried she has seen cases where she would have liked to but she has not been able well there are more cases in europe in which it doesn t cometo girls who are poor than in which it does come to them especially said maggie with her continued competence whenthey re americans well her father now met her and met her cheerfully on allsides unless you mean he suggested that when the girls areamerican there are more cases in which it comes to the rich thanto the poor she looked at him good humouredly that may be but i m notgoing to be smothered in my case it ought to make me if i werein danger of being a fool all the nicer to people likecharlotte it s not hard for me she practically explained notto be ridiculous unless in a very different way i might easilybe ridiculous i suppose by behaving as if i thought i had donea great thing charlotte at any rate has done nothing andanyone can see it and see also that it s rather strange and yetno one no one not awfully presumptuous or offensive would like or would dare to treat her just as she is as anything butquite right that s what it is to have something about you thatcarries things off mr verver s silence on this could only be a sign that she hadcaused her story to interest him though the sign when he spokewas perhaps even sharper and is it also what you mean bycharlotte s being great well said maggie it s one of her ways but she has many again for a little her father considered and who is it she hastried to marry maggie on her side as well waited as if to bring it out witheffect but she after a minute either renounced or encountered anobstacle i m afraid i m not sure then how do you know well i don t know and qualifying again she was earnestlyemphatic i only make it out for myself but you must make it out about someone in particular she had another pause i don t think i want even for myself toput names and times to pull away any veil i ve an idea therehas been more than once somebody i m not acquainted with andneedn t be or want to be in any case it s all over and beyondgiving her credit for everything it s none of my business mr verver deferred yet he discriminated i don t see how youcan give credit without knowing the facts can t i give it generally for dignity dignity i mean inmisfortune you ve got to postulate the misfortune first well said maggie i can do that isn t it always a misfortuneto be when you re so fine so wasted and yet she went on not to wail about it not to look even as if you knew it mr verver seemed at first to face this as a large question andthen after a little solicited by another view to let theappeal drop well she mustn t be wasted we won t at least havewaste it produced in maggie s face another gratitude then dear sir that s all i want and it would apparently have settled their question and endedtheir talk if her father had not after a little shown thedisposition to revert how many times are you supposing that shehas tried once more at this and as if she hadn t been couldn t be hatedto be in such delicate matters literal she was moved toattenuate oh i don t say she absolutely ever tried he looked perplexed but if she has so absolutely failed whatthen had she done she has suffered she has done that and the princess added she has loved and she has lost mr verver however still wondered but how many times maggie hesitated but it cleared up once is enough enough that is for one to be kind to her her father listened yet not challenging only as with a need ofsome basis on which under these new lights his bounty could befirm but has she told you nothing ah thank goodness no he stared then don t young women tell because you mean it s just what they re supposed to do shelooked at him flushed again now with which after anotherhesitation do young men tell she asked he gave a short laugh how do i know my dear what young mendo then how do i know father what vulgar girls do i see i see he quickly returned but she spoke the next moment as if she might odiously havebeen sharp what happens at least is that where there s a greatdeal of pride there s a great deal of silence i don t know iadmit what i should do if i were lonely and sore for whatsorrow to speak of have i ever had in my life i don t knoweven if i m proud it seems to me the question has never come upfor me oh i guess you re proud mag her father cheerfullyinterposed i mean i guess you re proud enough well then i hope i m humble enough too i might at all events for all i know be abject under a blow how can i tell do yourealise father that i ve never had the least blow he gave her a long quiet look who should realise if i don t well you ll realise when i have one she exclaimed with ashort laugh that resembled as for good reasons his own of aminute before i wouldn t in any case have let her tell me whatwould have been dreadful to me for such wounds and shames aredreadful at least she added catching herself up i supposethey are for what as i say do i know of them i don t want toknow she spoke quite with vehemence there are things thatare sacred whether they re joys or pains but one can always forsafety be kind she kept on one feels when that s right she had got up with these last words she stood there before himwith that particular suggestion in her aspect to which even thelong habit of their life together had not closed his sense keptsharp year after year by the collation of types and signs thecomparison of fine object with fine object of one degree offinish of one form of the exquisite with another the appearanceof some slight slim draped antique of vatican or capitolinehalls late and refined rare as a note and immortal as a link set in motion by the miraculous infusion of a modern impulse andyet for all the sudden freedom of folds and footsteps forsakenafter centuries by their pedestal keeping still the quality theperfect felicity of the statue the blurred absent eyes thesmoothed elegant nameless head the impersonal flit of acreature lost in an alien age and passing as an image in wornrelief round and round a precious vase she had always had oddmoments of striking him daughter of his very own though she was as a figure thus simplified generalised in its grace a figurewith which his human connection was fairly interrupted by somevague analogy of turn and attitude something shyly mythologicaland nymphlike the trick he was not uncomplacently aware wasmainly of his own mind it came from his caring for preciousvases only less than for precious daughters and what was more tothe point still it often operated while he was quite at the sametime conscious that maggie had been described even in herprettiness as prim mrs rance herself had enthusiasticallyused the word of her while he remembered that when once she hadbeen told before him familiarly that she resembled a nun shehad replied that she was delighted to hear it and would certainlytry to while also finally it was present to him that discreetly heedless thanks to her long association withnobleness in art to the leaps and bounds of fashion she broughther hair down very straight and flat over her temples in theconstant manner of her mother who had not been a bitmythological nymphs and nuns were certainly separate types butmr verver when he really amused himself let consistency go the play of vision was at all events so rooted in him that hecould receive impressions of sense even while positivelythinking he was positively thinking while maggie stood there and it led for him to yet another question which in its turn ledto others still do you regard the condition as hers then thatyou spoke of a minute ago the condition why that of having loved so intensely that she s as you say beyond everything maggie had scarcely to reflect her answer was so prompt oh no she s beyond nothing for she has had nothing i see you must have had things to be them it s a kind of lawof perspective maggie didn t know about the law but she continued definite she s not for example beyond help oh well then she shall have all we can give her i ll write toher he said with pleasure angel she answered as she gaily and tenderly looked at him true as this might be however there was one thing more he wasan angel with a human curiosity has she told you she likes memuch certainly she has told me but i won t pamper you let it beenough for you it has always been one of my reasons for likingher then she s indeed not beyond everything mr verver more orless humorously observed oh it isn t thank goodness that she s in love with you it snot as i told you at first the sort of thing for you to fear he had spoken with cheer but it appeared to drop before thisreassurance as if the latter overdid his alarm and that shouldbe corrected oh my dear i ve always thought of her as alittle girl ah she s not a little girl said the princess then i ll write to her as a brilliant woman it s exactly what she is mr verver had got up as he spoke and for a little beforeretracing their steps they stood looking at each other as ifthey had really arranged something they had come out togetherfor themselves but it had produced something more what it hadproduced was in fact expressed by the words with which he met hiscompanion s last emphasis well she has a famous friend in you princess maggie took this in it was too plain for a protest do you knowwhat i m really thinking of she asked he wondered with her eyes on him eyes of contentment at herfreedom now to talk and he wasn t such a fool he presentlyshowed as not suddenly to arrive at it why of your findingher at last yourself a husband good for you maggie smiled but it will take she added some looking then let me look right here with you her father said as theywalked on ximrs assingham and the colonel quitting fawns before the end ofseptember had come back later on and now a couple of weeksafter they were again interrupting their stay but this timewith the question of their return left to depend on matters thatwere rather hinted at than importunately named the lutches andmrs rance had also by the action of charlotte stant s arrival ceased to linger though with hopes and theories as to somepromptitude of renewal of which the lively expression awakeningthe echoes of the great stone paved oak panelled galleried hallthat was not the least interesting feature of the place seemedstill a property of the air it was on this admirable spot that before her october afternoon had waned fanny assingham spentwith her easy host a few moments which led to her announcing herown and her husband s final secession at the same time as theytempted her to point the moral of all vain reverberations thedouble door of the house stood open to an effect of hazy autumnsunshine a wonderful windless waiting golden hour under theinfluence of which adam verver met his genial friend as she cameto drop into the post box with her own hand a thick sheaf ofletters they presently thereafter left the house together anddrew out half an hour on the terrace in a manner they were torevert to in thought later on as that of persons who really hadbeen taking leave of each other at a parting of the ways hetraced his impression on coming to consider back to a merethree words she had begun by using about charlotte stant shesimply cleared them out those had been the three words thrownoff in reference to the general golden peace that the kentishoctober had gradually ushered in the halcyon days the fullbeauty of which had appeared to shine out for them aftercharlotte s arrival for it was during these days that mrs ranceand the miss lutches had been observed to be gathering themselvesfor departure and it was with that difference made that thesense of the whole situation showed most fair the sense of howright they had been to engage for so ample a residence and ofall the pleasure so fruity an autumn there could hold in its lap this was what had occurred that their lesson had been learned and what mrs assingham had dwelt upon was that without charlotteit would have been learned but half it would certainly not havebeen taught by mrs rance and the miss lutches if these ladieshad remained with them as long as at one time seemed probable charlotte s light intervention had thus become a cause operatingcovertly but none the less actively and fanny assingham sspeech which she had followed up a little echoed within him fairly to startle him as the indication of somethingirresistible he could see now how this superior force hadworked and he fairly liked to recover the sight little harm ashe dreamed of doing little ill as he dreamed of wishing thethree ladies whom he had after all entertained for a stiffishseries of days she had been so vague and quiet about it wonderful charlotte that he hadn t known what was happening happening that is as a result of her influence their fires as they felt her turned to smoke mrs assingham remarked which he was to reflect on indeed even while they strolled hehad retained since his long talk with maggie the talk that hadsettled the matter of his own direct invitation to her friend anodd little taste as he would have described it for hearingthings said about this young woman hearing so to speak whatcould be said about her almost as it her portrait by someeminent hand were going on so that he watched it grow under themultiplication of touches mrs assingham it struck him appliedtwo or three of the finest in their discussion of their youngfriend so different a figure now from that early playmate ofmaggie s as to whom he could almost recall from of old thedefinite occasions of his having paternally lumped the twochildren together in the recommendation that they shouldn t maketoo much noise nor eat too much jam his companion professed thatin the light of charlotte s prompt influence she had not been astranger to a pang of pity for their recent visitors i felt infact privately so sorry for them that i kept my impression tomyself while they were here wishing not to put the rest of youon the scent neither maggie nor the prince nor yourself noreven charlotte herself if you didn t happen to notice since youdidn t apparently i perhaps now strike you as extravagant buti m not i followed it all one saw the consciousness i speak ofcome over the poor things very much as i suppose people at thecourt of the borgias may have watched each other begin to lookqueer after having had the honour of taking wine with the headsof the family my comparison s only a little awkward for i don tin the least mean that charlotte was consciously dropping poisoninto their cup she was just herself their poison in the senseof mortally disagreeing with them but she didn t know it ah she didn t know it mr verver had asked with interest well i think she didn t mrs assingham had to admit that shehadn t pressingly sounded her i don t pretend to be sure inevery connection of what charlotte knows she doesn t certainly like to make people suffer not in general as is thecase with so many of us even other women she likes much ratherto put them at their ease with her she likes that is as allpleasant people do to be liked ah she likes to be liked her companion had gone on she did at the same time no doubt want to help us to put usat our ease that is she wanted to put you and to put maggieabout you so far as that went she had a plan but it was onlyafter it was not before i really believe that she saw howeffectively she could work again as mr verver felt he must have taken it up ah shewanted to help us wanted to help me why mrs assingham asked after an instant should it surpriseyou he just thought oh it doesn t she saw of course as soon as she came with her quickness where we all were she didn t need each of us to go byappointment to her room at night or take her out into thefields for our palpitating tale no doubt even she was ratherimpatient of the poor things mr verver had here inquired while hewaited well of your not yourselves being so and of your not inparticular i haven t the least doubt in the world par exemple that she thinks you too meek oh she thinks me too meek and she had been sent for on the very face of it to work rightin all she had to do after all was to be nice to you to a me said adam verver he could remember now that his friend had positively had a laughfor his tone to you and to every one she had only to be whatshe is and to be it all round if she s charming how can shehelp it so it was and so only that she acted as the borgiawine used to act one saw it come over them the extent to which in her particular way a woman a woman other and so other thanthemselves could be charming one saw them understand andexchange looks then one saw them lose heart and decide to move for what they had to take home was that it s she who s the realthing ah it s she who s the real thing as he had not hitherto takenit home as completely as the miss lutches and mrs rance so doubtless he had now a little appeared to offer submission inhis appeal i see i see he could at least simply take it homenow yet as not without wanting at the same time to be sure ofwhat the real thing was and what would it be a definitelythat you understand by that she had only for an instant not found it easy to say why exactly what those women themselves want to be and what hereffect on them is to make them recognise that they never will oh of course never it not only remained and abode with them it positively developedand deepened after this talk that the luxurious side of hispersonal existence was now again furnished socially speaking with the thing classed and stamped as real just as he had beenable to think of it as not otherwise enriched in consequence ofhis daughter s marriage the note of reality in so muchprojected light continued to have for him the charm and theimportance of which the maximum had occasionally been reached inhis great finds continued beyond any other to keep himattentive and gratified nothing perhaps might affect us asqueerer had we time to look into it than this application ofthe same measure of value to such different pieces of property asold persian carpets say and new human acquisitions all themore indeed that the amiable man was not without an inkling onhis own side that he was as a taster of life economicallyconstructed he put into his one little glass everything heraised to his lips and it was as if he had always carried in hispocket like a tool of his trade this receptacle a little glasscut with a fineness of which the art had long since been lost and kept in an old morocco case stamped in uneffaceable gilt withthe arms of a deposed dynasty as it had served him to satisfyhimself so to speak both about amerigo and about the bernadinoluini he had happened to come to knowledge of at the time he wasconsenting to the announcement of his daughter s betrothal so itserved him at present to satisfy himself about charlotte stantand an extraordinary set of oriental tiles of which he had latelygot wind to which a provoking legend was attached and as towhich he had made out contentedly that further news was to beobtained from a certain mr gutermann seuss of brighton it wasall at bottom in him the aesthetic principle planted where itcould burn with a cold still flame where it fed almost whollyon the material directly involved on the idea followed byappropriation of plastic beauty of the thing visibly perfect inits kind where in short in spite of the general tendency ofthe devouring element to spread the rest of his spiritualfurniture modest scattered and tended with unconscious care escaped the consumption that in so many cases proceeds from theundue keeping up of profane altar fires adam verver had in otherwords learnt the lesson of the senses to the end of his ownlittle book without having for a day raised the smallestscandal in his economy at large being in this particular notunlike those fortunate bachelors or other gentlemen of pleasure who so manage their entertainment of compromising company thateven the austerest housekeeper occupied and competent below stairs never feels obliged to give warning that figure has however a freedom that the occasion doubtlessscarce demands though we may retain it for its rough negativevalue it was to come to pass by a pressure applied to thesituation wholly from within that before the first ten days ofnovember had elapsed he found himself practically alone at fawnswith his young friend amerigo and maggie having with a certainabruptness invited his assent to their going abroad for a month since his amusement was now scarce less happily assured than hissecurity an impulse eminently natural had stirred within theprince his life as for some time established was deliciouslydull and thereby on the whole what he best liked but a smallgust of yearning had swept over him and maggie repeated to herfather with infinite admiration the pretty terms in which after it had lasted a little he had described to her thisexperience he called it a serenade a low music that outsideone of the windows of the sleeping house disturbed his rest atnight timid as it was and plaintive he yet couldn t close hiseyes for it and when finally rising on tiptoe he had lookedout he had recognised in the figure below with a mandolin allduskily draped in her grace the raised appealing eyes and theone irresistible voice of the ever to be loved italy sooner orlater that way one had to listen it was a hovering hauntingghost as of a creature to whom one had done a wrong a dim pathetic shade crying out to be comforted for this there wasobviously but one way as there were doubtless also many wordsfor the simple fact that so prime a roman had a fancy for againseeing rome they would accordingly hadn t they better go fora little maggie meanwhile making the too absurdly artful pointwith her father so that he repeated it in his amusement tocharlotte stant to whom he was by this time conscious ofaddressing many remarks that it was absolutely when she came tothink the first thing amerigo had ever asked of her shedoesn t count of course his having asked of her to marry him this was mr verver s indulgent criticism but he foundcharlotte equally touched by the ingenuous maggie in easyagreement with him over the question if the prince had askedsomething of his wife every day in the year this would be stillno reason why the poor dear man should not in a beautiful fit ofhomesickness revisit without reproach his native country what his father in law frankly counselled was that thereasonable the really too reasonable pair should while theywere about it take three or four weeks of paris as well parisbeing always for mr verver in any stress of sympathy asuggestion that rose of itself to the lips if they would only dothat on their way back or however they preferred it charlotteand he would go over to join them there for a small look thougheven then assuredly as he had it at heart to add not in theleast because they should have found themselves bored at beingleft together the fate of this last proposal indeed was that itreeled for the moment under an assault of destructive analysisfrom maggie who having as she granted to choose between beingan unnatural daughter or an unnatural mother and electing forthe former wanted to know what would become of the principino ifthe house were cleared of everyone but the servants her questionhad fairly resounded but it had afterwards like many of herquestions dropped still more effectively than it had risen thehighest moral of the matter being before the couple took theirdeparture that mrs noble and dr brady must mount unchallengedguard over the august little crib if she hadn t supremelybelieved in the majestic value of the nurse whose experience wasin itself the amplest of pillows just as her attention was aspreading canopy from which precedent and reminiscence dropped asthickly as parted curtains if she hadn t been able to rest inthis confidence she would fairly have sent her husband on hisjourney without her in the same manner if the sweetest for itwas so she qualified him of little country doctors hadn t provedto her his wisdom by rendering irresistible especially on rainydays and in direct proportion to the frequency of his calls adapted to all weathers that she should converse with him forhours over causes and consequences over what he had found toanswer with his little five at home she would have drawn scantsupport from the presence of a mere grandfather and a merebrilliant friend these persons accordingly her ownpredominance having thus for the time given way could carrywith a certain ease and above all with mutual aid theirconsciousness of a charge so far as their office weighed theycould help each other with it which was in fact to become asmrs noble herself loomed larger for them not a little of arelief and a diversion mr verver met his young friend at certain hours in theday nursery very much as he had regularly met the child s fondmother charlotte having as she clearly considered given maggieequal pledges and desiring never to fail of the last word for thedaily letter she had promised to write she wrote with highfidelity she let her companion know and the effect of it was remarkably enough that he himself didn t write the reason ofthis was partly that charlotte told all about him which shealso let him know she did and partly that he enjoyed feeling asa consequence that he was generally quite systematically easedand as they said done for committed as it were to thischarming and clever young woman who by becoming for him adomestic resource had become for him practically a new person and committed especially in his own house which somehow madehis sense of it a deeper thing he took an interest in seeing howfar the connection could carry him could perhaps even lead him and in thus putting to the test for pleasant verification whatfanny assingham had said at the last about the difference sucha girl could make she was really making one now in theirsimplified existence and a very considerable one though therewas no one to compare her with as there had been so usefully for fanny no mrs rance no kitty no dotty lutch to help herto be felt according to fanny s diagnosis as real she wasreal decidedly from other causes and mr verver grew in timeeven a little amused at the amount of machinery mrs assinghamhad seemed to see needed for pointing it she was directly andimmediately real real on a pleasantly reduced and intimatescale and at no moments more so than during those at which wehave just glanced when mrs noble made them both together feelthat she she alone in the absence of the queen mother wasregent of the realm and governess of the heir treated on suchoccasions as at best a pair of dangling and merely nominalcourt functionaries picturesque hereditary triflers entitled tothe petites entrees but quite external to the state which beganand ended with the nursery they could only retire in quickenedsociability to what was left them of the palace there to digesttheir gilded insignificance and cultivate in regard to the trueexecutive such snuff taking ironies as might belong to rococochamberlains moving among china lap dogs every evening after dinner charlotte stant played to him seated at the piano and requiring no music she went through his favourite things and he had many favourites with a facilitythat never failed or that failed but just enough to pick itselfup at a touch from his fitful voice she could play anything shecould play everything always shockingly she of course insisted but always by his own vague measure very much as if she might slim sinuous and strong and with practised passion have beenplaying lawn tennis or endlessly and rhythmically waltzing hislove of music unlike his other loves owned to vaguenesses butwhile on his comparatively shaded sofa and smoking smoking always smoking in the great fawns drawing room as everywhere the cigars of his youth rank with associations while i say heso listened to charlotte s piano where the score was ever absentbut between the lighted candles the picture distinct thevagueness spread itself about him like some boundless carpet asurface delightfully soft to the pressure of his interest it wasa manner of passing the time that rather replaced conversation but the air at the end none the less before they separated had a way of seeming full of the echoes of talk they separated in the hushed house not quite easily yet not quite awkwardlyeither with tapers that twinkled in the large dark spaces andfor the most part so late that the last solemn servant had beendismissed for the night late as it was on a particular evening toward the end of october there had been a full word or two dropped into the still stirringsea of other voices a word or two that affected our friend evenat the moment and rather oddly as louder and rounder than anyprevious sound and then he had lingered under pretext of anopened window to be made secure after taking leave of hiscompanion in the hall and watching her glimmer away up thestaircase he had for himself another impulse than to go to bed picking up a hat in the hall slipping his arms into a sleevelesscape and lighting still another cigar he turned out upon theterrace through one of the long drawing room windows and moved toand fro there for an hour beneath the sharp autumn stars it waswhere he had walked in the afternoon sun with fanny assingham and the sense of that other hour the sense of the suggestivewoman herself was before him again as in spite of all theprevious degustation we have hinted at it had not yet been hethought in a loose an almost agitated order of many things the power that was in them to agitate having been part of hisconviction that he should not soon sleep he truly felt for awhile that he should never sleep again till something had come tohim some light some idea some mere happy word perhaps that hehad begun to want but had been till now and especially the lastday or two vainly groping for can you really then come if westart early that was practically all he had said to the girlas she took up her bedroom light and why in the world not wheni ve nothing else to do and should besides so immensely likeit this had as definitely been on her side the limit of thelittle scene there had in fact been nothing to call a scene even of the littlest at all though he perhaps didn t quite knowwhy something like the menace of one hadn t proceeded from herstopping half way upstairs to turn and say as she looked down onhim that she promised to content herself for their journey with a toothbrush and a sponge there hovered about him at allevents while he walked appearances already familiar as well astwo or three that were new and not the least vivid of the formerconnected itself with that sense of being treated withconsideration which had become for him as we have noted one ofthe minor yet so far as there were any such quite one of thecompensatory incidents of being a father in law it had struckhim up to now that this particular balm was a mixture of whichamerigo as through some hereditary privilege alone possessedthe secret so that he found himself wondering if it had come to charlotte who had unmistakably acquired it through the youngman s having amiably passed it on she made use for her soquietly grateful host however this might be of quite the sameshades of attention and recognition was mistress in an equaldegree of the regulated the developed art of placing him high inthe scale of importance that was even for his own thought aclumsy way of expressing the element of similarity in theagreeable effect they each produced on him and it held him for alittle only because this coincidence in their felicity caused himvaguely to connect or associate them in the matter of tradition training tact or whatever else one might call it it mightalmost have been if such a link between them was to beimagined that amerigo had a little coached or incited theiryoung friend or perhaps rather that she had simply as one ofthe signs of the general perfection fanny assingham commended inher profited by observing during her short opportunity beforethe start of the travellers the pleasant application by theprince of his personal system he might wonder what exactly itwas that they so resembled each other in treating him like fromwhat noble and propagated convention in cases in which theexquisite importance was to be neither too grossly attributednor too grossly denied they had taken their specific lesson butthe difficulty was here of course that one could really neverknow couldn t know without having been one s self a personage whether a pope a king a president a peer a general or just abeautiful author before such a question as before several others when theyrecurred he would come to a pause leaning his arms on the oldparapet and losing himself in a far excursion he had as to somany of the matters in hand a divided view and this was exactlywhat made him reach out in his unrest for some idea lurking inthe vast freshness of the night at the breath of whichdisparities would submit to fusion and so spreading beneathhim make him feel that he floated what he kept finding himselfreturn to disturbingly enough was the reflection deeper thananything else that in forming a new and intimate tie he shouldin a manner abandon or at the best signally relegate hisdaughter he should reduce to definite form the idea that he hadlost her as was indeed inevitable by her own marriage heshould reduce to definite form the idea of his having incurred aninjury or at the best an inconvenience that required somemakeweight and deserved some amends and he should do this themore which was the great point that he should appear to adopt in doing it the sentiment in fact the very conviction entertained and quite sufficiently expressed by maggie herself in her beautiful generosity as to what he had suffered puttingit with extravagance at her hands if she put it withextravagance the extravagance was yet sincere for it came whichshe put with extravagance too from her persistence always inthinking feeling talking about him as young he had hadglimpses of moments when to hear her thus in her absolutelyunforced compunction one would have supposed the special edge ofthe wrong she had done him to consist in his having still beforehim years and years to groan under it she had sacrificed aparent the pearl of parents no older than herself it wouldn tso much have mattered if he had been of common parental age thathe wasn t that he was just her extraordinary equal andcontemporary this was what added to her act the long train ofits effect light broke for him at last indeed quite as aconsequence of the fear of breathing a chill upon this luxurianceof her spiritual garden as at a turn of his labyrinth he saw hisissue which opened out so wide for the minute that he held hisbreath with wonder he was afterwards to recall how just then the autumn night seemed to clear to a view in which the wholeplace everything round him the wide terrace where he stood theothers with their steps below the gardens the park the lake the circling woods lay there as under some strange midnight sun it all met him during these instants as a vast expanse ofdiscovery a world that looked so lighted extraordinarily new and in which familiar objects had taken on a distinctness that as if it had been a loud a spoken pretension to beauty interest importance to he scarce knew what gave them aninordinate quantity of character and verily an inordinate size this hallucination or whatever he might have called it wasbrief but it lasted long enough to leave him gasping the gaspof admiration had by this time however lost itself in anintensity that quickly followed the way the wonder of it sincewonder was in question truly had been the strange delay of hisvision he had these several days groped and groped for an objectthat lay at his feet and as to which his blindness came from hisstupidly looking beyond it had sat all the while at his hearth stone whence it now gazed up in his face once he had recognised it there everything became coherent thesharp point to which all his light converged was that the wholecall of his future to him as a father would be in his somanaging that maggie would less and less appear to herself tohave forsaken him and it not only wouldn t be decently humane decently possible not to make this relief easy to her the ideashone upon him more than that as exciting inspiring uplifting it fell in so beautifully with what might be otherwisepossible it stood there absolutely confronted with the materialway in which it might be met the way in which it might be metwas by his putting his child at peace and the way to put her atpeace was to provide for his future that is for hers bymarriage by a marriage as good speaking proportionately ashers had been as he fairly inhaled this measure of refreshmenthe tasted the meaning of recent agitations he had seen thatcharlotte could contribute what he hadn t seen was what shecould contribute to when it had all supremely cleared up and hehad simply settled this service to his daughter well before himas the proper direction of his young friend s leisure the cooldarkness had again closed round him but his moral lucidity wasconstituted it wasn t only moreover that the word with a click so fitted the riddle but that the riddle in such perfection fitted the word he might have been equally in want and yet nothave had his remedy oh if charlotte didn t accept him ofcourse the remedy would fail but as everything had fallentogether it was at least there to be tried and success would begreat that was his last throb if the measure of relief effectedfor maggie should at all prove to have been given by his ownactual sense of felicity he really didn t know when in his lifehe had thought of anything happier to think of it merely forhimself would have been even as he had just lately felt evendoing all justice to that condition yes impossible but therewas a grand difference in thinking of it for his child xiiit was at brighton above all that this difference came out itwas during the three wonderful days he spent there with charlottethat he had acquainted himself further though doubtless not evennow quite completely with the merits of his majestic scheme andwhile moreover to begin with he still but held his vision inplace steadying it fairly with his hands as he had oftensteadied for inspection a precarious old pot or kept a glazedpicture in its right relation to the light the other the outerpresumptions in his favour those independent of what he mighthimself contribute and that therefore till he should speak remained necessarily vague that quantity i say struck him aspositively multiplying as putting on in the fresh brighton airand on the sunny brighton front a kind of tempting palpability he liked in this preliminary stage to feel that he should beable to speak and that he would the word itself beingromantic pressing for him the spring of association with storiesand plays where handsome and ardent young men in uniforms tights cloaks high boots had it in soliloquies ever on theirlips and the sense on the first day that he should probably havetaken the great step before the second was over conduced alreadyto make him say to his companion that they must spend more thantheir mere night or two at his ease on the ground of what wasbefore him he at all events definitely desired to be and it wasstrongly his impression that he was proceeding step by step hewas acting it kept coming back to that not in the dark but inthe high golden morning not in precipitation flurry fever dangers these of the path of passion properly so called but withthe deliberation of a plan a plan that might be a thing of lessjoy than a passion but that probably would in compensation forthat loss be found to have the essential property to wear eventhe decent dignity of reaching further and of providing for morecontingencies the season was in local parlance on theelements were assembled the big windy hotel the draughty socialhall swarmed with types in charlotte s constant phrase andresounded with a din in which the wild music of gilded andbefrogged bands croatian dalmatian carpathian violentlyexotic and nostalgic was distinguished as struggling against theperpetual popping of corks much of this would decidedly havedisconcerted our friends if it hadn t all happened morepreponderantly to give them the brighter surprise the nobleprivacy of fawns had left them had left mr verver at least with a little accumulated sum of tolerance to spend on the highpitch and high colour of the public sphere fawns as it had beenfor him and as maggie and fanny assingham had both attested wasout of the world whereas the scene actually about him with thevery sea a mere big booming medium for excursions and aquariums affected him as so plump in the conscious centre that nothingcould have been more complete for representing that pulse of lifewhich they had come to unanimity at home on the subject of theiradvisedly not hereafter forgetting the pulse of life was whatcharlotte in her way at home had lately reproduced and therewere positively current hours when it might have been open to hercompanion to feel himself again indebted to her forintroductions he had brought her to put it crudely but itwas almost as if she were herself in her greater gaiety herlivelier curiosity and intensity her readier happier irony taking him about and showing him the place no one really whenhe came to think had ever taken him about before it had alwaysbeen he of old who took others and who in particular tookmaggie this quickly fell into its relation with him as part ofan experience marking for him no doubt what people call considerately a time of life a new and pleasant order aflattered passive state that might become why shouldn t it one of the comforts of the future mr gutermann seuss proved on the second day our friend hadwaited till then a remarkably genial a positively lustrousyoung man occupying a small neat house in a quarter of the placeremote from the front and living as immediate and striking signstestified in the bosom of his family our visitors foundthemselves introduced by the operation of close contiguity to anumerous group of ladies and gentlemen older and younger and ofchildren larger and smaller who mostly affected them as scarceless anointed for hospitality and who produced at first theimpression of a birthday party of some anniversary gregariouslyand religiously kept though they subsequently fell into theirplaces as members of one quiet domestic circle preponderantlyand directly indebted for their being in fact to mr gutermann seuss to the casual eye a mere smart and shining youthof less than thirty summers faultlessly appointed in everyparticular he yet stood among his progeny eleven in all as heconfessed without a sigh eleven little brown clear faces yetwith such impersonal old eyes astride of such impersonal oldnoses while he entertained the great american collector whom hehad so long hoped he might meet and whose charming companion the handsome frank familiar young lady presumably mrs verver noticed the graduated offspring noticed the fat ear ringedaunts and the glossy cockneyfied familiar uncles inimitable ofaccent and assumption and of an attitude of cruder intentionthan that of the head of the firm noticed the place in short noticed the treasure produced noticed everything as from thehabit of a person finding her account at any time according to awisdom well learned of life in almost any funny impression itreally came home to her friend on the spot that this free rangeof observation in her picking out the frequent funny withextraordinary promptness would verily henceforth make adifferent thing for him of such experiences of the customaryhunt for the possible prize the inquisitive play of his acceptedmonomania which different thing could probably be a lighter andperhaps thereby a somewhat more boisterously refreshing form ofsport such omens struck him as vivid in any case when mr gutermann seuss with a sharpness of discrimination he had atfirst scarce seemed to promise invited his eminent couple intoanother room before the threshold of which the rest of thetribe unanimously faltering dropped out of the scene thetreasure itself here the objects on behalf of which mr verver sinterest had been booked established quickly enough their claimto engage the latter s attention yet at what point of his pastdid our friend s memory looking back and back catch him in anysuch place thinking so much less of wares artfully paraded thanof some other and quite irrelevant presence such places were notstrange to him when they took the form of bourgeois back parlours a trifle ominously grey and grim from their northlight at watering places prevailingly homes of humbug or evenwhen they wore some aspect still less if not perhaps still more insidious he had been everywhere pried and prowled everywhere going on occasion so far as to risk he believed life healthand the very bloom of honour but where while precious things extracted one by one from thrice locked yet often vulgar drawersand soft satchels of old oriental ilk were impressively rangedbefore him had he till now let himself in consciousness wander like one of the vague he didn t betray it ah that he knew but two recognitions tookplace for him at once and one of them suffered a little insweetness by the confusion mr gutermann seuss had truly forthe crisis the putting down of his cards a rare manner he wasperfect master of what not to say to such a personage as mr verver while the particular importance that dispenses withchatter was diffused by his movements themselves his repeatedact of passage between a featureless mahogany meuble and a tableso virtuously disinterested as to look fairly smug under a cottoncloth of faded maroon and indigo all redolent of patriarchalteas the damascene tiles successively and oh so tenderly unmuffled and revealed lay there at last in their full harmonyand their venerable splendour but the tribute of appreciationand decision was while the spectator considered simplified to apoint that but just failed of representing levity on the part ofa man who had always acknowledged without shame in such affairs the intrinsic charm of what was called discussion the infinitelyancient the immemorial amethystine blue of the glaze scarcelymore meant to be breathed upon it would seem than the cheek ofroyalty this property of the ordered and matched array hadinevitably all its determination for him but his submission was perhaps for the first time in his life of the quick mind alone the process really itself in its way as fine as the perfectionperceived and admired every inch of the rest of him being givento the foreknowledge that an hour or two later he should have spoken the burning of his ships therefore waited too near tolet him handle his opportunity with his usual firm and sentientfingers waited somehow in the predominance of charlotte s veryperson in her being there exactly as she was capable as mr gutermann seuss himself was capable of the right felicity ofsilence but with an embracing ease through it all that madedeferred criticism as fragrant as some joy promised a lover byhis mistress or as a big bridal bouquet held patiently behindher he couldn t otherwise have explained surely why he foundhimself thinking to his enjoyment of so many other matters thanthe felicity of his acquisition and the figure of his cheque quite equally high any more than why later on with theirreturn to the room in which they had been received and therenewed encompassment of the tribe he felt quite merged in theelated circle formed by the girl s free response to thecollective caress of all the shining eyes and by her genialacceptance of the heavy cake and port wine that as she wasafterwards to note added to their transaction for a finish thetouch of some mystic rite of old jewry this characterisation came from her as they walked away walkedtogether in the waning afternoon back to the breezy sea and thebustling front back to the nimble and the flutter and theshining shops that sharpened the grin of solicitation on the maskof night they were walking thus as he felt nearer and nearerto where he should see his ships burn and it was meanwhile forhim quite as if this red glow would impart at the harmonioushour a lurid grandeur to his good faith it was meanwhile too asign of the kind of sensibility often playing up in him that fabulous as this truth may sound he found a sentimental link anobligation of delicacy or perhaps even one of the penalties ofits opposite in his having exposed her to the north light thequite properly hard business light of the room in which they hadbeen alone with the treasure and its master she had listened tothe name of the sum he was capable of looking in the face giventhe relation of intimacy with him she had already beyond allretractation accepted the stir of the air produced at the otherplace by that high figure struck him as a thing that from themoment she had exclaimed or protested as little as he himself hadapologised left him but one thing more to do a man of decentfeeling didn t thrust his money a huge lump of it in such away under a poor girl s nose a girl whose poverty was after afashion the very basis of her enjoyment of his hospitality without seeing logically a responsibility attached and thiswas to remain none the less true for the fact that twenty minuteslater after he had applied his torch applied it with a sign ortwo of insistence what might definitely result failed to beimmediately clear he had spoken spoken as they sat together onthe out of the way bench observed during one of their walks andkept for the previous quarter of the present hour well in hismemory s eye the particular spot to which between intensepauses and intenser advances he had all the while consistentlyled her below the great consolidated cliff well on to where thecity of stucco sat most architecturally perched with therumbling beach and the rising tide and the freshening stars infront and above the safe sense of the whole place yet prevailedin lamps and seats and flagged walks hovering also overhead inthe close neighbourhood of a great replete community about toassist anew at the removal of dish covers we ve had as it seems to me such quite beautiful daystogether that i hope it won t come to you too much as a shockwhen i ask if you think you could regard me with any satisfactionas a husband as if he had known she wouldn t she of coursecouldn t at all gracefully and whether or no reply with arush he had said a little more quite as he had felt he must inthinking it out in advance he had put the question on whichthere was no going back and which represented thereby thesacrifice of his vessels and what he further said was to standfor the redoubled thrust of flame that would make combustionsure this isn t sudden to me and i ve wondered at moments ifyou haven t felt me coming to it i ve been coming ever since weleft fawns i really started while we were there he spokeslowly giving her as he desired time to think all the morethat it was making her look at him steadily and making her also in a remarkable degree look well while she did so a largeand so far a happy consequence she wasn t at all eventsshocked which he had glanced at but for a handsome humility andhe would give her as many minutes as she liked you mustn tthink i m forgetting that i m not young oh that isn t so it s i that am old you are young this waswhat she had at first answered and quite in the tone too ofhaving taken her minutes it had not been wholly to the point but it had been kind which was what he most wanted and shekept for her next words to kindness kept to her clear loweredvoice and unshrinking face to me too it thoroughly seems thatthese days have been beautiful i shouldn t be grateful to themif i couldn t more or less have imagined their bringing us tothis she affected him somehow as if she had advanced a step tomeet him and yet were at the same time standing still it onlymeant however doubtless that she was gravely and reasonably thinking as he exactly desired to make her if she would butthink enough she would probably think to suit him it seems tome she went on that it s for you to be sure ah but i am sure said adam verver on matters of importancei never speak when i m not so if you can yourself face such aunion you needn t in the least trouble she had another pause and she might have been felt as facing itwhile through lamplight and dusk through the breath of themild slightly damp southwest she met his eyes without evasion yet she had at the end of another minute debated only to theextent of saying i won t pretend i don t think it would be goodfor me to marry good for me i mean she pursued because i mso awfully unattached i should like to be a little less adrift i should like to have a home i should like to have an existence i should like to have a motive for one thing more than another amotive outside of myself in fact she said so sincerely thatit almost showed pain yet so lucidly that it almost showedhumour in fact you know i want to be married it s well it s the condition the condition he was just vague it s the state i mean i don t like my own miss among usall is too dreadful except for a shopgirl i don t want to be ahorrible english old maid oh you want to be taken care of very well then i ll do it i dare say it s very much that only i don t see why for what ispeak of she smiled for a mere escape from my state i needdo quite so much so much as marry me in particular her smile was as for true directness i might get what i wantfor less you think it so much for you to do yes she presently said i think it s a great deal then it was that though she was so gentle so quite perfect withhim and he felt he had come on far then it was that of a suddensomething seemed to fail and he didn t quite know where theywere there rose for him with this the fact to be sure oftheir disparity deny it as mercifully and perversely as shewould he might have been her father of course yes that s mydisadvantage i m not the natural i m so far from being theideal match to your youth and your beauty i ve the drawback thatyou ve seen me always so inevitably in such another light but she gave a slow headshake that made contradiction soft madeit almost sad in fact as from having to be so complete and hehad already before she spoke the dim vision of some objectionin her mind beside which the one he had named was light andwhich therefore must be strangely deep you don t understand me it s of all that it is for you to do it s of that i m thinking oh with this for him the thing was clearer then you needn tthink i know enough what it is for me to do but she shook her head again i doubt if you know i doubt ifyou can and why not please when i ve had you so before me that i mold has at least that fact about it to the good that i ve knownyou long and from far back do you think you ve known me asked charlotte stant hehesitated for the tone of it and her look with it might havemade him doubt just these things in themselves however withall the rest with his fixed purpose now his committed deed thefine pink glow projected forward of his ships behind him definitely blazing and crackling this quantity was to push himharder than any word of her own could warn him all that she washerself moreover was so lighted to its advantage by the pinkglow he wasn t rabid but he wasn t either as a man of a properspirit to be frightened what is that then if i accept it butas strong a reason as i can want for just learning to know you she faced him always kept it up as for honesty and yet at thesame time in her odd way as for mercy how can you tellwhether if you did you would it was ambiguous for an instant as she showed she felt i meanwhen it s a question of learning one learns sometimes too late i think it s a question he promptly enough made answer ofliking you the more just for your saying these things you shouldmake something he added of my liking you i make everything but are you sure of having exhausted allother ways this of a truth enlarged his gaze but what other ways why you ve more ways of being kind than anyone i ever knew take it then he answered that i m simply putting them alltogether for you she looked at him on this long again stillas if it shouldn t be said she hadn t given him time or hadwithdrawn from his view so to speak a single inch of hersurface this at least she was fully to have exposed itrepresented her as oddly conscientious and he scarce knew inwhat sense it affected him on the whole however withadmiration you re very very honourable it s just what i want to be i don t see she added whyyou re not right i don t see why you re not happy as you are ican not ask myself i can not ask you she went on if you rereally as much at liberty as your universal generosity leads youto assume oughtn t we she asked to think a little of others oughtn t i at least in loyalty at any rate in delicacy tothink of maggie with which intensely gentle so as not toappear too much to teach him his duty she explained she severything to you she has always been are you so certain thatthere s room in your life for another daughter is that what you mean she had not hungupon it long but he had quickly taken her up he had not however disconcerted her for another young woman very much of her age and whose relation to her has always beenso different from what our marrying would make it for anothercompanion said charlotte stant can t a man be all his life then he almost fiercely asked anything but a father but he went on before she could answer you talk about differences but they ve been already made as noone knows better than maggie she feels the one she made herselfby her own marriage made i mean for me she constantly thinksof it it allows her no rest to put her at peace is therefore he explained what i m trying with you to do i can t do italone but i can do it with your help you can make her hesaid positively happy about me about you she thoughtfully echoed but what can i make herabout herself oh if she s at ease about me the rest will take care of itself the case he declared is in your hands you ll effectually putout of her mind that i feel she has abandoned me interest certainly now was what he had kindled in her face butit was all the more honourable to her as he had just called itthat she should want to see each of the steps of his conviction if you ve been driven to the likes of me mayn t it show thatyou ve felt truly forsaken well i m willing to suggest that if i can show at the sametime that i feel consoled but have you she demanded really felt so he hesitated consoled forsaken no i haven t but if it s her idea if it was her idea inshort that was enough this enunciation of motive the nextmoment however sounded to him perhaps slightly thin so that hegave it another touch that is if it s my idea i happen yousee to like my idea well it s beautiful and wonderful but isn t it possibly charlotte asked not quite enough to marry me for why so my dear child isn t a man s idea usually what he doesmarry for charlotte considering looked as if this might perhaps be alarge question or at all events something of an extension of onethey were immediately concerned with doesn t that a good dealdepend on the sort of thing it may be she suggested that aboutmarriage ideas as he called them might differ with which however giving no more time to it she sounded another question don t you appear rather to put it to me that i may accept youroffer for maggie s sake somehow she turned it over i don tso clearly see her quite so much finding reassurance or evenquite so much needing it do you then make nothing at all of her having been so ready toleave us ah charlotte on the contrary made much she was ready to leaveus because she had to be from the moment the prince wanted itshe could only go with him perfectly so that if you see your way she will be able to gowith him in future as much as she likes charlotte appeared to examine for a minute in maggie s interest this privilege the result of which was a limited concession you ve certainly worked it out of course i ve worked it out that s exactly what i have done she hadn t for a long time been so happy about anything as atyour being there with me i was to be with you said charlotte for her security well adam verver rang out this is her security you veonly if you can t see it to ask her ask her the girl echoed it in wonder certainly in somany words telling her you don t believe me still she debated do you mean write it to her quite so immediately to morrow oh i don t think i can write it said charlotte stant when iwrite to her and she looked amused for so different a shade it s about the principino s appetite and dr brady s visits very good then put it to her face to face we ll go straight toparis to meet them charlotte at this rose with a movement that was like a smallcry but her unspoken sense lost itself while she stood with hereyes on him he keeping his seat as for the help it gave him alittle to make his appeal go up presently however a new sensehad come to her and she covered him kindly with the expressionof it i do think you know you must rather like me thank you said adam verver you will put it to her yourselfthen she had another hesitation we go over you say to meet them as soon as we can get back to fawns and wait there for them ifnecessary till they come wait a at fawns wait in paris that will be charming in itself you take me to pleasant places she turned it over youpropose to me beautiful things it rests but with you to make them beautiful and pleasant you ve made brighton ah she almost tenderly protested with what i m doing now you re promising me now what i want aren t you promising me he pressed getting up aren t you promising me to abide by whatmaggie says oh she wanted to be sure she was do you mean she ll ask it ofme it gave him indeed as by communication a sense of the proprietyof being himself certain yet what was he but certain she llspeak to you she ll speak to you for me this at last then seemed to satisfy her very good may we waitagain to talk of it till she has done so he showed with hishands down in his pockets and his shoulders expressively up acertain disappointment soon enough none the less hisgentleness was all back and his patience once more exemplary ofcourse i give you time especially he smiled as it s timethat i shall be spending with you our keeping on together willhelp you perhaps to see to see i mean how i need you i already see said charlotte how you ve persuaded yourselfyou do but she had to repeat it that isn t unfortunately all well then how you ll make maggie right right she echoed it as if the word went far and o oh she still critically murmured as they moved together away xiiihe had talked to her of their waiting in paris a week later buton the spot there this period of patience suffered no greatstrain he had written to his daughter not indeed from brighton but directly after their return to fawns where they spent onlyforty eight hours before resuming their journey and maggie sreply to his news was a telegram from rome delivered to him atnoon of their fourth day and which he brought out to charlotte who was seated at that moment in the court of the hotel wherethey had agreed that he should join her for their proceedingtogether to the noontide meal his letter at fawns a letter ofseveral pages and intended lucidly unreservedly in fact all buttriumphantly to inform had proved on his sitting down to it and a little to his surprise not quite so simple a document toframe as even his due consciousness of its weight of meaning hadallowed him to assume this doubtless however only for reasonsnaturally latent in the very wealth of that consciousness whichcontributed to his message something of their own quality ofimpatience the main result of their talk for the time had beena difference in his relation to his young friend as well as adifference equally sensible in her relation to himself andthis in spite of his not having again renewed his undertaking to speak to her so far even as to tell her of the communicationdespatched to rome delicacy a delicacy more beautiful still all the delicacy she should want reigned between them it beingrudimentary in their actual order that she mustn t be furtherworried until maggie should have put her at her ease it was just the delicacy however that in paris which suggestively was brighton at a hundredfold higher pitch made between him and his companion the tension made the suspense made what he would have consented perhaps to call the provisionalpeculiarity of present conditions these elements acted in amanner of their own imposing and involving under one head manyabstentions and precautions twenty anxieties and reminders things verily he would scarce have known how to express andyet creating for them at every step an acceptance of theirreality he was hanging back with charlotte till another personshould intervene for their assistance and yet they had by whathad already occurred been carried on to something it was out ofthe power of other persons to make either less or greater commonconventions that was what was odd had to be on this basis morethought of those common conventions that previous to thepassage by the brighton strand he had so enjoyed the sense oftheir overlooking the explanation would have been he supposed or would have figured it with less of unrest that paris had inits way deeper voices and warnings so that if you went at all far there it laid bristling traps as they might have beenviewed all smothered in flowers for your going further still there were strange appearances in the air and before you knew ityou might be unmistakably matching them since he wishedtherefore to match no appearance but that of a gentleman playingwith perfect fairness any game in life he might be called to hefound himself on the receipt of maggie s missive rejoicing witha certain inconsistency the announcement made her from home had in the act cost some biting of his pen to sundry parts of him his personal modesty his imagination of her prepared state forso quick a jump it didn t much matter which and yet he was moreeager than not for the drop of delay and for the quickertransitions promised by the arrival of the imminent pair therewas after all a hint of offence to a man of his age in beingtaken as they said at the shops on approval maggie certainly would have been as far as charlotte herself from positivelydesiring this and charlotte on her side as far as maggie fromholding him light as a real value she made him fidget thus poorgirl but from generous rigour of conscience these allowances of his spirit were all the same consistentwith a great gladness at the sight of the term of his ordeal forit was the end of his seeming to agree that questions and doubtshad a place the more he had inwardly turned the matter over themore it had struck him that they had in truth only an ugliness what he could have best borne as he now believed would havebeen charlotte s simply saying to him that she didn t like himenough this he wouldn t have enjoyed but he would quite haveunderstood it and been able ruefully to submit she did like himenough nothing to contradict that had come out for him so thathe was restless for her as well as for himself she looked at himhard a moment when he handed her his telegram and the look forwhat he fancied a dim shy fear in it gave him perhaps his bestmoment of conviction that as a man so to speak he properlypleased her he said nothing the words sufficiently did it forhim doing it again better still as charlotte who had left herchair at his approach murmured them out we start to night tobring you all our love and joy and sympathy there they were the words and what did she want more she didn t however asshe gave him back the little unfolded leaf say they were enough though he saw the next moment that her silence was probablynot disconnected from her having just visibly turned pale herextraordinarily fine eyes as it was his present theory that hehad always thought them shone at him the more darkly out of thischange of colour and she had again with it her apparent way ofsubjecting herself for explicit honesty and through herwillingness to face him to any view he might take all at hisease and even to wantonness of the condition he produced inher as soon as he perceived that emotion kept her soundless heknew himself deeply touched since it proved that little as sheprofessed she had been beautifully hoping they stood there aminute while he took in from this sign that yes then certainlyshe liked him enough liked him enough to make him old as he wasready to brand himself flush for the pleasure of it thepleasure of it accordingly made him speak first do you begin alittle to be satisfied still however she had to think we ve hurried them you see why so breathless a start because they want to congratulate us they want said adamverver to see our happiness she wondered again and this time also for him as publicly aspossible so much as that do you think it s too much she continued to think plainly they weren t to have started foranother week well what then isn t our situation worth the little sacrifice we ll go back to rome as soon as you like with them this seemed to hold her as he had previously seen her held justa trifle inscrutably by his allusions to what they would dotogether on a certain contingency worth it the littlesacrifice for whom for us naturally yes she said we wantto see them for our reasons that is she rather dimly smiled you do and you do my dear too he bravely declared yes then i dotoo she after an instant ungrudging enough acknowledged forus however something depends on it rather but does nothing depend on it for them what can from the moment that as appears they don t want tonip us in the bud i can imagine their rushing up to prevent us but an enthusiasm for us that can wait so very little suchintense eagerness i confess she went on more than a littlepuzzles me you may think me she also added ungracious andsuspicious but the prince can t at all want to come back sosoon he wanted quite too intensely to get away mr verver considered well hasn t he been away yes just long enough to see how he likes it besides saidcharlotte he may not be able to join in the rosy view of ourcase that you impute to her it can t in the least have appearedto him hitherto a matter of course that you should give his wifea bouncing stepmother adam verver at this looked grave i m afraid then he ll justhave to accept from us whatever his wife accepts and accept it if he can imagine no better reason just because she does that he declared will have to do for him his tone made her for a moment meet his face after which letme she abruptly said see it again taking from him thefolded leaf that she had given back and he had kept in his hand isn t the whole thing she asked when she had read it over perhaps but a way like another for their gaining time he again stood staring but the next minute with that upwardspring of his shoulders and that downward pressure of his pocketswhich she had already more than once at disconcerted moments determined in him he turned sharply away and wandered from herin silence he looked about in his small despair he crossed thehotel court which overarched and glazed muffled against loudsounds and guarded against crude sights heated gilded draped almost carpeted with exotic trees in tubs exotic ladies inchairs the general exotic accent and presence suspended as withwings folded or feebly fluttering in the superior the supreme the inexorably enveloping parisian medium resembled somecritical apartment of large capacity some dental medical surgical waiting room a scene of mixed anxiety and desire preparatory for gathered barbarians to the due amputation orextraction of excrescences and redundancies of barbarism he wentas far as the porte cochere took counsel afresh of his usualoptimism sharpened even somehow just here by the very air hetasted and then came back smiling to charlotte it isincredible to you that when a man is still as much in love asamerigo his most natural impulse should be to feel what his wifefeels to believe what she believes to want what she wants inthe absence that is of special impediments to his so doing the manner of it operated she acknowledged with no great delaythis natural possibility no nothing is incredible to me ofpeople immensely in love well isn t amerigo immensely in love she hesitated but as for the right expression of her sense of thedegree but she after all adopted mr verver s immensely then there you are she had another smile however she wasn t there quite yet thatisn t all that s wanted but what more why that his wife shall have made him really believe that shereally believes with which charlotte became still more lucidlylogical the reality of his belief will depend in such a case onthe reality of hers the prince may for instance now she wenton have made out to his satisfaction that maggie may mainlydesire to abound in your sense whatever it is you do he mayremember that he has never seen her do anything else well said adam verver what kind of a warning will he havefound in that to what catastrophe will he have observed such adisposition in her to lead just to this one with which she struck him as risingstraighter and clearer before him than she had done even yet our little question itself her appearance had in fact at themoment such an effect on him that he could answer but inmarvelling mildness hadn t we better wait a while till we callit a catastrophe her rejoinder to this was to wait though by no means as long ashe meant when at the end of her minute she spoke however itwas mildly too what would you like dear friend to wait for it lingered between them in the air this demand and theyexchanged for the time a look which might have made each of themseem to have been watching in the other the signs of its overtirony these were indeed immediately so visible in mr verver sface that as if a little ashamed of having so markedly producedthem and as if also to bring out at last under pressure something she had all the while been keeping back she took ajump to pure plain reason you haven t noticed for yourself buti can t quite help noticing that in spite of what you assume weassume if you like maggie wires her joy only to you she makesno sign of its overflow to me it was a point and staring a moment he took account of it buthe had as before his presence of mind to say nothing of hiskindly humour why you complain of the very thing that s mostcharmingly conclusive she treats us already as one clearly now for the girl in spite of lucidity and logic therewas something in the way he said things she faced him in allher desire to please him and then her word quite simply anddefinitely showed it i do like you you know well what could this do but stimulate his humour i see what sthe matter with you you won t be quiet till you ve heard fromthe prince himself i think the happy man added that i ll goand secretly wire to him that you d like reply paid a few wordsfor yourself it could apparently but encourage her further to smile replypaid for him you mean or for me oh i ll pay with pleasure anything back for you as manywords as you like and he went on to keep it up not requiringeither to see your message she could take it visibly as he meant it should you requireto see the prince s not a bit you can keep that also to yourself on his speaking however as if his transmitting the hint were areal question she appeared to consider and almost as if forgood taste that the joke had gone far enough it doesn tmatter unless he speaks of his own movement and why should itbe she asked a thing that would occur to him i really think mr verver concurred that it naturallywouldn t he doesn t know you re morbid she just wondered but she agreed no he hasn t yet found itout perhaps he will but he hasn t yet and i m willing to givehim meanwhile the benefit of the doubt so with this thesituation to her view would appear to have cleared had she nottoo quickly had one of her restless relapses maggie however does know i m morbid she hasn t the benefit well said adam verver a little wearily at last i think ifeel that you ll hear from her yet it had even fairly come overhim under recurrent suggestion that his daughter s omission wassurprising and maggie had never in her life been wrong for morethan three minutes oh it isn t that i hold that i ve a right to it charlotte thenext instant rather oddly qualified and the observation itselfgave him a further push very well i shall like it myself at this then as if moved by his way of constantly and more orless against his own contention coming round to her she showedhow she could also always and not less gently come half way ispeak of it only as the missing grace the grace that s ineverything that maggie does it isn t my due she kept it up but taking from you that we may still expect it it will havethe touch it will be beautiful then come out to breakfast mr verver had looked at hiswatch it will be here when we get back if it isn t and charlotte smiled as she looked about for afeather boa that she had laid down on descending from her room if it isn t it will have had but that slight fault he saw her boa on the arm of the chair from which she had movedto meet him and after he had fetched it raising it to make itscharming softness brush his face for it was a wondrous productof paris purchased under his direct auspices the day before heheld it there a minute before giving it up will you promise methen to be at peace she looked while she debated at his admirable present ipromise you quite for ever quite for ever remember he went on to justify his demand remember that inwiring you she ll naturally speak even more for her husband thanshe has done in wiring me it was only at a word that charlotte had a demur naturally why our marriage puts him for you you see or puts you forhim into a new relation whereas it leaves his relation to meunchanged it therefore gives him more to say to you about it about its making me his stepmother in law or whatever i shouldbecome over which for a little she not undivertedly mused yes there may easily be enough for a gentleman to say to ayoung woman about that well amerigo can always be according to the case either asfunny or as serious as you like and whichever he may be for you in sending you a message he ll be it all and then as the girl with one of her so deeply and oddly yet so tenderly criticallooks at him failed to take up the remark he found himselfmoved as by a vague anxiety to add a question don t you thinkhe s charming oh charming said charlotte stant if he weren t i shouldn tmind no more should i her friend harmoniously returned ah but you don t mind you don t have to you don t have to imean as i have it s the last folly ever to care in an anxiousway the least particle more than one is absolutely forced if iwere you she went on if i had in my life for happiness andpower and peace even a small fraction of what you have it wouldtake a great deal to make me waste my worry i don t know shesaid what in the world that didn t touch my luck i shouldtrouble my head about i quite understand you yet doesn t it just depend mr ververasked on what you call one s luck it s exactly my luck thati m talking about i shall be as sublime as you like when you vemade me all right it s only when one is right that one reallyhas the things you speak of it isn t they he explained thatmake one so it s the something else i want that makes themright if you ll give me what i ask you ll see she had taken her boa and thrown it over her shoulders and hereyes while she still delayed had turned from him engaged byanother interest though the court was by this time the hour ofdispersal for luncheon so forsaken that they would have had it for free talk should they have been moved to loudness quite tothemselves she was ready for their adjournment but she was alsoaware of a pedestrian youth in uniform a visible emissary ofthe postes et telegraphes who had approached from the street the small stronghold of the concierge and who presented there amissive taken from the little cartridge box slung over hisshoulder the portress meeting him on the threshold metequally across the court charlotte s marked attention to hisvisit so that within the minute she had advanced to ourfriends with her cap streamers flying and her smile ofannouncement as ample as her broad white apron she raised alofta telegraphic message and as she delivered it sociablydiscriminated cette fois ci pour madame with which she asgenially retreated leaving charlotte in possession charlotte taking it held it at first unopened her eyes had come back toher companion who had immediately and triumphantly greeted it ah there you are she broke the envelope then in silence and for a minute as withthe message he himself had put before her studied its contentswithout a sign he watched her without a question and at lastshe looked up i ll give you she simply said what you ask the expression of her face was strange but since when had awoman s at moments of supreme surrender not a right to be hetook it in with his own long look and his grateful silence sothat nothing more for some instants passed between them theirunderstanding sealed itself he already felt that she had madehim right but he was in presence too of the fact that maggie hadmade her so and always therefore without maggie where infine would he be she united them brought them together as withthe click of a silver spring and on the spot with the visionof it his eyes filled charlotte facing him meanwhile with herexpression made still stranger by the blur of his gratitude through it all however he smiled what my child does forme through it all as well that is still through the blur he sawcharlotte rather than heard her reply she held her paper wideopen but her eyes were all for his it isn t maggie it s theprince i say he gaily rang out then it s best of all it s enough thank you for thinking so to which he added it s enough forour question but it isn t is it quite enough for ourbreakfast dejeunons she stood there however in spite of this appeal her documentalways before them don t you want to read it he thought not if it satisfies you i don t require it but she gave him as for her conscience another chance you canif you like he hesitated afresh but as for amiability not for curiosity is it funny thus finally she again dropped her eyes on it drawing in herlips a little no i call it grave ah then i don t want it very grave said charlotte stant well what did i tell you of him he asked rejoicing as theystarted a question for all answer to which before she took hisarm the girl thrust her paper crumpled into the pocket of hercoat part thirdxivcharlotte half way up the monumental staircase had begun bywaiting alone waiting to be rejoined by her companion who hadgone down all the way as in common kindness bound and who hisduty performed would know where to find her she was meanwhile though extremely apparent not perhaps absolutely advertised butshe would not have cared if she had been so little was it bythis time her first occasion of facing society with aconsciousness materially with a confidence quite splendidly enriched for a couple of years now she had known as never beforewhat it was to look well to look that is as well as she hadalways felt from far back that in certain conditions shemight on such an evening as this that of a great official partyin the full flush of the london spring time the conditionsaffected her her nerves her senses her imagination as allprofusely present so that perhaps at no moment yet had she beenso justified of her faith as at the particular instant of ourbeing again concerned with her that of her chancing to glancehigher up from where she stood and meeting in consequence thequiet eyes of colonel assingham who had his elbows on the broadbalustrade of the great gallery overhanging the staircase and whoimmediately exchanged with her one of his most artlessly familiarsignals this simplicity of his visual attention struck her evenwith the other things she had to think about as the quietestnote in the whole high pitch much in fact as if she hadpressed a finger on a chord or a key and created for the numberof seconds an arrest of vibration a more muffled thump thesight of him suggested indeed that fanny would be there thoughso far as opportunity went she had not seen her this was aboutthe limit of what it could suggest the air however had suggestions enough it abounded in them many of them precisely helping to constitute those conditionswith which for our young woman the hour was brilliantlycrowned she was herself in truth crowned and it all hungtogether melted together in light and colour and sound theunsurpassed diamonds that her head so happily carried the otherjewels the other perfections of aspect and arrangement that madeher personal scheme a success the proved private theory thatmaterials to work with had been all she required and that therewere none too precious for her to understand and use to whichmight be added lastly as the strong scented flower of the totalsweetness an easy command a high enjoyment of her crisis fora crisis she was ready to take it and this ease it was doubtless that helped her while she waited to the rightassurance to the right indifference to the right expression and above all as she felt to the right view of her opportunityfor happiness unless indeed the opportunity itself rather were in its mere strange amplitude the producing theprecipitating cause the ordered revellers rustling and shining with sweep of train and glitter of star and clink of sword andyet for all this but so imperfectly articulate so vaguelyvocal the double stream of the coming and the going flowingtogether where she stood passed her brushed her treated her tomuch crude contemplation and now and then to a spasm of speech an offered hand even in some cases to an unencouraged pause butshe missed no countenance and invited no protection she fairlyliked to be so long as she might just as she was exposed alittle to the public no doubt in her unaccompanied state but even if it were a bit brazen careless of queer reflections onthe dull polish of london faces and exposed since it was aquestion of exposure to much more competent recognitions of herown she hoped no one would stop she was positively keepingherself it was her idea to mark in a particular manner theimportance of something that had just happened she knew how sheshould mark it and what she was doing there made already abeginning when presently therefore from her standpoint she saw theprince come back she had an impression of all the place as higherand wider and more appointed for great moments with its dome oflustres lifted its ascents and descents more majestic itsmarble tiers more vividly overhung its numerosity of royalties foreign and domestic more unprecedented its symbolism of state hospitality both emphasised and refined this wasdoubtless a large consequence of a fairly familiar cause aconsiderable inward stir to spring from the mere vision strikingas that might be of amerigo in a crowd but she had her reasons she held them there she carried them in fact responsibly andovertly as she carried her head her high tiara her folded fan her indifferent unattended eminence and it was when he reachedher and she could taking his arm show herself as placed in herrelation that she felt supremely justified it was her notion ofcourse that she gave a glimpse of but few of her grounds for thisdiscrimination indeed of the most evident alone yet she wouldhave been half willing it should be guessed how she drewinspiration drew support in quantity sufficient for almostanything from the individual value that through all thepicture her husband s son in law kept for the eye deriving itfrom his fine unconscious way in the swarming social sum ofoutshining overlooking and overtopping it was as if inseparation even the shortest she half forgot or disbelieved howhe affected her sight so that reappearance had in him eachtime a virtue of its own a kind of disproportionate intensitysuggesting his connection with occult sources of renewal whatdid he do when he was away from her that made him always comeback only looking as she would have called it more so superior to any shade of cabotinage he yet almostresembled an actor who between his moments on the stage revisits his dressing room and before the glass pressed by hisneed of effect retouches his make up the prince was at present for instance though he had quitted her but ten minutes before still more than then the person it pleased her to be left with atruth that had all its force for her while he made her his carefor their conspicuous return together to the upper rooms conspicuous beyond any wish they could entertain was what poorwonderful man he couldn t help making it and when she raisedher eyes again on the ascent to bob assingham still aloft inhis gallery and still looking down at her she was aware that inspite of hovering and warning inward voices she even enjoyed thetestimony rendered by his lonely vigil to the lustre shereflected he was always lonely at great parties the dear colonel itwasn t in such places that the seed he sowed at home was everreaped by him but nobody could have seemed to mind it less tobrave it with more bronzed indifference so markedly that hemoved about less like one of the guests than like some quitepresentable person in charge of the police arrangements or theelectric light to mrs verver as will be seen he represented with the perfect good faith of his apparent blankness somethingdefinite enough though her bravery was not thereby too blightedfor her to feel herself calling him to witness that the onlywitchcraft her companion had used within the few minutes wasthat of attending maggie who had withdrawn from the scene toher carriage notified at all events of fanny s probablepresence charlotte was for a while after this divided betweenthe sense of it as a fact somehow to reckon with and deal with which was a perception that made in its degree for theprudence the pusillanimity of postponement of avoidance and aquite other feeling an impatience that presently ended byprevailing an eagerness really to be suspected sounded veritably arraigned if only that she might have the bad momentover if only that she might prove to herself let alone tomrs assingham also that she could convert it to good if only in short to be square as they said with her question forherself indeed particularly it wasn t a question but somethingin her bones told her that fanny would treat it as one and therewas truly nothing that from this friend she was not bound indecency to take she might hand things back with every tenderprecaution with acknowledgments and assurances but she owed itto them in any case and it to all mrs assingham had done forher not to get rid of them without having well unwrapped andturned them over to night as happened and she recognised it more and more withthe ebbing minutes as an influence of everything about her to night exactly she would no doubt since she knew why be asfirm as she might at any near moment again hope to be for goingthrough that process with the right temper and tone she said after a little to the prince stay with me let no one takeyou for i want her yes i do want her to see us together andthe sooner the better said it to keep her hand on him throughconstant diversions and made him in fact by saying it professa momentary vagueness she had to explain to him that it wasfanny assingham she wanted to see who clearly would be there since the colonel never either stirred without her or oncearrived concerned himself for her fate and she had further after amerigo had met her with see us together why in theworld hasn t she often seen us together to inform him thatwhat had elsewhere and otherwise happened didn t now matter andthat she at any rate well knew for the occasion what she wasabout you re strange cara mia he consentingly enoughdropped but for whatever strangeness he kept her as theycirculated from being waylaid even remarking to her afresh ashe had often done before on the help rendered in suchsituations by the intrinsic oddity of the london squash athing of vague slow senseless eddies revolving as in fear ofsome menace of conversation suspended over it the drop of which with some consequent refreshing splash or spatter yet never tookplace of course she was strange this as they went charlotteknew for herself how could she be anything else when thesituation holding her and holding him for that matter just asmuch had so the stamp of it she had already accepted herconsciousness as we have already noted that a crisis for themall was in the air and when such hours were not depressing which was the form indeed in which she had mainly known them they were apparently in a high degree exhilarating later on in a corner to which at sight of an empty sofa mrs assingham had after a single attentive arrest led her with acertain earnestness this vision of the critical was much moresharpened than blurred fanny had taken it from her yes she wasthere with amerigo alone maggie having come with them and then within ten minutes changed her mind repented and departed soyou re staying on together without her the elder woman hadasked and it was charlotte s answer to this that had determinedfor them quite indeed according to the latter s expectation theneed of some seclusion and her companion s pounce at the sofa they were staying on together alone and oh distinctly it wasalone that maggie had driven away her father as usual nothaving managed to come as usual mrs assingham had seemedto wonder mr verver s reluctances not having she in fact quiteintimated hitherto struck her charlotte responded at any rate that his indisposition to go out had lately much increased eventhough to night as she admitted he had pleaded his not feelingwell maggie had wished to stay with him for the prince and she dining out had afterwards called in portland place whence inthe event they had brought her charlotte on maggie had comebut to oblige her father she had urged the two others to gowithout her then she had yielded for the time to mr verver spersuasion but here when they had after the long wait in thecarriage fairly got in here once up the stairs with the roomsbefore them remorse had ended by seizing her she had listenedto no other remonstrance and at present therefore as charlotteput it the two were doubtless making together a little party athome but it was all right so charlotte also put it there wasnothing in the world they liked better than these snatchedfelicities little parties long talks with i ll come to youto morrow and no i ll come to you make believe renewals oftheir old life they were fairly at times the dear things likechildren playing at paying visits playing at mr thompson and mrs fane each hoping that the other would really stay to tea charlotte was sure she should find maggie there on getting home a remark in which mrs verver s immediate response to herfriend s inquiry had culminated she had thus on the spot thesense of having given her plenty to think about and thatmoreover of liking to see it even better than she had expected she had plenty to think about herself and there was alreadysomething in fanny that made it seem still more you say your husband s ill he felt too ill to come no my dear i think not if he had been too ill i wouldn t haveleft him and yet maggie was worried mrs assingham asked she worries you know easily she s afraid of influenza ofwhich he has had at different times though never with the leastgravity several attacks but you re not afraid of it charlotte had for a moment a pause it had continued to come toher that really to have her case out as they said with theperson in the world to whom her most intimate difficulties hadoftenest referred themselves would help her on the whole morethan hinder and under that feeling all her opportunity withnothing kept back with a thing or two perhaps even thrustforward seemed temptingly to open besides didn t fanny atbottom half expect absolutely at the bottom half want things so that she would be disappointed if after what must just haveoccurred for her she didn t get something to put between theteeth of her so restless rumination that cultivation of thefear of which our young woman had already had glimpses that shemight have gone too far in her irrepressible interest in otherlives what had just happened it pieced itself together forcharlotte was that the assingham pair drifting like everyoneelse had had somewhere in the gallery in the rooms anaccidental concussion had it after the colonel over hisbalustrade had observed in the favouring high light her publicjunction with the prince his very dryness in this encounter had as always struck a spark from his wife s curiosity and familiar on his side with all that she saw in things he hadthrown her as a fine little bone to pick some report of the wayone of her young friends was going on with another he knewperfectly such at least was charlotte s liberal assumption thatshe wasn t going on with anyone but she also knew that giventhe circumstances she was inevitably to be sacrificed in someform or another to the humorous intercourse of the inimitablecouple the prince meanwhile had also under coercion sacrificedher the ambassador had come up to him with a message fromroyalty to whom he was led away after which she had talked forfive minutes with sir john brinder who had been of theambassador s company and who had rather artlessly remained withher fanny had then arrived in sight of them at the same momentas someone else she didn t know someone who knew mrs assinghamand also knew sir john charlotte had left it to her friend scompetence to throw the two others immediately together and tofind a way for entertaining her in closer quarters this was thelittle history of the vision in her that was now rapidlyhelping her to recognise a precious chance the chance thatmightn t again soon be so good for the vivid making of a point her point was before her it was sharp bright true above allit was her own she had reached it quite by herself no one noteven amerigo amerigo least of all who would have nothing to dowith it had given her aid to make it now with force for fannyassingham s benefit would see her further in the direction inwhich the light had dawned than any other spring she should yetawhile doubtless be able to press the direction was that ofher greater freedom which was all in the world she had in mind her opportunity had accordingly after a few minutes of mrs assingham s almost imprudently interested expression of face positively acquired such a price for her that she may forourselves while the intensity lasted rather resemble a personholding out a small mirror at arm s length and consulting itwith a special turn of the head it was in a word with thisvalue of her chance that she was intelligently playing when shesaid in answer to fanny s last question don t you remember whatyou told me on the occasion of something or other the otherday that you believe there s nothing i m afraid of so my dear don t ask me mayn t i ask you mrs assingham returned how the case standswith your poor husband certainly dear only when you ask me as if i mightn t perhapsknow what to think it seems to me best to let you see that iknow perfectly what to think mrs assingham hesitated then blinking a little she took herrisk you didn t think that if it was a question of anyone sreturning to him in his trouble it would be better you yourselfshould have gone well charlotte s answer to this inquiry visibly shaped itself inthe interest of the highest considerations the highestconsiderations were good humour candour clearness and obviously the real truth if we couldn t be perfectly frank anddear with each other it would be ever so much better wouldn tit that we shouldn t talk about anything at all which however would be dreadful and we certainly at any rate haven t yetcome to it you can ask me anything under the sun you like because don t you see you can t upset me i m sure my dear charlotte fanny assingham laughed i don twant to upset you indeed love you simply couldn t even if you thought itnecessary that s all i mean nobody could for it belongs to mysituation that i m by no merit of my own just fixed fixed asfast as a pin stuck up to its head in a cushion i m placed ican t imagine anyone more placed there i am fanny had indeed never listened to emphasis more firmly applied and it brought into her own eyes though she had reasons forstriving to keep them from betrayals a sort of anxiety ofintelligence i dare say but your statement of your position however you see it isn t an answer to my inquiry it seems tome at the same time i confess mrs assingham added to givebut the more reason for it you speak of our being frank howcan we possibly be anything else if maggie has gone off throughfinding herself too distressed to stay and if she s willing toleave you and her husband to show here without her aren t thegrounds of her preoccupation more or less discussable if they re not charlotte replied it s only from their being in a way too evident they re not grounds for me they weren twhen i accepted adam s preference that i should come to nightwithout him just as i accept absolutely as a fixed rule allhis preferences but that doesn t alter the fact of course thatmy husband s daughter rather than his wife should have felt shecould after all be the one to stay with him the one to makethe sacrifice of this hour seeing especially that the daughterhas a husband of her own in the field with which she produced as it were her explanation i ve simply to see the truth of thematter see that maggie thinks more on the whole of fathersthan of husbands and my situation is such she went on thatthis becomes immediately don t you understand a thing i have tocount with mrs assingham vaguely heaving panting a little but trying notto show it turned about from some inward spring in her seat if you mean such a thing as that she doesn t adore theprince i don t say she doesn t adore him what i say is that shedoesn t think of him one of those conditions doesn t always atall stages involve the other this is just how she adores him charlotte said and what reason is there in the world afterall why he and i shouldn t as you say show together we veshown together my dear she smiled before her friend for a little only looked at her speaking then withabruptness you ought to be absolutely happy you live with suchgood people the effect of it as well was an arrest for charlotte whoseface however all of whose fine and slightly hard radiance ithad caused the next instant further to brighten does one everput into words anything so fatuously rash it s a thing that mustbe said in prudence for one by somebody who s so good as totake the responsibility the more that it gives one always achance to show one s best manners by not contradicting it certainly you ll never have the distress or whatever ofhearing me complain truly my dear i hope in all conscience not and the elderwoman s spirit found relief in a laugh more resonant than wasquite advised by their pursuit of privacy to this demonstration her friend gave no heed with all ourabsence after marriage and with the separation from her producedin particular by our so many months in america maggie has stillarrears still losses to make up still the need of showing how for so long she simply kept missing him she missed hiscompany a large allowance of which is in spite of everythingelse of the first necessity to her so she puts it in when shecan a little here a little there and it ends by making up aconsiderable amount the fact of our distinct establishments which has all the same everything in its favour charlottehastened to declare makes her really see more of him than whenthey had the same house to make sure she doesn t fail of itshe s always arranging for it which she didn t have to do whilethey lived together but she likes to arrange charlottesteadily proceeded it peculiarly suits her and the result ofour separate households is really for them more contact andmore intimacy to night for instance has been practically anarrangement she likes him best alone and it s the way saidour young woman in which he best likes her it s what i meantherefore by being placed and the great thing is as they say to know one s place doesn t it all strike you she wound up as rather placing the prince too fanny assingham had at this moment the sense as of a large heapeddish presented to her intelligence and inviting it to a feast sothick were the notes of intention in this remarkable speech butshe also felt that to plunge at random to help herself toofreely would apart from there not being at such a moment timefor it tend to jostle the ministering hand confound the arrayand more vulgarly speaking make a mess so she picked out after consideration a solitary plum so placed that you have toarrange certainly i have to arrange and the prince also if the effect for him is the same really i think not less and does he arrange mrs assingham asked to make up hisarrears the question had risen to her lips it was as ifanother morsel on the dish had tempted her the sound of itstruck her own ear immediately as giving out more of herthought than she had as yet intended but she quickly saw thatshe must follow it up at any risk with simplicity and thatwhat was simplest was the ease of boldness make them up imean by coming to see you charlotte replied however without as her friend would havephrased it turning a hair she shook her head but it wasbeautifully gentle he never comes oh said fanny assingham with which she felt a little stupid there it is he might so well you know otherwise otherwise and fanny was still vague it passed this time over her companion whose eyes wandering to a distance found themselves held the prince was at handagain the ambassador was still at his side they were stopped amoment by a uniformed personage a little old man of apparentlythe highest military character bristling with medals and orders this gave charlotte time to go on he has not been for threemonths and then as with her friend s last word in her ear otherwise yes he arranges otherwise and in my position she added i might too it s too absurd we shouldn t meet you ve met i gather said fanny assingham to night yes as far as that goes but what i mean is that i might placed for it as we both are go to see him and do you fanny asked with almost mistaken solemnity the perception of this excess made charlotte whether for gravityor for irony hang fire a minute i have been but that snothing she said in itself and i tell you of it only to showyou how our situation works it essentially becomes one asituation for both of us the prince s however is his ownaffair i meant but to speak of mine your situation s perfect mrs assingham presently declared i don t say it isn t taken in fact all round i think it is and i don t as i tell you complain of it the only thing isthat i have to act as it demands of me to act said mrs assingham with an irrepressible quaver isn t it acting my dear to accept it i do accept it what doyou want me to do less i want you to believe that you re a very fortunate person do you call that less charlotte asked with a smile from thepoint of view of my freedom i call it more let it take myposition any name you like don t let it at any rate and mrs assingham s impatienceprevailed at last over her presence of mind don t let it makeyou think too much of your freedom i don t know what you call too much for how can i not see it asit is you d see your own quickly enough if the colonel gave youthe same liberty and i haven t to tell you with your so muchgreater knowledge of everything what it is that gives suchliberty most for yourself personally of course charlotte wenton you only know the state of neither needing it nor missingit your husband doesn t treat you as of less importance to himthan some other woman ah don t talk to me of other women fanny now overtly panted do you call mr verver s perfectly natural interest in hisdaughter the greatest affection of which he is capable charlotte tookit up in all readiness i do distinctly and in spite of myhaving done all i could think of to make him capable of agreater i ve done earnestly everything i could i ve made it month after month my study but i haven t succeeded it has beenvividly brought home to me to night however she pursued i vehoped against hope for i recognise that as i told you at thetime i was duly warned and then as she met in her friend sface the absence of any such remembrance he did tell me that hewanted me just because i could be useful about her with whichcharlotte broke into a wonderful smile so you see i am it was on fanny assingham s lips for the moment to reply thatthis was on the contrary exactly what she didn t see she camein fact within an ace of saying you strike me as having quitefailed to help his idea to work since by your account maggiehas him not less but so much more on her mind how in theworld with so much of a remedy comes there to remain so much ofwhat was to be obviated but she saved herself in time conscious above all that she was in presence of still deeperthings than she had yet dared to fear that there was more init than any admission she had made represented and she had heldherself familiar with admissions so that not to seem tounderstand where she couldn t accept and not to seem to acceptwhere she couldn t approve and could still less withprecipitation advise she invoked the mere appearance of castingno weight whatever into the scales of her young friend sconsistency the only thing was that as she was quickly enoughto feel she invoked it rather to excess it brought her her invocation too abruptly to her feet she brushed awayeverything i can t conceive my dear what you re talkingabout charlotte promptly rose then as might be to meet it and hercolour for the first time perceptibly heightened she looked for the minute as her companion had looked as if twentyprotests blocking each other s way had surged up within her but when charlotte had to make a selection her selection wasalways the most effective possible it was happy now above all for being made not in anger but in sorrow you give me up then give you up you forsake me at the hour of my life when it seems to me i mostdeserve a friend s loyalty if you do you re not just fanny you re even i think she went on rather cruel and it s leastof all worthy of you to seem to wish to quarrel with me in orderto cover your desertion she spoke at the same time with thenoblest moderation of tone and the image of high pale lighteddisappointment she meanwhile presented as of a creature patientand lonely in her splendour was an impression so firmly imposedthat she could fill her measure to the brim and yet enjoy thelast word as it is called in such cases with a perfection voidof any vulgarity of triumph she merely completed for truth ssake her demonstration what is a quarrel with me but a quarrelwith my right to recognise the conditions of my bargain buti can carry them out alone she said as she turned away sheturned to meet the ambassador and the prince who their colloquywith their field marshal ended were now at hand and had already between them she was aware addressed her a remark that failedto penetrate the golden glow in which her intelligence wastemporarily bathed she had made her point the point she hadforeseen she must make she had made it thoroughly and once forall so that no more making was required and her success wasreflected in the faces of the two men of distinction before her unmistakably moved to admiration by her exceptional radiance sheat first but watched this reflection taking no note of any lessadequate form of it possibly presented by poor fanny poor fannyleft to stare at her incurred score chalked up in so fewstrokes on the wall then she took in what the ambassador wassaying in french what he was apparently repeating to her a desire for your presence madame has been expressed entres haut lieu and i ve let myself in for the responsibility tosay nothing of the honour of seeing as the most respectful ofyour friends that so august an impatience is not kept waiting the greatest possible personage had in short according to theodd formula of societies subject to the greatest personagespossible sent for her and she asked in her surprise whatin the world does he want to do to me only to know withoutlooking that fanny s bewilderment was called to a still largerapplication and to hear the prince say with authority indeedwith a certain prompt dryness you must go immediately it s asummons the ambassador using authority as well had alreadysomehow possessed himself of her hand which he drew into hisarm and she was further conscious as she went off with him that though still speaking for her benefit amerigo had turned tofanny assingham he would explain afterwards besides which shewould understand for herself to fanny however he had laughed as a mark apparently that for this infallible friend noexplanation at all would be necessary xvit may be recorded none the less that the prince was the nextmoment to see how little any such assumption was founded alonewith him now mrs assingham was incorruptible they send forcharlotte through you no my dear as you see through the ambassador ah but the ambassador and you for the last quarter of an hour have been for them as one he s your ambassador it may indeedbe further mentioned that the more fanny looked at it the moreshe saw in it they ve connected her with you she s treated asyour appendage oh my appendage the prince amusedly exclaimed cara mia what a name she s treated rather say as my ornament and myglory and it s so remarkable a case for a mother in law that yousurely can t find fault with it you ve ornaments enough it seems to me as you ve certainlyglories enough without her and she s not the least little bit mrs assingham observed your mother in law in such a matter ashade of difference is enormous she s no relation to youwhatever and if she s known in high quarters but as going aboutwith you then then she failed however as from positiveintensity of vision then then what he asked with perfectgood nature she had better in such a case not be known at all but i assure you i never just now so much as mentioned her doyou suppose i asked them said the young man still amused ifthey didn t want to see her you surely don t need to be shownthat charlotte speaks for herself that she does so above all onsuch an occasion as this and looking as she does to night how so looking can she pass unnoticed how can she not have success besides he added as she but watched his face letting him say what he would as if she wanted to see how hewould say it besides there is always the fact that we re ofthe same connection of what is your word the same concern we re certainly not with the relation of our respective sposi simply formal acquaintances we re in the same boat and theprince smiled with a candour that added an accent to hisemphasis fanny assingham was full of the special sense of his manner itcaused her to turn for a moment s refuge to a corner of hergeneral consciousness in which she could say to herself that shewas glad she wasn t in love with such a man as with charlottejust before she was embarrassed by the difference between whatshe took in and what she could say what she felt and what shecould show it only appears to me of great importance that nowthat you all seem more settled here charlotte should be known for any presentation any further circulation or introduction as in particular her husband s wife known in the leastpossible degree as anything else i don t know what you mean bythe same boat charlotte is naturally in mr verver s boat and pray am i not in mr verver s boat too why but for mr verver s boat i should have been by this time and his quickitalian gesture an expressive direction and motion of hisforefinger pointed to deepest depths away down down down she knew of course what he meant how it had taken hisfather in law s great fortune and taken no small slice tosurround him with an element in which all too fatally weightedas he had originally been he could pecuniarily float and withthis reminder other things came to her how strange it was that with all allowance for their merit it should befall some peopleto be so inordinately valued quoted as they said in thestock market so high and how still stranger perhaps thatthere should be cases in which for some reason one didn t mindthe so frequently marked absence in them of the purpose really torepresent their price she was thinking feeling at any rate for herself she was thinking that the pleasure she could take inthis specimen of the class didn t suffer from his consent to bemerely made buoyant partly because it was one of those pleasures he inspired them that by their nature couldn t suffer towhatever proof they were put and partly because besides heafter all visibly had on his conscience some sort of return forservices rendered he was a huge expense assuredly but it hadbeen up to now her conviction that his idea was to behavebeautifully enough to make the beauty well nigh an equivalent and that he had carried out his idea carried it out bycontinuing to lead the life to breathe the air very nearly tothink the thoughts that best suited his wife and her father this she had till lately enjoyed the comfort of so distinctlyperceiving as to have even been moved more than once to expressto him the happiness it gave her he had that in his favour asagainst other matters yet it discouraged her too and ratheroddly that he should so keep moving and be able to show herthat he moved on the firm ground of the truth hisacknowledgment of obligation was far from unimportant but shecould find in his grasp of the real itself a kind of ominousintimation the intimation appeared to peep at her even out ofhis next word lightly as he produced it isn t it rather as if we had charlotte and i for bringing ustogether a benefactor in common and the effect for hisinterlocutress was still further to be deepened i somehowfeel half the time as if he were her father in law too it s asif he had saved us both which is a fact in our lives or at anyrate in our hearts to make of itself a link don t youremember he kept it up how the day she suddenly turned upfor you just before my wedding we so frankly and funnilytalked in her presence of the advisability for her of somegood marriage and then as his friend s face in her extremity quite again as with charlotte but continued to fly the blackflag of general repudiation well we really began then as itseems to me the work of placing her where she is we were whollyright and so was she that it was exactly the thing is shown byits success we recommended a good marriage at almost any price so to speak and taking us at our word she has made the verybest that was really what we meant wasn t it only what shehas got something thoroughly good it would be difficult itseems to me for her to have anything better once you allow herthe way it s to be taken of course if you don t allow her thatthe case is different her offset is a certain decent freedom which i judge she ll be quite contented with you may say thatwill be very good of her but she strikes me as perfectly humbleabout it she proposes neither to claim it nor to use it with anysort of retentissement she would enjoy it i think quite asquietly as it might be given the boat you see the princeexplained it no less considerately and lucidly is a good dealtied up at the dock or anchored if you like out in the stream i have to jump out from time to time to stretch my legs andyou ll probably perceive if you give it your attention thatcharlotte really can t help occasionally doing the same it isn teven a question sometimes of one s getting to the dock one hasto take a header and splash about in the water call our havingremained here together to night call the accident of my havingput them put our illustrious friends there on my companion strack for i grant you this as a practical result of ourcombination call the whole thing one of the harmless littleplunges off the deck inevitable for each of us why not takethem when they occur as inevitable and above all as notendangering life or limb we shan t drown we shan t sink atleast i can answer for myself mrs verver too moreover do herthe justice visibly knows how to swim he could easily go on for she didn t interrupt him fanny feltnow that she wouldn t have interrupted him for the world shefound his eloquence precious there was not a drop of it that shedidn t in a manner catch as it came for immediate bottling for future preservation the crystal flask of her innermostattention really received it on the spot and she had evenalready the vision of how in the snug laboratory of herafterthought she should be able chemically to analyse it therewere moments positively still beyond this when with themeeting of their eyes something as yet unnamable came out forher in his look when something strange and subtle and atvariance with his words something that gave them away glimmereddeep down as an appeal almost an incredible one to her finercomprehension what inconceivably was it like wasn t it however gross such a rendering of anything so occult fairlylike a quintessential wink a hint of the possibility of theirreally treating their subject of course on some betteroccasion and thereby as well finding it much more interesting if this far red spark which might have been figured by her mindas the head light of an approaching train seen through the lengthof a tunnel was not on her side an ignis fatuus a meresubjective phenomenon it twinkled there at the direct expense ofwhat the prince was inviting her to understand meanwhile too however and unmistakably the real treatment of their subjectdid at a given moment sound this was when he proceeded withjust the same perfect possession of his thought on the manner ofwhich he couldn t have improved to complete his successfulsimile by another in fact by just the supreme touch the touchfor which it had till now been waiting for mrs verver to beknown to people so intensely and exclusively as her husband swife something is wanted that you know they haven t exactlygot he should manage to be known or at least to be seen alittle more as his wife s husband you surely must by this timehave seen for yourself that he has his own habits and his ownways and that he makes more and more as of course he has aperfect right to do his own discriminations he s so perfect soideal a father and doubtless largely by that very fact agenerous a comfortable an admirable father in law that ishould really feel it base to avail myself of any standpointwhatever to criticise him to you nevertheless i may make justone remark for you re not stupid you always understand soblessedly what one means he paused an instant as if even this one remark might bedifficult for him should she give no sign of encouraging him toproduce it nothing would have induced her however to encouragehim she was now conscious of having never in her life stood sostill or sat inwardly as it were so tight she felt like thehorse of the adage brought and brought by her own fault to thewater but strong for the occasion in the one fact that shecouldn t be forced to drink invited in other words tounderstand she held her breath for fear of showing she did andthis for the excellent reason that she was at last fairly afraidto it was sharp for her at the same time that she was certain in advance of his remark that she heard it before it hadsounded that she already tasted in fine the bitterness itwould have for her special sensibility but her companion froman inward and different need of his own was presently notdeterred by her silence what i really don t see is why fromhis own point of view given that is his conditions sofortunate as they stood he should have wished to marry at all there it was then exactly what she knew would come and exactly for reasons that seemed now to thump at her heart as distressingto her yet she was resolved meanwhile not to suffer as theyused to say of the martyrs then and there not to suffer odiously helplessly in public which could be prevented but byher breaking off with whatever inconsequence by her treatingtheir discussion as ended and getting away she suddenly wantedto go home much as she had wanted an hour or two before tocome she wanted to leave well behind her both her question andthe couple in whom it had abruptly taken such vivid form butit was dreadful to have the appearance of disconcerted flight discussion had of itself to her sense become danger suchlight as from open crevices it let in and the overtrecognition of danger was worse than anything else the worst infact came while she was thinking how she could retreat and stillnot overtly recognise her face had betrayed her trouble andwith that she was lost i m afraid however the prince said that i for some reason distress you for which i beg yourpardon we ve always talked so well together it has been fromthe beginning the greatest pull for me nothing so much as sucha tone could have quickened her collapse she felt he had her nowat his mercy and he showed as he went on that he knew it weshall talk again all the same better than ever i depend on ittoo much don t you remember what i told you so definitely oneday before my marriage that moving as i did in so many waysamong new things mysteries conditions expectations assumptions different from any i had known i looked to you asmy original sponsor my fairy godmother to see me through i begyou to believe he added that i look to you yet his very insistence had fortunately the next moment affectedher as bringing her help with which at least she could hold upher head to speak ah you are through you were through longago or if you aren t you ought to be well then if i ought to be it s all the more reason why youshould continue to help me because very distinctly i assureyou i m not the new things or ever so many of them are stillfor me new things the mysteries and expectations and assumptionsstill contain an immense element that i ve failed to puzzle out as we ve happened so luckily to find ourselves again reallytaking hold together you must let me as soon as possible cometo see you you must give me a good kind hour if you refuse itme and he addressed himself to her continued reserve i shallfeel that you deny with a stony stare your responsibility at this as from a sudden shake her reserve proved an inadequatevessel she could bear her own her private reference to theweight on her mind but the touch of another hand made it toohorribly press oh i deny responsibility to you so far as iever had it i ve done with it he had been all the while beautifully smiling but she made hislook now penetrate her again more as to whom then do youconfess it ah mio caro that s if to anyone my own business he continued to look at her hard you give me up then it was what charlotte had asked her ten minutes before and itscoming from him so much in the same way shook her in her place she was on the point of replying do you and she agree togetherfor what you ll say to me but she was glad afterwards to havechecked herself in time little as her actual answer had perhapsbettered it i think i don t know what to make of you you must receive me at least he said oh please not till i m ready for you and though she founda laugh for it she had to turn away she had never turned awayfrom him before and it was quite positively for her as if shewere altogether afraid of him xvilater on when their hired brougham had with the longvociferation that tormented her impatience been extricated fromthe endless rank she rolled into the london night beside herhusband as into a sheltering darkness where she could muffleherself and draw breath she had stood for the previous half hourin a merciless glare beaten upon stared out of countenance itfairly seemed to her by intimations of her mistake for what shewas most immediately feeling was that she had in the past beenactive for these people to ends that were now bearing fruit andthat might yet bear a larger crop she but brooded at first inher corner of the carriage it was like burying her exposed face a face too helplessly exposed in the cool lap of the commonindifference of the dispeopled streets of the closed shops anddarkened houses seen through the window of the brougham a worldmercifully unconscious and unreproachful it wouldn t like theworld she had just left know sooner or later what she had done or would know it at least only if the final consequence shouldbe some quite overwhelming publicity she fixed this possibilityitself so hard however for a few moments that the misery ofher fear produced the next minute a reaction and when thecarriage happened while it grazed a turn to catch the straightshaft from the lamp of a policeman in the act of playing hisinquisitive flash over an opposite house front she let herselfwince at being thus incriminated only that she might protest notless quickly against mere blind terror it had become for theoccasion preposterously terror of which she must shake herselffree before she could properly measure her ground the perceptionof this necessity had in truth soon aided her since she found on trying that lurid as her prospect might hover there shecould none the less give it no name the sense of seeing wasstrong in her but she clutched at the comfort of not being sureof what she saw not to know what it would represent on a longerview was a help in turn to not making out that her hands wereembrued since if she had stood in the position of a producingcause she should surely be less vague about what she hadproduced this further in its way was a step toward reflectingthat when one s connection with any matter was too indirect to betraced it might be described also as too slight to be deplored by the time they were nearing cadogan place she had in factrecognised that she couldn t be as curious as she desired withoutarriving at some conviction of her being as innocent but there had been a moment in the dim desert of eaton square when shebroke into speech it s only their defending themselves so much more than theyneed it s only that that makes me wonder it s their having soremarkably much to say for themselves her husband had as usual lighted his cigar remainingapparently as busy with it as she with her agitation you meanit makes you feel that you have nothing to which as she madeno answer the colonel added what in the world did you eversuppose was going to happen the man s in a position in which hehas nothing in life to do her silence seemed to characterise this statement as superficial and her thoughts as always in her husband s company pursued anindependent course he made her when they were together talk but as if for some other person who was in fact for the mostpart herself yet she addressed herself with him as she couldnever have done without him he has behaved beautifully he didfrom the first i ve thought it all along wonderful of him andi ve more than once when i ve had a chance told him so therefore therefore but it died away as she mused therefore he has a right for a change to kick up his heels it isn t a question of course however she undivertedly wenton of their behaving beautifully apart it s a question oftheir doing as they should when together which is anothermatter and how do you think then the colonel asked with interest that when together they should do the less they do one wouldsay the better if you see so much in it his wife at this appeared to hear him i don t see in it whatyou d see and don t my dear she further answered think itnecessary to be horrid or low about them they re the lastpeople really to make anything of that sort come in right i m surely never horrid or low he returned about anyone butmy extravagant wife i can do with all our friends as i see themmyself what i can t do with is the figures you make of them andwhen you take to adding your figures up but he exhaled itagain in smoke my additions don t matter when you ve not to pay the bill withwhich her meditation again bore her through the air the greatthing was that when it so suddenly came up for her he wasn tafraid if he had been afraid he could perfectly have preventedit and if i had seen he was if i hadn t seen he wasn t so said mrs assingham could i so she declared would i it sperfectly true she went on it was too good a thing for her such a chance in life not to be accepted and i liked his notkeeping her out of it merely from a fear of his own nature itwas so wonderful it should come to her the only thing would havebeen if charlotte herself couldn t have faced it then if shehad not had confidence we might have talked but she had it toany amount did you ask her how much bob assingham patiently inquired he had put the question with no more than his usual modest hopeof reward but he had pressed this time the sharpest spring ofresponse never never it wasn t a time to ask asking issuggesting and it wasn t a time to suggest one had to make upone s mind as quietly as possible by what one could judge andi judge as i say that charlotte felt she could face it forwhich she struck me at the time as for so proud a creature almost touchingly grateful the thing i should never forgive herfor would be her forgetting to whom it is her thanks haveremained most due that is to mrs assingham she said nothing for a little there were after all alternatives maggie herself of course astonishing littlemaggie is maggie then astonishing too and he gloomed out of hiswindow his wife on her side now as they rolled projected the samelook i m not sure that i don t begin to see more in her than dear little person as i ve always thought i ever supposed therewas i m not sure that putting a good many things together i mnot beginning to make her out rather extraordinary you certainly will if you can the colonel resignedly remarked again his companion said nothing then again she broke out infact i do begin to feel it maggie s the great comfort i mgetting hold of it it will be she who ll see us through in factshe ll have to and she ll be able touch by touch her meditation had completed it but with acumulative effect for her husband s general sense of her methodthat caused him to overflow whimsically enough in his corner into an ejaculation now frequent on his lips for the relief that especially in communion like the present it gave him and thatfanny had critically traced to the quaint example the aboriginalhomeliness still so delightful of mr verver oh lordy lordy if she is however mrs assingham continued she ll beextraordinary enough and that s what i m thinking of but i mnot indeed so very sure she added of the person to whomcharlotte ought in decency to be most grateful i mean i m notsure if that person is even almost the incredible little idealistwho has made her his wife i shouldn t think you would be love the colonel with somepromptness responded charlotte as the wife of an incrediblelittle idealist his cigar in short once more could aloneexpress it yet what is that when one thinks but just what she struck oneas more or less persuaded that she herself was really going tobe this memory for the full view fanny found herself alsoinvoking it made her companion in truth slightly gape an incrediblelittle idealist charlotte herself and she was sincere his wife simply proceeded she wasunmistakably sincere the question is only how much is left ofit and that i see happens to be another of the questions youcan t ask her you have to do it all said bob assingham as ifyou were playing some game with its rules drawn up though who sto come down on you if you break them i don t quite see or mustyou do it in three guesses like forfeits on christmas eve towhich as his ribaldry but dropped from her he further added how much of anything will have to be left for you to be able togo on with it i shall go on fanny assingham a trifle grimly declared whilethere s a scrap as big as your nail but we re not yet luckily reduced only to that she had another pause holding the whilethe thread of that larger perception into which her view of mrs verver s obligation to maggie had suddenly expanded even if herdebt was not to the others even then it ought to be quitesufficiently to the prince himself to keep her straight forwhat really did the prince do she asked herself butgenerously trust her what did he do but take it from her that ifshe felt herself willing it was because she felt herself strong that creates for her upon my word mrs assingham pursued aduty of considering him of honourably repaying his trust which well which she ll be really a fiend if she doesn t make thelaw of her conduct i mean of course his trust that she wouldn tinterfere with him expressed by his holding himself quiet at thecritical time the brougham was nearing home and it was perhaps this sense ofebbing opportunity that caused the colonel s next meditation toflower in a fashion almost surprising to his wife they wereunited for the most part but by his exhausted patience so thatindulgent despair was generally at the best his note he atpresent however actually compromised with his despair to theextent of practically admitting that he had followed her steps he literally asked in short an intelligent well nigh asympathising question gratitude to the prince for not havingput a spoke in her wheel that you mean should taking it inthe right way be precisely the ballast of her boat taking it in the right way fanny catching at this gleam emphasised the proviso but doesn t it rather depend on what she may most feel to be theright way no it depends on nothing because there s only one way forduty or delicacy oh delicacy bob assingham rather crudely murmured i mean the highest kind moral charlotte s perfectly capable ofappreciating that by every dictate of moral delicacy she mustlet him alone then you ve made up your mind it s all poor charlotte he askedwith an effect of abruptness the effect whether intended or not reached her brought herface short round it was a touch at which she again lost herbalance at which somehow the bottom dropped out of herrecovered comfort then you ve made up yours differently itreally struck you that there is something the movement itself apparently made him once more stand off hehad felt on his nearer approach the high temperature of thequestion perhaps that s just what she s doing showing him howmuch she s letting him alone pointing it out to him from day today did she point it out by waiting for him to night on the stair case in the manner you described to me i really my dear described to you a manner the colonel clearly from want of habit scarce recognised himself in theimputation yes for once in a way in those few words we had after you hadwatched them come up you told me something of what you had seen you didn t tell me very much that you couldn t for your life but i saw for myself that strange to say you had received yourimpression and i felt therefore that there must indeed have beensomething out of the way for you so to betray it she was fullyupon him now and she confronted him with his proved sensibilityto the occasion confronted him because of her own uneasy need toprofit by it it came over her still more than at the time itcame over her that he had been struck with something even he poor dear man and that for this to have occurred there must havebeen much to be struck with she tried in fact to corner him topack him insistently down in the truth of his plain vision thevery plainness of which was its value for so recorded she felt none of it would escape she should have it at hand forreference come my dear you thought what you thought in thepresence of what you saw you couldn t resist thinking i don task more of it than that and your idea is worth this time quite as much as any of mine so that you can t pretend asusual that mine has run away with me i haven t caught up withyou i stay where i am but i see she concluded where youare and i m much obliged to you for letting me you give me apoint de repere outside myself which is where i like it now ican work round you their conveyance as she spoke stopped at their door and itwas on the spot another fact of value for her that her husband though seated on the side by which they must alight made nomovement they were in a high degree votaries of the latch key so that their household had gone to bed and as they wereunaccompanied by a footman the coachman waited in peace it wasso indeed that for a minute bob assingham waited conscious of areason for replying to this address otherwise than by the soobvious method of turning his back he didn t turn his face buthe stared straight before him and his wife had already perceivedin the fact of his not moving all the proof she could desire proof that is of her own contention she knew he never caredwhat she said and his neglect of his chance to show it wasthereby the more eloquent leave it he at last remarked tothem leave it she wondered let them alone they ll manage they ll manage you mean to do everything they want ah therethen you are they ll manage in their own way the colonel almost crypticallyrepeated it had its effect for her quite apart from its light on thefamiliar phenomenon of her husband s indurated conscience itgave her full in her face the particular evocation of which shehad made him guilty it was wonderful truly then the evocation so cleverly that s your idea that no one will be the wiser it s your idea that we shall have done all that s required of usif we simply protect them the colonel still in his place declined however to be drawninto a statement of his idea statements were too much liketheories in which one lost one s way he only knew what he said and what he said represented the limited vibration of which hisconfirmed old toughness had been capable still none the less he had his point to make for which he took another instant buthe made it for the third time in the same fashion they llmanage in their own way with which he got out oh yes at this for his companion it had indeed its effect andwhile he mounted their steps she but stared without followinghim at his opening of their door their hall was lighted and ashe stood in the aperture looking back at her his tall leanfigure outlined in darkness and with his crush hat according tohis wont worn cavalierly rather diabolically askew he seemedto prolong the sinister emphasis of his meaning in general onthese returns he came back for her when he had prepared theirentrance so that it was now as if he were ashamed to face her incloser quarters he looked at her across the interval and stillin her seat weighing his charge she felt her whole view ofeverything flare up wasn t it simply what had been written inthe prince s own face beneath what he was saying didn t itcorrespond with the mocking presence there that she had had hertroubled glimpse of wasn t in fine the pledge that they would manage in their own way the thing he had been feeling for hischance to invite her to take from him her husband s tone somehowfitted amerigo s look the one that had for her so strangely peeped from behind over the shoulder of the one in front shehad not then read it but wasn t she reading it when she now sawin it his surmise that she was perhaps to be squared she wasn tto be squared and while she heard her companion call across toher well what s the matter she also took time to remindherself that she had decided she couldn t be frightened the matter why it was sufficiently the matter with all this that she felt a little sick for it was not the prince that shehad been prepared to regard as primarily the shaky one shakinessin charlotte she had at the most perhaps postulated it wouldbe she somehow felt more easy to deal with therefore if he hadcome so far it was a different pair of sleeves there was nothingto choose between them it made her so helpless that as the timepassed without her alighting the colonel came back and fairlydrew her forth after which on the pavement under thestreet lamp their very silence might have been the mark ofsomething grave their silence eked out for her by his giving herhis arm and their then crawling up their steps quite mildly andunitedly together like some old darby and joan who have had adisappointment it almost resembled a return from a funeral unless indeed it resembled more the hushed approach to a house ofmourning what indeed had she come home for but to bury asdecently as possible her mistake xviiit appeared thus that they might enjoy together extraordinaryfreedom the two friends from the moment they should understandtheir position aright with the prince himself from an earlystage not unnaturally charlotte had made a great point of theirso understanding it she had found frequent occasion to describeto him this necessity and her resignation tempered or herintelligence at least quickened by irrepressible irony sheapplied at different times different names to the propriety oftheir case the wonderful thing was that her sense of proprietyhad been from the first especially alive about it there werehours when she spoke of their taking refuge in what she calledthe commonest tact as if this principle alone would suffice tolight their way there were others when it might have seemed tolisten to her that their course would demand of them the mostanxious study and the most independent not to say original interpretation of signs she talked now as if it were indicated at every turn by finger posts of almost ridiculous prominence she talked again as if it lurked in devious ways and were to betracked through bush and briar and she even on occasion delivered herself in the sense that as their situation wasunprecedented so their heaven was without stars do sheonce had echoed to him as the upshot of passages covertly thoughbriefly occurring between them on her return from the visit toamerica that had immediately succeeded her marriage determinedfor her by this event as promptly as an excursion of the likestrange order had been prescribed in his own case isn t theimmense the really quite matchless beauty of our position thatwe have to do nothing in life at all nothing except theusual necessary everyday thing which consists in one s notbeing more of a fool than one can help that s all but that s astrue for one time as for another there has been plenty of doing and there will doubtless be plenty still but it s alltheirs every inch of it it s all a matter of what they ve doneto us and she showed how the question had therefore been onlyof their taking everything as everything came and all as quietlyas might be nothing stranger surely had ever happened to aconscientious a well meaning a perfectly passive pair no moreextraordinary decree had ever been launched against such victimsthan this of forcing them against their will into a relation ofmutual close contact that they had done everything to avoid she was to remember not a little meanwhile the particularprolonged silent look with which the prince had met her allusionto these primary efforts at escape she was inwardly to dwell onthe element of the unuttered that her tone had caused to play upinto his irresistible eyes and this because she considered withpride and joy that she had on the spot disposed of the doubt the question the challenge or whatever else might have been that such a look could convey he had been sufficiently off hisguard to show some little wonder as to their having plotted sovery hard against their destiny and she knew well enough ofcourse what in this connection was at the bottom of histhought and what would have sounded out more or less if he hadnot happily saved himself from words all men were brutes enoughto catch when they might at such chances for dissent for all thegood it really did them but the prince s distinction was inbeing one of the few who could check himself before acting on theimpulse this obviously was what counted in a man as delicacy if her friend had blurted or bungled he would have said in hissimplicity did we do everything to avoid it when we facedyour remarkable marriage quite handsomely of course using theplural taking his share of the case by way of a tribute ofmemory to the telegram she had received from him in paris aftermr verver had despatched to rome the news of their engagement that telegram that acceptance of the prospect proposed to them an acceptance quite other than perfunctory she had neverdestroyed though reserved for no eyes but her own it was stillcarefully reserved she kept it in a safe place from which veryprivately she sometimes took it out to read it over a laguerre comme a la guerre then it had been couched in the frenchtongue we must lead our lives as we see them but i am charmedwith your courage and almost surprised at my own the messagehad remained ambiguous she had read it in more lights than one it might mean that even without her his career was up hill workfor him a daily fighting matter on behalf of a good appearance and that thus if they were to become neighbours again the eventwould compel him to live still more under arms it might mean onthe other hand that he found he was happy enough and thataccordingly so far as she might imagine herself a danger shewas to think of him as prepared in advance as really seasonedand secure on his arrival in paris with his wife none the less she had asked for no explanation just as he himself had notasked if the document were still in her possession such aninquiry everything implied was beneath him just as it wasbeneath herself to mention to him uninvited that she hadinstantly offered and in perfect honesty to show the telegramto mr verver and that if this companion had but said the wordshe would immediately have put it before him she had therebyforborne to call his attention to her consciousness that such anexposure would in all probability straightway have dished hermarriage that all her future had in fact for the moment hungby the single hair of mr verver s delicacy as she supposed theymust call it and that her position in the matter ofresponsibility was therefore inattackably straight for the prince himself meanwhile time in its measuredallowance had originally much helped him helped him in thesense of there not being enough of it to trip him up in spite ofwhich it was just this accessory element that seemed at present with wonders of patience to lie in wait time had begotten atfirst more than anything else separations delays andintervals but it was troublesomely less of an aid from themoment it began so to abound that he had to meet the question ofwhat to do with it less of it was required for the state ofbeing married than he had on the whole expected less strangely for the state of being married even as he was married and there was a logic in the matter he knew a logic that butgave this truth a sort of solidity of evidence mr verver decidedly helped him with it with his wedded condition helpedhim really so much that it made all the difference in the degreein which he rendered it the service on mr verver s part wasremarkable as indeed what service from the first of theirmeeting had not been he was living he had been living thesefour or five years on mr verver s services a truth scarcelyless plain if he dealt with them for appreciation one by one than if he poured them all together into the general pot of hisgratitude and let the thing simmer to a nourishing broth to thelatter way with them he was undoubtedly most disposed yet hewould even thus on occasion pick out a piece to taste on itsown merits wondrous at such hours could seem the savour of theparticular treat at his father in law s expense that he moreand more struck himself as enjoying he had needed months andmonths to arrive at a full appreciation he couldn t originallyhave given offhand a name to his deepest obligation but by thetime the name had flowered in his mind he was practically livingat the ease guaranteed him mr verver then in a word took careof his relation to maggie as he took care and apparently alwayswould of everything else he relieved him of all anxiety abouthis married life in the same manner in which he relieved him onthe score of his bank account and as he performed the latteroffice by communicating with the bankers so the former sprang asdirectly from his good understanding with his daughter thisunderstanding had wonderfully that was in high evidence thesame deep intimacy as the commercial the financial associationfounded far down on a community of interest and thecorrespondence for the prince carried itself out in identitiesof character the vision of which fortunately rather tended toamuse than to as might have happened irritate him thosepeople and his free synthesis lumped together capitalists andbankers retired men of business illustrious collectors american fathers in law american fathers little americandaughters little american wives those people were of the samelarge lucky group as one might say they were all at least ofthe same general species and had the same general instincts theyhung together they passed each other the word they spoke eachother s language they did each other turns in this lastconnection it of course came up for our young man at a givenmoment that maggie s relation with him was also on the perceivedbasis taken care of which was in fact the real upshot of thematter it was a funny situation that is it was funny just asit stood their married life was in question but the solutionwas not less strikingly before them it was all right forhimself because mr verver worked it so for maggie s comfort and it was all right for maggie because he worked it so for herhusband s the fact that time however was not as we have said wholly onthe prince s side might have shown for particularly true one darkday on which by an odd but not unprecedented chance thereflections just noted offered themselves as his main recreation they alone it appeared had been appointed to fill the hours forhim and even to fill the great square house in portland place where the scale of one of the smaller saloons fitted them butloosely he had looked into this room on the chance that he mightfind the princess at tea but though the fireside service of therepast was shiningly present the mistress of the table was not and he had waited for her if waiting it could be called whilehe measured again and again the stretch of polished floor hecould have named to himself no pressing reason for seeing her atthis moment and her not coming in as the half hour elapsed became in fact quite positively however perversely thecircumstance that kept him on the spot just there he might havebeen feeling just there he could best take his note thisobservation was certainly by itself meagre amusement for a drearylittle crisis but his walk to and fro and in particular hisrepeated pause at one of the high front windows gave each of theebbing minutes none the less after a time a little more of thequality of a quickened throb of the spirit these throbs scarceexpressed however the impatience of desire any more than theystood for sharp disappointment the series together resembledperhaps more than anything else those fine waves of clearnessthrough which for a watcher of the east dawn at last tremblesinto rosy day the illumination indeed was all for the mind theprospect revealed by it a mere immensity of the world of thought the material outlook was all the while a different matter themarch afternoon judged at the window had blundered back intoautumn it had been raining for hours and the colour of therain the colour of the air of the mud of the opposite houses of life altogether in so grim a joke so idiotic a masquerade was an unutterable dirty brown there was at first even for theyoung man no faint flush in the fact of the direction taken while he happened to look out by a slow jogging four wheeled cabwhich awkwardly deflecting from the middle course at theapparent instance of a person within began to make for theleft hand pavement and so at last under further instructions floundered to a full stop before the prince s windows the personwithin alighting with an easier motion proved to be a lady wholeft the vehicle to wait and putting up no umbrella quicklycrossed the wet interval that separated her from the house shebut flitted and disappeared yet the prince from his standpoint had had time to recognise her and the recognition kept him forsome minutes motionless charlotte stant at such an hour in a shabby four wheeler and awaterproof charlotte stant turning up for him at the very climaxof his special inner vision was an apparition charged with acongruity at which he stared almost as if it had been a violence the effect of her coming to see him him only had while hestood waiting a singular intensity though after some minuteshad passed the certainty of this began to drop perhaps she hadnot come or had come only for maggie perhaps on learning belowthat the princess had not returned she was merely leaving amessage writing a word on a card he should see at any rate and meanwhile controlling himself would do nothing thisthought of not interfering took on a sudden force for him shewould doubtless hear he was at home but he would let her visitto him be all of her own choosing and his view of a reason forleaving her free was the more remarkable that though taking nostep he yet intensely hoped the harmony of her breaking intosight while the superficial conditions were so against her was aharmony with conditions that were far from superficial and thatgave for his imagination an extraordinary value to herpresence the value deepened strangely moreover with the rigourof his own attitude with the fact too that listening hard heneither heard the house door close again nor saw her go back toher cab and it had risen to a climax by the time he had becomeaware with his quickened sense that she had followed the butlerup to the landing from which his room opened if anything couldfurther then have added to it the renewed pause outside as ifshe had said to the man wait a moment would have constitutedthis touch yet when the man had shown her in had advanced tothe tea table to light the lamp under the kettle and had thenbusied himself all deliberately with the fire she made it easyfor her host to drop straight from any height of tension and tomeet her provisionally on the question of maggie while thebutler remained it was maggie that she had come to see and maggiethat in spite of this attendant s high blankness on the subjectof all possibilities on that lady s part she would cheerfully by the fire wait for as soon as they were alone together however she mounted as with the whizz and the red light of arocket from the form to the fact saying straight out as shestood and looked at him what else my dear what in the worldelse can we do it was as if he then knew on the spot why he had been feeling for hours as he had felt as if he in fact knew within theminute things he had not known even while she was panting asfrom the effect of the staircase at the door of the room heknew at the same time none the less that she knew still morethan he in the sense that is of all the signs and portentsthat might count for them and his vision of alternative shecould scarce say what to call them solutions satisfactions opened out altogether with this tangible truth of her attitudeby the chimney place the way she looked at him as through thegained advantage of it her right hand resting on the marble andher left keeping her skirt from the fire while she held out afoot to dry he couldn t have told what particular links and gapshad at the end of a few minutes found themselves renewed andbridged for he remembered no occasion in rome from which thepicture could have been so exactly copied he remembered thatis none of her coming to see him in the rain while a muddyfour wheeler waited and while though having left her waterproofdownstairs she was yet invested with the odd eloquence thepositive picturesqueness yes given all the rest of the matter of a dull dress and a black bowdlerised hat that seemed to make apoint of insisting on their time of life and their moralintention the hat s and the frock s own as well as on the ironyof indifference to them practically playing in her so handsomerain freshened face the sense of the past revived for himnevertheless as it had not yet done it made that other timesomehow meet the future close interlocking with it before hiswatching eyes as in a long embrace of arms and lips and sohandling and hustling the present that this poor quantity scarceretained substance enough scarce remained sufficiently there tobe wounded or shocked what had happened in short was that charlotte and he had by asingle turn of the wrist of fate led up to indeed no doubt by steps and stages that conscious computation had missed beenplaced face to face in a freedom that partook extraordinarily of ideal perfection since the magic web had spun itself withouttheir toil almost without their touch above all on thisoccasion once more there sounded through their safety as anundertone the very voice he had listened to on the eve of hismarriage with such another sort of unrest dimly again andagain from that period on he had seemed to hear it tell him whyit kept recurring but it phrased the large music now in a waythat filled the room the reason was into which he had lived quite intimately by the end of a quarter of an hour that justthis truth of their safety offered it now a kind of unexampledreceptacle letting it spread and spread but at the same timeelastically enclosing it banking it in for softness as withbillows of eiderdown on that morning in the park there hadbeen however dissimulated doubt and danger whereas the talethis afternoon was taken up with a highly emphasised confidence the emphasis for their general comfort was what charlotte hadcome to apply inasmuch as though it was not what she definitelybegan with it had soon irrepressibly shaped itself it was themeaning of the question she had put to him as soon as they werealone even though indeed as from not quite understanding hehad not then directly replied it was the meaning of everythingelse down to the conscious quaintness of her ricketty growler and the conscious humility of her dress it had helped him alittle the question of these eccentricities to let herimmediate appeal pass without an answer he could ask her insteadwhat had become of her carriage and why above all she was notusing it in such weather it s just because of the weather she explained it s mylittle idea it makes me feel as i used to when i could do as iliked xviiithis came out so straight that he saw at once how much truth itexpressed yet it was truth that still a little puzzled him butdid you ever like knocking about in such discomfort it seems to me now that i then liked everything it s the charm at any rate she said from her place at the fire of tryingagain the old feelings they come back they come back everything she went on comes back besides she wound up you know for yourself he stood near her his hands in his pockets but not looking ather looking hard at the tea table ah i haven t your courage moreover he laughed it seems to me that so far as that goes i do live in hansoms but you must awfully want your tea hequickly added so let me give you a good stiff cup he busied himself with this care and she sat down on hispushing up a low seat where she had been standing so that while she talked he could bring her what she further desired hemoved to and fro before her he helped himself and her visit asthe moments passed had more and more the effect of a signalcommunication that she had come all responsibly anddeliberately as on the clear show of the clock face of theirsituation to make the whole demonstration none the less presented itself as taking place at a very high level of debate in the cool upper air of the finer discrimination the deepersincerity the larger philosophy no matter what were the factsinvoked and arrayed it was only a question as yet of theirseeing their way together to which indeed exactly the presentoccasion appeared to have so much to contribute it s not thatyou haven t my courage charlotte said but that you haven t irather think my imagination unless indeed it should turn outafter all she added that you haven t even my intelligence however i shall not be afraid of that till you ve given me moreproof and she made again but more clearly her point of amoment before you knew besides you knew to day i would come and if you knew that you know everything so she pursued and ifhe didn t meanwhile if he didn t even at this take her up itmight be that she was so positively fitting him again with thefair face of temporising kindness that he had given her to keepher eyes on at the other important juncture and the sense ofwhich she might ever since have been carrying about with her likea precious medal not exactly blessed by the pope suspended roundher neck she had come back however this might be to herimmediate account of herself and no mention of their greatprevious passage was to rise to the lips of either above all she said there has been the personal romance of it of tea with me over the fire ah so far as that goes i don tthink even my intelligence fails me oh it s further than that goes and if i ve had a better daythan you it s perhaps when i come to think of it that i ambraver you bore yourself you see but i don t i don t idon t she repeated it s precisely boring one s self without relief he protested that takes courage passive then not active my romance is that if you want toknow i ve been all day on the town literally on the town isn tthat what they call it i know how it feels after which as ifbreaking off and you have you never been out she asked he still stood there with his hands in his pockets what shouldi have gone out for oh what should people in our case do anything for but you rewonderful all of you you know how to live we re clumsy brutes we other s beside you we must always be doing something however charlotte pursued if you had gone out you might havemissed the chance of me which i m sure though you won t confessit was what you didn t want and might have missed above all the satisfaction that look blank about it as you will i ve cometo congratulate you on that s really what i can at last do youcan t not know at least on such a day as this you can t notknow she said where you are she waited as for him either togrant that he knew or to pretend that he didn t but he only drewa long deep breath which came out like a moan of impatience itbrushed aside the question of where he was or what he knew itseemed to keep the ground clear for the question of his visitorherself that of charlotte verver exactly as she sat there so for some moments with their long look they but treated thematter in silence with the effect indeed by the end of thetime of having considerably brought it on this was sufficientlymarked in what charlotte next said there it all is extraordinary beyond words it makes such a relation for us as iverily believe was never before in the world thrust upon twowell meaning creatures haven t we therefore to take things as wefind them she put the question still more directly than that ofa moment before but to this one as well he returned noimmediate answer noticing only that she had finished her tea herelieved her of her cup carried it back to the table asked herwhat more she would have and then on her nothing thanks returned to the fire and restored a displaced log to position bya small but almost too effectual kick she had meanwhile got upagain and it was on her feet that she repeated the words she hadfirst frankly spoken what else can we do what in all the worldelse he took them up however no more than at first where then haveyou been he asked as from mere interest in her adventure everywhere i could think of except to see people i didn t wantpeople i wanted too much to think but i ve been back atintervals three times and then come away again my cabman mustthink me crazy it s very amusing i shall owe him when we cometo settle more money than he has ever seen i ve been my dear she went on to the british museum which you know i alwaysadore and i ve been to the national gallery and to a dozen oldbooksellers coming across treasures and i ve lunched on somestrange nastiness at a cookshop in holborn i wanted to go tothe tower but it was too far my old man urged that and i wouldhave gone to the zoo if it hadn t been too wet which he alsobegged me to observe but you wouldn t believe i did put in st paul s such days she wound up are expensive for besidesthe cab i ve bought quantities of books she immediatelypassed at any rate to another point i can t help wonderingwhen you must last have laid eyes on them and then as it hadapparently for her companion an effect of abruptness maggie imean and the child for i suppose you know he s with her oh yes i know he s with her i saw them this morning and did they then announce their programme she told me she was taking him as usual da nonno and for the whole day he hesitated but it was as if his attitude had slowly shifted she didn t say and i didn t ask well she went on it can t have been later than half pastten i mean when you saw them they had got to eaton squarebefore eleven you know we don t formally breakfast adam and i we have tea in our rooms at least i have but luncheon is early and i saw my husband this morning by twelve he was showing thechild a picture book maggie had been there with them had leftthem settled together then she had gone out taking the carriagefor something he had been intending but that she offered to doinstead the prince appeared to confess at this to his interest taking you mean your carriage i don t know which and it doesn t matter it s not a question she smiled of a carriage the more or the less it s not aquestion even if you come to that of a cab it s so beautiful she said that it s not a question of anything vulgar orhorrid which she gave him time to agree about and though hewas silent it was rather remarkably as if he fell in i wentout i wanted to i had my idea it seemed to me important ithas been it is important i know as i haven t known before theway they feel i couldn t in any other way have made so sure ofit they feel a confidence the prince observed he had indeed said it for her they feel a confidence and sheproceeded with lucidity to the fuller illustration of it speaking again of the three different moments that in the courseof her wild ramble had witnessed her return for curiosity andeven really a little from anxiety to eaton square she waspossessed of a latch key rarely used it had always irritatedadam one of the few things that did to find servants standingup so inhumanly straight when they came home in the small hours after parties so i had but to slip in each time with my cabat the door and make out for myself without their knowing it that maggie was still there i came i went without their somuch as dreaming what do they really suppose she asked becomes of one not so much sentimentally or morally so tocall it and since that doesn t matter but even just physically materially as a mere wandering woman as a decent harmless wife after all as the best stepmother after all that really everwas or at the least simply as a maitresse de maison not quitewithout a conscience they must even in their odd way shedeclared have some idea oh they ve a great deal of idea said the prince and nothingwas easier than to mention the quantity they think so much ofus they think in particular so much of you ah don t put it all on me she smiled but he was putting it now where she had admirably prepared theplace it s a matter of your known character ah thank you for known she still smiled it s a matter of your wonderful cleverness and wonderful charm it s a matter of what those things have done for you in theworld i mean in this world and this place you re a personagefor them and personages do go and come oh no my dear there you re quite wrong and she laughed nowin the happier light they had diffused that s exactly whatpersonages don t do they live in state and under constantconsideration they haven t latch keys but drums and trumpetsannounce them and when they go out in growlers it makes agreater noise still it s you caro mio she said who so faras that goes are the personage ah he in turn protested don t put it all on me what at anyrate when you get home he added shall you say that you vebeen doing i shall say beautifully that i ve been here all day yes all day keeping you company in your solitude how can weunderstand anything she went on without really seeing thatthis is what they must like to think i do for you just as quite as comfortably you do it for me the thing is for us tolearn to take them as they are he considered this a while in his restless way but with hiseyes not turning from her after which rather disconnectedly though very vehemently he brought out how can i not feel morethan anything else how they adore together my boy and then further as if slightly disconcerted she had nothing to meetthis and he quickly perceived the effect they would have donethe same for one of yours ah if i could have had one i hoped and i believed saidcharlotte that that would happen it would have been better itwould have made perhaps some difference he thought so too poorduck that it might have been i m sure he hoped and intended so it s not at any rate she went on my fault there it is shehad uttered these statements one by one gravely sadly andresponsibly owing it to her friend to be clear she pausedbriefly but as if once for all she made her clearnesscomplete and now i m too sure it will never be he waited for a moment never never they treated the matter not exactly with solemnity butwith a certain decency even perhaps urgency of distinctness it would probably have been better charlotte added butthings turn out and it leaves us she made the point morealone he seemed to wonder it leaves you more alone oh she again returned don t put it all on me maggie wouldhave given herself to his child i m sure scarcely less than hegives himself to yours it would have taken more than any childof mine she explained it would have taken more than tenchildren of mine could i have had them to keep our sposiapart she smiled as for the breadth of the image but as heseemed to take it in spite of this for important she thenspoke gravely enough it s as strange as you like but we reimmensely alone he kept vaguely moving but there were momentswhen again with an awkward ease and his hands in his pockets he was more directly before her he stood there at these lastwords which had the effect of making him for a little throw backhis head and as thinking something out stare up at the ceiling what will you say she meanwhile asked that you ve beendoing this brought his consciousness and his eyes back to her and she pointed her question i mean when she comes in for isuppose she will some time come in it seems to me we must saythe same thing well he thought again yet i can scarce pretend to have hadwhat i haven t ah what haven t you had what aren t you having her question rang out as they lingered face to face and he stilltook it before he answered from her eyes we must at leastthen not to be absurd together do the same thing we must act it would really seem in concert it would really seem her eyebrows her shoulders went up quite in gaiety as for the relief this brought her it s all inthe world i pretend we must act in concert heaven knows shesaid they do so it was that he evidently saw and that by his admission thecase could fairly be put but what he evidently saw appeared tocome over him at the same time as too much for him so that hefell back suddenly to ground where she was not awaiting him thedifficulty is and will always be that i don t understand them i didn t at first but i thought i should learn to that was whati hoped and it appeared then that fanny assingham might helpme oh fanny assingham said charlotte verver he stared a moment at her tone she would do anything for us to which charlotte at first said nothing as if from the sense oftoo much then indulgently enough she shook her head we rebeyond her he thought a moment as of where this placed them she d doanything then for them well so would we so that doesn t help us she has broken down she doesn t understand us and really my dear charlotte added fanny assingham doesn t matter he wondered again unless as taking care of them ah charlotte instantly said isn t it for us only to dothat she spoke as with a flare of pride for their privilege andtheir duty i think we want no one s aid she spoke indeed with a nobleness not the less effective forcoming in so oddly with a sincerity visible even through thecomplicated twist by which any effort to protect the father andthe daughter seemed necessarily conditioned for them it movedhim in any case as if some spring of his own a weaker one hadsuddenly been broken by it these things all the while theprivilege the duty the opportunity had been the substance ofhis own vision they formed the note he had been keeping back toshow her that he was not in their so special situation withouta responsible view a conception that he could name and couldact on was something that now at last not to be too eminent afool he was required by all the graces to produce and theluminous idea she had herself uttered would have been hisexpression of it she had anticipated him but as her expressionleft for positive beauty nothing to be desired he felt ratherrighted than wronged a large response as he looked at her cameinto his face a light of excited perception all his own in theglory of which as it almost might be called what he gave herback had the value of what she had given him they reextraordinarily happy oh charlotte s measure of it was only too full beatifically that s the great thing he went on so that it doesn t matter really that one doesn t understand besides you do enough i understand my husband perhaps she after an instant conceded i don t understand your wife you re of the same race at any rate more or less of the samegeneral tradition and education of the same moral paste thereare things you have in common with them but i on my side asi ve gone on trying to see if i haven t some of these thingstoo i on my side have more and more failed there seem at lastto be none worth mentioning i can t help seeing it i mdecidedly too different yet you re not charlotte made the important point toodifferent from me i don t know as we re not married that brings things out perhaps if we were he said you would find some abyss ofdivergence since it depends on that then she smiled i m safe as youare anyhow moreover as one has so often had occasion to feel and even to remark they re very very simple that makes sheadded a difficulty for belief but when once one has taken itin it makes less difficulty for action i have at last formyself i think taken it in i m not afraid he wondered a moment not afraid of what well generally of some beastly mistake especially of anymistake founded on one s idea of their difference for thatidea charlotte developed positively makes one so tender ah but rather well then there it is i can t put myself into maggie s skin ican t as i say it s not my fit i shouldn t be able as i seeit to breathe in it but i can feel that i d do anything toshield it from a bruise tender as i am for her too she wenton i think i m still more so for my husband he s in truth of asweet simplicity the prince turned over a while the sweet simplicity of mr verver well i don t know that i can choose at night all catsare grey i only see how for so many reasons we ought to standtoward them and how to do ourselves justice we do itrepresents for us a conscious care of every hour literally said charlotte she could rise to thehighest measure of the facts and for which we must trust eachother oh as we trust the saints in glory fortunately the princehastened to add we can with which as for the full assuranceand the pledge it involved their hands instinctively found theirhands it s all too wonderful firmly and gravely she kept his hand it s too beautiful and so for a minute they stood together as strongly held and asclosely confronted as any hour of their easier past even had seenthem they were silent at first only facing and faced onlygrasping and grasped only meeting and met it s sacred hesaid at last it s sacred she breathed back to him they vowed it gave itout and took it in drawn by their intensity more closelytogether then of a sudden through this tightened circle as atthe issue of a narrow strait into the sea beyond everythingbroke up broke down gave way melted and mingled their lipssought their lips their pressure their response and theirresponse their pressure with a violence that had sighed itselfthe next moment to the longest and deepest of stillnesses theypassionately sealed their pledge xixhe had taken it from her as we have seen moreover that fannyassingham didn t now matter the now he had even himselfsupplied as no more than fair to his sense of various earlierstages and though his assent remained scarce more than tacit his behaviour for the hour so fell into line that for manydays he kept postponing the visit he had promised his old friendon the occasion of their talk at the foreign office with regret none the less would he have seen it quite extinguished thattheory of their relation as attached pupil and kind instructressin which they had from the first almost equally found aconvenience it had been he no doubt who had most put itforward since his need of knowledge fairly exceeded her mildpretension but he had again and again repeated to her that heshould never without her have been where he was and she hadnot successfully concealed the pleasure it might give her tobelieve it even after the question of where he was had begun toshow itself as rather more closed than open to interpretation ithad never indeed before that evening come up as during thepassage at the official party and he had for the first time atthose moments a little disappointedly got the impression of acertain failure on the dear woman s part of something he wasaware of having always rather freely taken for granted in her ofwhat exactly the failure consisted he would still perhaps havefelt it a little harsh to try to say and if she had in fact asby charlotte s observation broken down the details of thecollapse would be comparatively unimportant they came to thesame thing all such collapses the failure of courage thefailure of friendship or the failure just simply of tact fordidn t any one of them by itself amount really to the failure ofwit which was the last thing he had expected of her and whichwould be but another name for the triumph of stupidity it hadbeen charlotte s remark that they were at last beyond her whereas he had ever enjoyed believing that a certain easyimagination in her would keep up with him to the end he shrankfrom affixing a label to mrs assingham s want of faith but whenhe thought at his ease of the way persons who were capablereally entertained or at least with any refinement the passionof personal loyalty he figured for them a play of fancy neithertimorous nor scrupulous so would his personal loyalty if needbe have accepted the adventure for the good creature herself tothat definite degree that he had positively almost missed theluxury of some such call from her that was what it all came backto again with these people among whom he was married that onefound one used one s imagination mainly for wondering how theycontrived so little to appeal to it he felt at moments as ifthere were never anything to do for them that was worthy to callworthy of the personal relation never any charming charge totake of any confidence deeply reposed he might vulgarly have putit that one had never to plot or to lie for them he mighthumourously have put it that one had never as by the higherconformity to lie in wait with the dagger or to prepare insidiously the cup these were the services that by allromantic tradition were consecrated to affection quite as muchas to hate but he could amuse himself with saying so far as theamusement went that they were what he had once for all turnedhis back on fanny was meanwhile frequent it appeared in eaton square somuch he gathered from the visitor who was not infrequent leastof all at tea time during the same period in portland place though they had little need to talk of her after practicallyagreeing that they had outlived her to the scene of theseconversations and suppressions mrs assingham herself made actually no approach her latest view of her utility seeming tobe that it had found in eaton square its most urgent field itwas finding there in fact everything and everyone but the prince who mostly just now kept away or who at all events on theinterspaced occasions of his calling happened not to encounterthe only person from whom he was a little estranged it wouldhave been all prodigious if he had not already with charlotte said so very considerably lived into it it would have been allindescribably remarkable this fact that with wonderful causesfor it so operating on the surface nobody else as yet in thecombination seemed estranged from anybody if mrs assinghamdelighted in maggie she knew by this time how most easily toreach her and if she was unhappy about charlotte she knew bythe same reasoning how most probably to miss that vision of heron which affliction would feed it might feed of course onfinding her so absent from her home just as this particularphenomenon of her domestic detachment could be by the anxiousmind best studied there fanny was however for her reasons shy of portland place itself this was appreciable so that shemight well after all have no great light on the question ofwhether charlotte s appearances there were frequent or not anymore than on that of the account they might be keeping of theusual solitude since it came to this of the head of that house there was always to cover all ambiguities to constitute a fundof explanation for the divisions of mrs verver s day thecircumstance that at the point they had all reached together mrs verver was definitely and by general acclamation in chargeof the social relations of the family literally of those ofthe two

intercourse fell in withcharlotte s tested facility and not much less visibly with heraccommodating her generous view of her domestic use she hadcome frankly into the connection to do and to be what shecould no questions asked and she had taken over accordingly as it stood and in the finest practical spirit the burden of avisiting list that maggie originally left to herself and lefteven more to the principino had suffered to get inordinately outof hand she had in a word not only mounted cheerfully the londontreadmill she had handsomely professed herself for the furthercomfort of the three

sands the badquarters of an hour that turned up like false pieces in a debasedcurrency of which she made on principle very nearly as lightas if she had not been clever enough to distinguish the princehad on this score paid her his compliment soon after her returnfrom her wedding tour in america where by all accounts she hadwondrously borne the brunt facing brightly at her husband sside

own what could be more simple than one s going through witheverything she had asked when it s so plain a part of one scontract i ve got so much by my marriage for she had neverfor a moment concealed

honour and one s virtue thesethings henceforth if you re interested to know are my rule oflife the absolute little gods of my worship the holy images setup on the wall oh yes since i m not a brute she had wound up you shall see me as i am which was therefore as he had seenher dealing always from month to month from day to day andfrom one occasion to the other with the duties of a remuneratedoffice her perfect her brilliant efficiency had doubtless allthe while contributed immensely to the pleasant ease in whichher husband and her husband s daughter were lapped it had infact probably done something more than this it had given them afiner and sweeter view of the possible scope of that ease theyhad brought her in on the crudest expression of it to do the worldly for them and she had done it with such genius thatthey had themselves in consequence renounced it even more thanthey had originally intended in proportion as she did it moreover was she to be relieved of other and humbler doings which minor matters by the properest logic devolved thereforeupon maggie in whose chords and whose province they morenaturally lay not less naturally by the same token theyincluded the repair at the hands of the latter young woman ofevery stitch conceivably dropped by charlotte in eaton square this was homely work but that was just what made it maggie s bearing in mind dear amerigo who was so much of her own greatmundane feather and whom the homeliness in question didn t nodoubt quite equally provide for that would be to balance justin a manner charlotte s very most charming function from themoment charlotte could be got adequately to recognise it well that charlotte might be appraised as at last notineffectually recognising it was a reflection that during thedays with which we are actually engaged completed in theprince s breast these others these images and ruminations of hisleisure these gropings and fittings of his conscience and hisexperience that we have attempted to set in order there theybore him company not insufficiently considering in especial his fuller resources in that line while he worked out to thelast lucidity the principle on which he forbore either to seekfanny out in cadogan place or to perpetrate the error of toomarked an assiduity in eaton square this error would be his notavailing himself to the utmost of the convenience of any artlesstheory of his constitution or of charlotte s that might prevailthere that artless theories could and did prevail was a fact hehad ended by accepting under copious evidence as definite andultimate and it consorted with common prudence with thesimplest economy of life not to be wasteful of any odd gleaning to haunt eaton square in fine would be to show that he had not like his brilliant associate a sufficiency of work in the world it was just his having that sufficiency it was just their havingit together that so strangely and so blessedly made as theyput it to each other everything possible what further proppedup the case moreover was that the world by still anotherbeautiful perversity of their chance included portland placewithout including to anything like the same extent eaton square the latter residence at the same time it must promptly beadded did on occasion wake up to opportunity and as givingitself a frolic shake send out a score of invitations one ofwhich fitful flights precisely had before easter the effectof disturbing a little our young man s measure of his margin maggie with a proper spirit held that her father ought fromtime to time to give a really considered dinner and mr verver who had as little idea as ever of not meeting expectation was ofthe harmonious opinion that his wife ought charlotte s ownjudgment was always that they were ideally free the proof ofwhich would always be she maintained that everyone they fearedthey might most have alienated by neglect would arrive wreathedwith smiles on the merest hint of a belated signal wreathed insmiles all round truly enough these apologetic banquets struckamerigo as being they were frankly touching occasions to him marked in the great london bousculade with a small still graceof their own an investing amenity and humanity everybody came everybody rushed but all succumbed to the soft influence andthe brutality of mere multitude of curiosity without tenderness was put off at the foot of the fine staircase with theovercoats and shawls the entertainment offered a few eveningsbefore easter and at which maggie and he were inevitably presentas guests was a discharge of obligations not insistentlyincurred and had thereby possibly all the more the note ofthis almost arcadian optimism a large bright dull murmurous mild eyed middle aged dinner involving for the most part verybland though very exalted immensely announceable andhierarchically placeable couples and followed without theoppression of a later contingent by a brief instrumentalconcert over the preparation of which the prince knew maggie sanxiety had conferred with charlotte s ingenuity and both hadsupremely revelled as it were in mr verver s solvency the assinghams were there by prescription though quite at thefoot of the social ladder and with the colonel s wife in spiteof her humility of position the prince was more inwardlyoccupied than with any other person except charlotte he wasoccupied with charlotte because in the first place she lookedso inordinately handsome and held so high where so much else wasmature and sedate the torch of responsive youth and the standardof passive grace and because of the fact that in the second the occasion so far as it referred itself with any confidence ofemphasis to a hostess seemed to refer itself preferentially well meaningly and perversely to maggie it was notindistinguishable to him when once they were all stationed thathis wife too had in perfection her own little character but hewondered how it managed so visibly to simplify itself and this he knew in spite of any desire she entertained to the essentialair of having overmuch on her mind the felicity and indeed thevery conduct and credit of the feast he knew as well theother things of which her appearance was at any time and ineaton square especially made up her resemblance to her father at times so vivid and coming out in the delicate warmth ofoccasions like the quickened fragrance of a flower herresemblance as he had hit it off for her once in rome in thefirst flushed days after their engagement to a littledancing girl at rest ever so light of movement but most oftenpanting gently even a shade compunctiously on a bench herapproximation finally for it was analogy somehow more thanidentity to the transmitted images of rather neutral andnegative propriety that made up in his long line the average ofwifehood and motherhood if the roman matron had been insufficiency first and last the honour of that line maggiewould no doubt at fifty have expanded have solidified to somesuch dignity even should she suggest a little but a cornelia inminiature a light however broke for him in season and whenonce it had done so it made him more than ever aware of mrs verver s vaguely yet quite exquisitely contingentparticipation a mere hinted or tendered discretion in short ofmrs verver s indescribable unfathomable relation to the scene her placed condition her natural seat and neighbourhood herintenser presence her quieter smile her fewer jewels wereinevitably all as nothing compared with the preoccupation thatburned in maggie like a small flame and that had in fact kindledin each of her cheeks a little attesting but fortunately by nomeans unbecoming spot the party was her father s party and itsgreater or smaller success was a question having for her all theimportance of his importance so that sympathy created for her asort of visible suspense under pressure of which she bristledwith filial reference with little filial recalls of expression movement tone it was all unmistakable and as pretty aspossible if one would and even as funny but it put the pair sotogether as undivided by the marriage of each that the princessil n y avait pas a dire might sit where she liked she wouldstill always in that house be irremediably maggie verver theprince found himself on this occasion so beset with thatperception that its natural complement for him would really havebeen to wonder if mr verver had produced on people something ofthe same impression in the recorded cases of his having dinedwith his daughter this backward speculation had it begun to play however wouldhave been easily arrested for it was at present to come overamerigo as never before that his remarkable father in law was theman in the world least equipped with different appearances fordifferent hours he was simple he was a revelation ofsimplicity and that was the end of him so far as he consisted ofan appearance at all a question that might verily for aweakness in it have been argued it amused our young man whowas taking his pleasure to night it will be seen in sundryoccult ways it amused him to feel how everything else the masterof the house consisted of resources possessions facilities andamiabilities amplified by the social legend depended forconveying the effect of quantity on no personal equation nomere measurable medium quantity was in the air for these goodpeople and mr verver s estimable quality was almost wholly inthat pervasion he was meagre and modest and clearbrowed and hiseyes if they wandered without fear yet stayed without defiance his shoulders were not broad his chest was not high hiscomplexion was not fresh and the crown of his head was notcovered in spite of all of which he looked at the top of histable so nearly like a little boy shyly entertaining in virtueof some imposed rank that he could only be one of the powers the representative of a force quite as an infant king is therepresentative of a dynasty in this generalised view of hisfather in law intensified to night but always operative amerigohad now for some time taken refuge the refuge after the reunionof the two households in england had more and more offereditself as the substitute for communities from man to man that by his original calculation might have become possible but thathad not really ripened and flowered he met the decent familyeyes across the table met them afterwards in the music room butonly to read in them still what he had learned to read during hisfirst months the time of over anxious initiation a kind ofapprehension in which the terms and conditions were finally fixedand absolute this directed regard rested at its ease but itneither lingered nor penetrated and was to the prince s fancy much of the same order as any glance directed for due attention from the same quarter to the figure of a cheque received in thecourse of business and about to be enclosed to a banker it madesure of the amount and just so from time to time the amount ofthe prince was made sure he was being thus in renewedinstalments perpetually paid in he already reposed in the bankas a value but subject in this comfortable way to repeated toinfinite endorsement the net result of all of which moreover was that the young man had no wish to see his value diminish hehimself after all had not fixed it the figure was aconception all of mr verver s own certainly however everything must be kept up to it never so much as to night hadthe prince felt this he would have been uncomfortable as thesequiet expressions passed had the case not been guaranteed forhim by the intensity of his accord with charlotte it wasimpossible that he should not now and again meet charlotte seyes as it was also visible that she too now and again met herhusband s for her as well in all his pulses he felt theconveyed impression it put them it kept them together throughthe vain show of their separation made the two other faces madethe whole lapse of the evening the people the lights theflowers the pretended talk the exquisite music a mystic goldenbridge between them strongly swaying and sometimes almostvertiginous for that intimacy of which the sovereign law wouldbe the vigilance of care would be never rashly to forget andnever consciously to wound xxthe main interest of these hours for us however will have beenin the way the prince continued to know during a particularsuccession of others separated from the evening in eaton squareby a short interval a certain persistent aftertaste this wasthe lingering savour of a cup presented to him by fannyassingham s hand after dinner while the clustered quartette kepttheir ranged companions in the music room moved if one would but conveniently motionless mrs assingham contrived after acouple of pieces to convey to her friend that for her part shewas moved by the genius of brahms beyond what she could bear so that without apparent deliberation she had presently floatedaway at the young man s side to such a distance as permittedthem to converse without the effect of disdain it was the twentyminutes enjoyed with her during the rest of the concert in theless associated electric glare of one of the empty rooms it wastheir achieved and as he would have said successful mostpleasantly successful talk on one of the sequestered sofas itwas this that was substantially to underlie his consciousness ofthe later occasion the later occasion then mere matter ofdiscussion had formed her ground for desiring in a lightundertone into which his quick ear read indeed some nervousness these independent words with him she had sounded covertly butdistinctly by the time they were seated together the greatquestion of what it might involve it had come out for him beforeanything else and so abruptly that this almost needed anexplanation then the abruptness itself had appeared to explain which had introduced in turn a slight awkwardness do you knowthat they re not after all going to matcham so that if theydon t if at least maggie doesn t you won t i suppose go byyourself it was as i say at matcham where the event hadplaced him it was at matcham during the easter days that itmost befell him oddly enough to live over inwardly for itswealth of special significance this passage by which the eventhad been really a good deal determined he had paid first andlast many an english country visit he had learned even from ofold to do the english things and to do them all sufficiently in the english way if he didn t always enjoy them madly heenjoyed them at any rate as much to an appearance as the goodpeople who had in the night of time unanimously invented them and who still in the prolonged afternoon of their good faith unanimously even if a trifle automatically practised them yet with it all he had never so much as during such sojourns thetrick of a certain detached the amusement of a certain inwardcritical life the determined need which apparently allparticipant of returning upon itself of backing noiselessly in far in again and rejoining there as it were that part of hismind that was not engaged at the front his body veryconstantly was engaged at the front in shooting in riding ingolfing in walking over the fine diagonals of meadow paths orround the pocketed corners of billiard tables it sufficiently on the whole in fact bore the brunt of bridge playing ofbreakfasting lunching tea drinking dining and of the nightlyclimax over the bottigliera as he called it of the bristlingtray it met finally to the extent of the limited tax on lip on gesture on wit most of the current demands of conversationand expression therefore something of him he often felt atthese times was left out it was much more when he was alone orwhen he was with his own people or when he was say with mrs verver and nobody else that he moved that he talked that helistened that he felt as a congruous whole english society as he would have said cut him accordingly in two and he reminded himself often in his relations with it of a man possessed of a shining star a decoration an order ofsome sort something so ornamental as to make his identity notcomplete ideally without it yet who finding no other suchobject generally worn should be perpetually and the least bitruefully unpinning it from his breast to transfer it to hispocket the prince s shining star may no doubt having beennothing more precious than his private subtlety but whatever theobject was he just now fingered it a good deal out of sight amounting as it mainly did for him to a restless play of memoryand a fine embroidery of thought something had rathermomentously occurred in eaton square during his enjoyed minuteswith his old friend his present perspective made definitelyclear to him that she had plumped out for him her first littlelie that took on and he could scarce have said why a sharpnessof importance she had never lied to him before if only becauseit had never come up for her properly intelligibly morally that she must as soon as she had put to him the question of whathe would do by which she meant of what charlotte would also do in that event of maggie s and mr verver s not embracing theproposal they had appeared for a day or two resignedly toentertain as soon as she had betrayed her curiosity as to theline the other pair so left to themselves might take a desireto avoid the appearance of at all too directly prying had becomemarked in her betrayed by the solicitude of which she had already three weeks before given him a view she had beenobliged on a second thought to name intelligibly a reason forher appeal while the prince on his side had had not withoutmercy his glimpse of her momentarily groping for one and yetremaining unprovided not without mercy because absolutely hehad on the spot in his friendliness invented one for her use presenting it to her with a look no more significant than if hehad picked up to hand back to her a dropped flower you ask ifi m likely also to back out then because it may make adifference in what you and the colonel decide he had gone asfar as that for her fairly inviting her to assent though nothaving had his impression from any indication offered him bycharlotte that the assinghams were really in question for thelarge matcham party the wonderful thing after this was thatthe active couple had in the interval managed to inscribethemselves on the golden roll an exertion of a sort that to doher justice he had never before observed fanny to make thislast passage of the chapter but proved after all with whatsuccess she could work when she would once launched himself at any rate as he had been directed byall the terms of the intercourse between portland place and eatonsquare once steeped at matcham in the enjoyment of a splendidhospitality he found everything for his interpretation for hisconvenience fall easily enough into place and all the more thatmrs verver was at hand to exchange ideas and impressions with the great house was full of people of possible new combinations of the quickened play of possible propinquity and no appearance of course was less to be cultivated than that of his havingsought an opportunity to foregather with his friend at a safedistance from their respective sposi there was a happy boldness at the best in their mingling thus each unaccompanied in thesame sustained sociability just exactly a touch of thateccentricity of associated freedom which sat so lightly on theimagination of the relatives left behind they were exposed asmuch as one would to its being pronounced funny that they should at such a rate go about together though on the other hand this consideration drew relief from the fact that in their highconditions and with the easy tradition the almost inspiringallowances of the house in question no individual line howeverfreely marked was pronounced anything more than funny both ourfriends felt afresh as they had felt before the convenience ofa society so placed that it had only its own sensibility toconsider looking as it did well over the heads of all lowergrowths and that moreover treated its own sensibility quite asthe easiest friendliest most informal and domesticated party tothe general alliance what anyone thought of anyone else aboveall of anyone else with anyone else was a matter incurring inthese lulls so little awkward formulation that hovering judgment the spirit with the scales might perfectly have been imagedthere as some rather snubbed and subdued but quite trained andtactful poor relation of equal of the properest lineage onlyof aspect a little dingy doubtless from too limited a change ofdress for whose tacit and abstemious presence never betrayed bya rattle of her rusty machine a room in the attic and a plate atthe side table were decently usual it was amusing in suchlightness of air that the prince should again present himselfonly to speak for the princess so unfortunately unable again to leave home and that mrs verver should as regularly figure asan embodied a beautifully deprecating apology for her husband who was all geniality and humility among his own treasures butas to whom the legend had grown up that he couldn t bear withthe height of his standards and the tone of the company in theway of sofas and cabinets habitually kept by him the irritationand depression to which promiscuous visiting even at pompoushouses had been found to expose him that was all right thenoted working harmony of the clever son in law and the charmingstepmother so long as the relation

of fortune and appetite so diffused among hisfellow guests that the poor assinghams in their comparativelymarked maturity and their comparatively small splendour were theonly approach to a false note in the concert the stir of the airwas such for going in a degree to one s head that as a merematter of exposure almost grotesque in its flagrancy hissituation resembled some elaborate practical joke carried out athis expense every voice in the great bright house was a call tothe ingenuities and impunities of pleasure every echo was adefiance of difficulty doubt or danger every aspect of

of the powers the only handsome the onlygallant in fact the only intelligent acceptance of which was afaith in its guarantees and a high spirit for its chances itsdemand to that the thing came back was above all for courageand good humour and the value of this as a general assurance that is for seeing one through at the worst had not even in theeasiest hours of his old roman life struck the prince soconvincingly his old roman life had had more poetry no doubt but as he looked back upon it now it seemed to hang in the air ofmere iridescent horizons to have been loose and vague and thin with large languorous unaccountable blanks the present order asit spread about him had somehow the ground under its feet and atrumpet in its ears and a bottomless bag of solid shiningbritish sovereigns which was much to the point in its hand courage and good humour therefore were the breath of the day though for ourselves at least it would have been also much to thepoint that with amerigo really the innermost effect of allthis perceptive ease was perhaps a strange final irritation hecompared the lucid result with the extraordinary substitute forperception that presided in the bosom of his wife at socontented a view of his conduct and course a state of mind thatwas positively like a vicarious good conscience cultivatedingeniously on his behalf a perversity of pressure innocentlypersisted in and this wonder of irony became on occasion toointense to be kept wholly to himself it wasn t that at matcham anything particular anything monstrous anything that had to benoticed permitted itself as they said to happen there wereonly odd moments when the breath of the day as it has beencalled struck him so full in the face that he broke out with allthe hilarity of what indeed would they have made of it they were of course maggie and her father moping so far as they everconsented to mope in monotonous eaton square but placid too inthe belief that they knew beautifully what their expertcompanions were in for they knew it might have appeared inthese lights absolutely nothing on earth worth speaking of whether beautifully or cynically and they would perhapssometimes be a little less trying if they would only once for allpeacefully admit that knowledge wasn t one of their needs andthat they were in fact constitutionally inaccessible to it theywere good children bless their hearts and the children of goodchildren so that verily the principino himself as lessconsistently of that descent might figure to the fancy as theripest genius of the trio the difficulty was for the nerves of daily intercourse withmaggie in particular that her imagination was clearly neverruffled by the sense of any anomaly the great anomaly would havebeen that her husband or even that her father s wife shouldprove to have been made for the long run after the pattern setfrom so far back to the ververs if one was so made one hadcertainly no business on any terms at matcham whereas if onewasn t one had no business there on the particular terms termsof conformity with the principles of eaton square under whichone had been so absurdly dedicated deep at the heart of thatresurgent unrest in our young man which we have had to contentourselves with calling his irritation deep in the bosom of thisfalsity of position glowed the red spark of his inextinguishablesense of a higher and braver propriety there were situationsthat were ridiculous but that one couldn t yet help as forinstance when one s wife chose in the most usual way to makeone so precisely here however was the difference it had takenpoor maggie to invent a way so extremely unusual yet to which none the less it would be too absurd that he should merely lendhimself being thrust systematically with another woman and awoman one happened by the same token exceedingly to like andbeing so thrust that the theory of it seemed to publish one asidiotic or incapable this was a predicament of which the dignitydepended all on one s own handling what was supremely grotesque in fact was the essential opposition of theories as if agalantuomo as he at least constitutionally conceivedgalantuomini could do anything but blush to go about at such arate with such a person as mrs verver in a state of childlikeinnocence the state of our primitive parents before the fall the grotesque theory as he would have called it was perhaps anodd one to resent with violence and he did it also as a man ofthe world all merciful justice but assuredly none the less there was but one way really to mark and for his companion asmuch as for himself the commiseration in which they held it adequate comment on it could only be private but it could alsoat least be active and of rich and effectual comment charlotteand he were fortunately alike capable wasn t this consensusliterally their only way not to be ungracious it was positivelyas if the measure of their escape from that danger were given bythe growth between them during their auspicious visit of anexquisite sense of complicity xxihe found himself therefore saying with gaiety even to fannyassingham for their common concerned glance at eaton square the glance that was so markedly never as it might have been aglance at portland place what would our cari sposi have made ofit here what would they you know really which overflowwould have been reckless if already and surprisingly perhapseven to himself he had not got used to thinking of this friendas a person in whom the element of protest had of late beenunmistakably allayed he exposed himself of course to herreplying ah if it would have been so bad for them how can itbe so good for you but quite apart from the small sense thequestion would have had at the best she appeared already tounite with him in confidence and cheer he had his view aswell or at least a partial one of the inner spring of thispresent comparative humility which was all consistent with theretraction he had practically seen her make after mr verver slast dinner without diplomatising to do so with no effort tosquare her none to bribe her to an attitude for which he wouldhave had no use in her if it were not sincere he yet felt how heboth held her and moved her by the felicity of his taking pity all instinctively on her just discernible depression by just somuch as he guessed that she felt herself as the slang was outof it out of the crystal current and the expensive picture byjust so much had his friendship charmingly made up to her fromhour to hour for the penalties as they might have been grosslycalled of her mistake her mistake had only been after all inher wanting to seem to him straight she had let herself in forbeing as she had made haste for that matter during the veryfirst half hour at tea to proclaim herself the sole and singlefrump of the party the scale of everything was so different thatall her minor values her quainter graces her little localauthority her humour and her wardrobe alike for which it wasenough elsewhere among her bons amis that they were hers dearfanny assingham s these matters and others would be all now asnought five minutes had sufficed to give her the fatal pitch incadogan place she could always at the worst be picturesque forshe habitually spoke of herself as local to sloane streetwhereas at matcham she should never be anything but horrible andit all would have come the disaster from the real refinement in her of the spirit of friendship to prove to him that shewasn t really watching him ground for which would have been tooterribly grave she had followed him in his pursuit of pleasure so she might precisely mark her detachment this was handsometrouble for her to take the prince could see it all it wasn t ashade of interference that a good natured man would visit on her so he didn t even say when she told him how frumpy she knewherself how frumpy her very maid odiously going back on her rubbed it into her night and morning with unsealed eyes andlips that she now knew her he didn t then say ah see whatyou ve done isn t it rather your own fault he behaveddifferently altogether eminently distinguished himself for shetold him she had never seen him so universally distinguished heyet distinguished her in her obscurity or in what was worse herobjective absurdity and frankly invested her with her absolutevalue surrounded her with all the importance of her wit thatwit as discriminated from stature and complexion a sense for bridge and a credit for pearls could have importance wasmeanwhile but dimly perceived at matcham so that his niceness to her she called it only niceness but it brought tears intoher eyes had the greatness of a general as well as of a specialdemonstration she understands he said as a comment on all this to mrs verver she understands all she needs to understand she hastaken her time but she has at last made it out for herself shesees how all we can desire is to give them the life they prefer to surround them with the peace and quiet and above all with thesense of security most favourable to it she can t of coursevery well put it to us that we have so far as she is concerned but to make the best of our circumstances she can t say in somany words don t think of me for i too must make the best ofmine arrange as you can only and live as you must i don tget quite that from her any more than i ask for it but her toneand her whole manner mean nothing at all unless they mean thatshe trusts us to take as watchful to take as artful to take astender care in our way as she so anxiously takes in hers sothat she s well the prince wound up what you may callpractically all right charlotte in fact however to help outhis confidence didn t call it anything return as he might tothe lucidity the importance or whatever it was of this lesson she gave him no aid toward reading it aloud she let him two orthree times over spell it out for himself only on the eve oftheir visit s end was she for once clear or direct in response they had found a minute together in the great hall of the houseduring the half hour before dinner this easiest of chances theyhad already a couple of times arrived at by waitingpersistently till the last other loiterers had gone to dress andby being prepared themselves to dress so expeditiously that theymight a little later on be among the first to appear in festalarray the hall then was empty before the army of rearranging cushion patting housemaids were marshalled in and there was aplace by the forsaken fire at one end where they might imitate with art the unpremeditated above all here for the snatchedinstants they could breathe so near to each other that theinterval was almost engulfed in it and the intensity both of theunion and the caution became a workable substitute for contact they had prolongations of instants that counted as visions ofbliss they had slow approximations that counted as longcaresses the quality of these passages in truth made thespoken word and especially the spoken word about other people fall below them so that our young woman s tone had even now acertain dryness it s very good of her my dear to trust us but what else can she do why whatever people do when they don t trust let one see theydon t but let whom see well let me say to begin with and should you mind that he had a slight show of surprise shouldn t you her letting you see no said charlotte the only thing i canimagine myself minding is what you yourself if you don t lookout may let her see to which she added you may let her see you know that you re afraid i m only afraid of you a little at moments he presentlyreturned but i shan t let fanny see that it was clear however that neither the limits nor the extent ofmrs assingham s vision were now a real concern to her and shegave expression to this as she had not even yet done what inthe world can she do against us there s not a word that she canbreathe she s helpless she can t speak she would be herselfthe first to be dished by it and then as he seemed slow tofollow it all comes back to her it all began with her everything from the first she introduced you to maggie shemade your marriage the prince might have had his moment of demur but at this aftera little as with a smile dim but deep he came on mayn t shealso be said a good deal to have made yours that was intended i think wasn t it for a kind of rectification charlotte on her side for an instant hesitated then she wasprompter still i don t mean there was anything to rectify everything was as it had to be and i m not speaking of how shemay have been concerned for you and me i m speaking of how shetook in her way each time their lives in hand and how therefore that ties her up to day she can t go to them and say it s very awkward of course you poor dear things but i wasfrivolously mistaken he took it in still with his long look at her all the morethat she wasn t she was right everything s right he went on and everything will stay so then that s all i say but he worked it out for the deeper satisfaction even tosuperfluous lucidity we re happy and they re happy what moredoes the position admit of what more need fanny assingham want ah my dear said charlotte it s not i who say that she needwant anything i only say that she s fixed that she must standexactly where everything has by her own act placed her it syou who have seemed haunted with the possibility for her ofsome injurious alternative something or other we must beprepared for and she had with her high reasoning a strangecold smile we are prepared for anything for everything andas we are practically so she must take us she s condemned toconsistency she s doomed poor thing to a genial optimism that luckily for her however is very much the law of hernature she was born to soothe and to smooth now then therefore mrs verver gently laughed she has the chance ofher life so that her present professions may even at the best not besincere may be but a mask for doubts and fears and for gainingtime the prince had looked with the question as if this again could trouble him and it determined in his companion a slightimpatience you keep talking about such things as if they wereour affair at all i feel at any rate that i ve nothing to dowith her doubts and fears or with anything she may feel shemust arrange all that for herself it s enough for me that she llalways be of necessity much more afraid for herself really either to see or to speak than we should be to have her do iteven if we were the idiots and cowards we aren t andcharlotte s face with these words to the mitigation of theslightly hard ring there might otherwise have been in them fairly lightened softened shone out it reflected as reallynever yet the rare felicity of their luck it made her look forthe moment as if she had actually pronounced that word ofunpermitted presumption so apt is the countenance as with afiner consciousness than the tongue to betray a sense of thisparticular lapse she might indeed the next instant have seenher friend wince in advance at her use of a word that wasalready on her lips for it was still unmistakable with him thatthere were things he could prize forms of fortune he couldcherish without at all proportionately liking their names hadall this however been even completely present to his companion what other term could she have applied to the strongest andsimplest of her ideas but the one that exactly fitted it sheapplied it then though her own instinct moved her at the sametime to pay her tribute to the good taste from which they hadn theretofore by a hair s breadth deviated if it didn t sound sovulgar i should say that we re fatally as it were safe pardonthe low expression since it s what we happen to be we re sobecause they are and they re so because they can t be anythingelse from the moment that having originally intervened forthem she wouldn t now be able to bear herself if she didn t keepthem so that s the way she s inevitably with us said charlotteover her smile we hang essentially together well the prince candidly allowed she did bring it home to him every way it worked out yes i see we hang essentially together his friend had a shrug a shrug that had a grace cosavolete the effect beautifully nobly was more than roman ah beyond doubt it s a case he stood looking at her it s a case there can t he said have been many perhaps never never never any other that she smiled iconfess i should like to think only ours only ours most probably speriamo to which as after hushedconnections he presently added poor fanny but charlotte hadalready with a start and a warning hand turned from a glance atthe clock she sailed away to dress while he watched her reachthe staircase his eyes followed her till with a simple swiftlook round at him she vanished something in the sight however appeared to have renewed the spring of his last exclamation which he breathed again upon the air poor poor fanny it was to prove however on the morrow quite consistent withthe spirit of these words that the party at matcham breaking upand multitudinously dispersing he should be able to meet thequestion of the social side of the process of repatriation withdue presence of mind it was impossible for reasons that heshould travel to town with the assinghams it was impossible forthe same reasons that he should travel to town save in theconditions that he had for the last twenty four hours beenprivately and it might have been said profoundly thinking out the result of his thought was already precious to him and thisput at his service he sufficiently believed the right tone fordisposing of his elder friend s suggestion an assumption in factequally full and mild that he and charlotte would convenientlytake the same train and occupy the same compartment as thecolonel and herself the extension of the idea to mrs verver hadbeen precisely a part of mrs assingham s mildness and nothingcould better have characterised her sense for social shades thanher easy perception that the gentleman from portland place andthe lady from eaton square might now confess quite withoutindiscretion to simultaneity of movement she had made for thefour days no direct appeal to the latter personage but theprince was accidental witness of her taking a fresh start at themoment the company were about to scatter for the last night oftheir stay there had been at this climax the usual preparatorytalk about hours and combinations in the midst of which poorfanny gently approached mrs verver she said you and theprince love quite apparently without blinking she took forgranted their public withdrawal together she remarked that sheand bob were alike ready in the interest of sociability to takeany train that would make them all one party i feel really asif all this time i had seen nothing of you that gave an addedgrace to the candour of the dear thing s approach but just thenit was on the other hand that the young man found himselfborrow most effectively the secret of the right tone for doing ashe preferred his preference had during the evening not failedof occasion to press him with mute insistences practicallywithout words without any sort of straight telegraphy it hadarrived at a felt identity with charlotte s own she spoke allfor their friend while she answered their friend s question butshe none the less signalled to him as definitely as if she hadfluttered a white handkerchief from a window it s awfully sweetof you darling our going together would be charming but youmustn t mind us you must suit yourselves we ve settled amerigoand i to stay over till after luncheon amerigo with the chink of this gold in his ear turned straightaway so as not to be instantly appealed to and for the veryemotion of the wonder furthermore of what divination mayachieve when winged by a community of passion charlotte haduttered the exact plea that he had been keeping ready for thesame foreseen necessity and had uttered it simply as aconsequence of their deepening unexpressed need of each other andwithout the passing between them of a word he hadn t god knew to take it from her he was too conscious of what he wanted butthe lesson for him was in the straight clear tone that charlottecould thus distil in the perfect felicity of her adding noexplanation no touch for plausibility that she wasn t strictlyobliged to add and in the truly superior way in which women sosituated express and distinguish themselves she had answeredmrs assingham quite adequately she had not spoiled it by areason a scrap larger than the smallest that would serve and shehad above all thrown off for his stretched but coveredattention an image that flashed like a mirror played at the faceof the sun the measure of everything to all his sense at thesemoments was in it the measure especially of the thought thathad been growing with him a positive obsession and that began tothrob as never yet under this brush of her having by perfectparity of imagination the match for it his whole consciousnesshad by this time begun almost to ache with a truth of anexquisite order at the glow of which she too had sounmistakably then been warming herself the truth that theoccasion constituted by the last few days couldn t possibly saveby some poverty of their own refuse them some still other andstill greater beauty it had already told them with an hourlyvoice that it had a meaning a meaning that their associatedsense was to drain even as thirsty lips after the plough throughthe sands and the sight afar of the palm cluster might drinkin at last the promised well in the desert there had beenbeauty day after day and there had been for the spirituallips something of the pervasive taste of it yet it was all none the less as if their response had remained below theirfortune how to bring it by some brave free lift up to thesame height was the idea with which behind and beneatheverything he was restlessly occupied and in the exploration ofwhich as in that of the sun chequered greenwood of romance hisspirit thus at the opening of a vista met hers they werealready from that moment so hand in hand in the place that hefound himself making use five minutes later of exactly the sametone as charlotte s for telling mrs assingham that he waslikewise in the matter of the return to london sorry for whatmightn t be this had become of a sudden the simplest thing in the world the sense of which moreover seemed really to amount to a portentthat he should feel forevermore on the general head conveniently at his ease with her he went in fact a step furtherthan charlotte put the latter forward as creating his necessity she was staying over luncheon to oblige their hostess as aconsequence of which he must also stay to see her decently home he must deliver her safe and sound he felt in eaton square regret as he might too the difference made by this obligation he frankly didn t mind inasmuch as over and above the pleasureitself his scruple would certainly gratify both mr verver andmaggie they never yet had absolutely and entirely learned heeven found deliberation to intimate how little he reallyneglected the first as it seemed nowadays quite to have become of his domestic duties therefore he still constantly felt howlittle he must remit his effort to make them remark it to whichhe added with equal lucidity that they would return in time fordinner and if he didn t as a last word subjoin that it wouldbe lovely of fanny to find on her own return a moment to goto eaton square and report them as struggling bravely on thiswas not because the impulse down to the very name for theamiable act altogether failed to rise his inward assurance hisgeneral plan had at moments where she was concerned its dropsof continuity and nothing would less have pleased him than thatshe should suspect in him however tempted any element ofconscious cheek but he was always that was really theupshot cultivating thanklessly the considerate and the delicate it was a long lesson this unlearning with people of englishrace all the little superstitions that accompany friendship mrs assingham herself was the first to say that she wouldunfailingly report she brought it out in fact he thought quite wonderfully having attained the summit of the wonderfulduring the brief interval that had separated her appeal tocharlotte from this passage with himself she had taken the fiveminutes obviously amid the rest of the talk and the movement to retire into her tent for meditation which showed amongseveral things the impression charlotte had made on her it wasfrom the tent she emerged as with arms refurbished though whoindeed could say if the manner in which she now met him spokemost really of the glitter of battle or of the white waver ofthe flag of truce the parley was short either way the gallantryof her offer was all sufficient i ll go to our friends then i ll ask for luncheon i ll tellthem when to expect you that will be charming say we re all right all right precisely i can t say more mrs assingham smiled no doubt but he considered as for the possible importance ofit neither can you by what i seem to feel say less oh i won t say less fanny laughed with which the nextmoment she had turned away but they had it again not lessbravely on the morrow after breakfast in the thick of theadvancing carriages and the exchange of farewells i think i llsend home my maid from euston she was then prepared to amend and go to eaton square straight so you can be easy oh i think we re easy the prince returned be sure to say at any rate that we re bearing up you re bearing up good and charlotte returns to dinner to dinner we re not likely i think to make another nightaway well then i wish you at least a pleasant day oh he laughed as they separated we shall do our best forit after which in due course with the announcement of theirconveyance the assinghams rolled off xxiiit was quite for the prince after this as if the view hadfurther cleared so that the half hour during which he strolledon the terrace and smoked the day being lovely overflowed withthe plenitude of its particular quality its general brightnesswas composed doubtless of many elements but what shone out ofit as if the whole place and time had been a great picture fromthe hand of genius presented to him as a prime ornament for hiscollection and all varnished and framed to hang up what markedit especially for the highest appreciation was hisextraordinarily unchallenged his absolutely appointed andenhanced possession of it poor fanny assingham s challengeamounted to nothing one of the things he thought of while heleaned on the old marble balustrade so like others that he knewin still more nobly terraced italy was that she was squared all conveniently even to herself and that rumbling towardlondon with this contentment she had become an image irrelevantto the scene it further passed across him as his imaginationwas for reasons during the time unprecedentedly active thathe had after all gained more from women than he had ever lostby them there appeared so more and more on those mystic booksthat are kept in connection with such commerce even by men ofthe loosest business habits a balance in his favour that hecould pretty well as a rule take for granted what were theydoing at this very moment wonderful creatures but combine andconspire for his advantage from maggie herself most wonderful in her way of all to his hostess of the present hour intowhose head it had so inevitably come to keep charlotte on forreasons of her own and who had asked in this benevolent spirit why in the world if not obliged without plausibility to hurry her husband s son in law should not wait over in her company hewould at least see lady castledean had said that nothingdreadful should happen to her either while still there or duringthe exposure of the run to town and for that matter if theyexceeded a little their license it would positively help them tohave done so together each of them would in this way at home have the other comfortably to blame all of which besides inlady castledean as in maggie in fanny assingham as in charlotteherself was working for him without provocation or pressure bythe mere play of some vague sense on their part definite andconscious at the most only in charlotte that he was not as anature as a character as a gentleman in fine below hisremarkable fortune but there were more things before him than even these thingsthat melted together almost indistinguishably to feed his senseof beauty if the outlook was in every way spacious and thetowers of three cathedrals in different counties as had beenpointed out to him gleamed discernibly like dim silver in therich sameness of tone didn t he somehow the more feel it sobecause precisely lady castledean had kept over a man of herown and that this offered a certain sweet intelligibility as thenote of the day it made everything fit above all it divertedhim to the extent of keeping up while he lingered and waited his meditative smile she had detained charlotte because shewished to detain mr blint and she couldn t detain mr blint disposed though he clearly was to oblige her without spreadingover the act some ampler drapery castledean had gone up tolondon the place was all her own she had had a fancy for aquiet morning with mr blint a sleek civil accomplished youngman distinctly younger than her ladyship who played and sangdelightfully played even bridge and sang the english comic aswell as the french tragic and the presence which really meantthe absence of a couple of other friends if they were happilychosen would make everything all right the prince had thesense all good humouredly of being happily chosen and it wasnot spoiled for him even by another sense that followed in itstrain and with which during his life in england he had morethan once had reflectively to deal the state of being remindedhow after all as an outsider a foreigner and even as a mererepresentative husband and son in law he was so irrelevant tothe working of affairs that he could be bent on occasion to usescomparatively trivial no other of her guests would have beenthus convenient for their hostess affairs of whatever sorts had claimed by early trains every active easy smoothly working man each in his way a lubricated item of thegreat social political administrative engrenage claimed mostof all castledean himself who was so very oddly given thepersonage and the type rather a large item if he on the otherhand had an affair it was not of that order it was of theorder verily that he had been reduced to as a not quiteglorious substitute it marked however the feeling of the hour with him that thisvision of being reduced interfered not at all with the measureof his actual ease it kept before him again at moments the sofamiliar fact of his sacrifices down to the idea of the veryrelinquishment for his wife s convenience of his real situationin the world with the consequence thus that he was in thelast analysis among all these so often inferior people practically held cheap and made light of but though all this wassensible enough there was a spirit in him that could rise aboveit a spirit that positively played with the facts with all ofthem from that of the droll ambiguity of english relations tothat of his having in mind something quite beautiful andindependent and harmonious something wholly his own he couldn tsomehow take mr blint seriously he was much more an outsider by the larger scale even than a roman prince who consented to bein abeyance yet it was past finding out either how such awoman as lady castledean could take him since this question butsank for him again into the fathomless depths of englishequivocation he knew them all as was said well he had livedwith them stayed with them dined hunted shot and done variousother things with them but the number of questions about them hecouldn t have answered had much rather grown than shrunken sothat experience struck him for the most part as having left inhim but one residual impression they didn t like les situationsnettes that was all he was very sure of they wouldn t have themat any price it had been their national genius and theirnational success to avoid them at every point they called itthemselves with complacency their wonderful spirit ofcompromise the very influence of which actually so hung abouthim here from moment to moment that the earth and the air thelight and the colour the fields and the hills and the sky theblue green counties and the cold cathedrals owed to it everyaccent of their tone verily as one had to feel in presence ofsuch a picture it had succeeded it had made up to now forthat seated solidity in the rich sea mist on which the garish the supposedly envious peoples have ever cooled their eyes butit was at the same time precisely why even much initiation leftone at given moments so puzzled as to the element of stalenessin all the freshness and of freshness in all the staleness ofinnocence in the guilt and of guilt in the innocence there wereother marble terraces sweeping more purple prospects on whichhe would have known what to think and would have enjoyed therebyat least the small intellectual fillip of a discerned relationbetween a given appearance and a taken meaning the inquiringmind in these present conditions might it was true be moresharply challenged but the result of its attention and itsingenuity it had unluckily learned to know was too often to beconfronted with a mere dead wall a lapse of logic a confirmedbewilderment and moreover above all nothing mattered in therelation of the enclosing scene to his own consciousness but itsvery most direct bearings lady castledean s dream of mr blint for the morning wasdoubtless already with all the spacious harmonies re established taking the form of going over something with him at the piano in one of the numerous smaller rooms that wereconsecrated to the less gregarious uses what she had wished hadbeen effected her convenience had been assured this made him however wonder the more where charlotte was since he didn t atall suppose her to be making a tactless third which would be tohave accepted mere spectatorship in the duet of theircompanions the upshot of everything for him alike of the lessand of the more was that the exquisite day bloomed there like alarge fragrant flower that he had only to gather but it was tocharlotte he wished to make the offering and as he moved alongthe terrace which rendered visible parts of two sides of thehouse he looked up at all the windows that were open to theapril morning and wondered which of them would represent hisfriend s room it befell thus that his question after no longtime was answered he saw charlotte appear above as if she hadbeen called by the pausing of his feet on the flags she had cometo the sill on which she leaned to look down and she remainedthere a minute smiling at him he had been immediately struckwith her wearing a hat and a jacket which conduced to herappearance of readiness not so much to join him with a beautifuluncovered head and a parasol where he stood as to take with himsome larger step altogether the larger step had been since theevening before intensely in his own mind though he had notfully thought out even yet the slightly difficult detail of it but he had had no chance such as he needed to speak thedefinite word to her and the face she now showed affected him accordingly as a notice that she had wonderfully guessed it forherself they had these identities of impulse they had had themrepeatedly before and if such unarranged but unerring encountersgave the measure of the degree in which people were in thecommon phrase meant for each other no union in the world hadever been more sweetened with rightness what in fact most oftenhappened was that her rightness went as who should say evenfurther than his own they were conscious of the same necessityat the same moment only it was she as a general thing who mostclearly saw her way to it something in her long look at him nowout of the old grey window something in the very poise of herhat the colour of her necktie the prolonged stillness of hersmile touched into sudden light for him all the wealth of thefact that he could count on her he had his hand there to pluckit on the open bloom of the day but what did the bright minutemean but that her answering hand was already intelligently out so therefore while the minute lasted it passed between themthat their cup was full which cup their very eyes holding itfast carried and steadied and began as they tasted it topraise he broke however after a moment the silence it only wants a moon a mandolin and a little danger to be aserenade ah then she lightly called down let it at least have this with which she detached a rich white rosebud from its companywith another in the front of her dress and flung it down to him he caught it in its fall fixing her again after she had watchedhim place it in his buttonhole come down quickly he said inan italian not loud but deep vengo vengo she as clearly but more lightly tossed out andshe had left him the next minute to wait for her he came along the terrace again with pauses during which hiseyes rested as they had already often done on the brave darkerwash of far away watercolour that represented the most distant ofthe cathedral towns this place with its great church and itshigh accessibility its towers that distinguishably signalled its english history its appealing type its acknowledgedinterest this place had sounded its name to him half the nightthrough and its name had become but another name thepronounceable and convenient one for that supreme sense ofthings which now throbbed within him he had kept saying tohimself gloucester gloucester gloucester quite as if thesharpest meaning of all the years just passed were intenselyexpressed in it that meaning was really that his situationremained quite sublimely consistent with itself and that theyabsolutely he and charlotte stood there together in the verylustre of this truth every present circumstance helped toproclaim it it was blown into their faces as by the lips of themorning he knew why from the first of his marriage he hadtried with such patience for such conformity he knew why he hadgiven up so much and bored himself so much he knew why he atany rate had gone in on the basis of all forms on the basis ofhis having in a manner sold himself for a situation nette ithad all been just in order that his well what on earth shouldhe call it but his freedom should at present be as perfect androunded and lustrous as some huge precious pearl he hadn tstruggled nor snatched he was taking but what had been givenhim the pearl dropped itself with its exquisite quality andrarity straight into his hand here precisely it was incarnate its size and its value grew as mrs verver appeared afar off in one of the smaller doorways she came toward him insilence while he moved to meet her the great scale of thisparticular front at matcham multiplied thus in the goldenmorning the stages of their meeting and the successions of theirconsciousness it wasn t till she had come quite close that heproduced for her his gloucester gloucester gloucester and his look at it over there she knew just where to look yes isn t it one of the best there are cloisters or towers or some thing and her eyes which though her lips smiled were almost grave with theirdepths of acceptance came back to him or the tomb of some oldking we must see the old king we must do the cathedral he said we must know all about it if we could but take he exhaled the full opportunity and then while for all they seemed togive him he sounded again her eyes i feel the day like a greatgold cup that we must somehow drain together i feel it as you always make me feel everything just as youdo so that i know ten miles off how you feel but do youremember she asked apropos of great gold cups the beautifulone the real one that i offered you so long ago and that youwouldn t have just before your marriage she brought it back tohim the gilded crystal bowl in the little bloomsbury shop oh yes but it took with a slight surprise on the prince spart some small recollecting the treacherous cracked thing youwanted to palm off on me and the little swindling jew whounderstood italian and who backed you up but i feel this anoccasion he immediately added and i hope you don t mean hesmiled that as an occasion it s also cracked they spoke naturally more low than loud overlooked as theywere though at a respectful distance by tiers of windows butit made each find in the other s voice a taste as of somethingslowly and deeply absorbed don t you think too much of cracks and aren t you too afraid of them i risk the cracks said charlotte and i ve often recalled the bowl and the littleswindling jew wondering if they ve parted company he made shesaid a great impression on me well you also no doubt made a great impression on him and idare say that if you were to go back to him you d find he hasbeen keeping that treasure for you but as to cracks the princewent on what did you tell me the other day you prettily callthem in english rifts within the lute risk them as much asyou like for yourself but don t risk them for me he spoke itin all the gaiety of his just barely tremulous serenity i go as you know by my superstitions and that s why he said iknow where we are they re every one to day on our side resting on the parapet toward the great view she was silent alittle and he saw the next moment that her eyes were closed igo but by one thing her hand was on the sun warmed stone sothat turned as they were away from the house he put hisown upon it and covered it i go by you she said i go byyou so they remained a moment till he spoke again with a gesturethat matched what is really our great necessity you know isto go by my watch it s already eleven he had looked at thetime so that if we stop here to luncheon what becomes of ourafternoon to this charlotte s eyes opened straight there s not theslightest need of our stopping here to luncheon don t you see she asked how i m ready he had taken it in but there wasalways more and more of her you mean you ve arranged it s easy to arrange my maid goes up with my things you veonly to speak to your man about yours and they can go together you mean we can leave at once she let him have it all one of the carriages about which ispoke will already have come back for us if your superstitionsare on our side she smiled so my arrangements are and i llback my support against yours then you had thought he wondered about gloucester she hesitated but it was only her way i thought you wouldthink we have thank goodness these harmonies they are foodfor superstition if you like it s beautiful she went on thatit should be gloucester glo ster glo ster as you say makingit sound like an old song however i m sure glo ster glo sterwill be charming she still added we shall be able easily tolunch there and with our luggage and our servants off ourhands we shall have at least three or four hours we can wire she wound up from there ever so quietly she had brought it as she had thought it allout and it had to be as covertly that he let his appreciationexpand then lady castledean doesn t dream of our staying he took it but thinking yet then what does she dream of mr blint poor dear of mr blint only her smile for him for the prince himself was free have i positively to tell youthat she doesn t want us she only wanted us for the others toshow she wasn t left alone with him now that that s done andthat they ve all gone she of course knows for herself knows the prince vaguely echoed why that we like cathedrals that we inevitably stop to seethem or go round to take them in whenever we ve a chance thatit s what our respective families quite expect of us and would bedisappointed for us to fail of this as forestieri mrs ververpursued would be our pull if our pull weren t indeed so greatall round he could only keep his eyes on her and have you made out thevery train the very one paddington the in that gives us oceans we can dine at the usual hour at home and as maggie will ofcourse be in eaton square i hereby invite you for a while he still but looked at her it was a minute before hespoke thank you very much with pleasure to which he in amoment added but the train for gloucester a local one with several stops but doing it a gooddeal i forget how much within the hour so that we ve time only she said we must employ our time he roused himself as from the mere momentary spell of her helooked again at his watch while they moved back to the doorthrough which she had advanced but he had also again questionsand stops all as for the mystery and the charm you looked itup without my having asked you ah my dear she laughed i ve seen you with bradshaw ittakes anglo saxon blood blood he echoed you ve that of every race it kept herbefore him you re terrible well he could put it as he liked i know the name of the inn what is it then there are two you ll see but i ve chosen the right one and ithink i remember the tomb she smiled oh the tomb any tomb would do for him but i mean i hadbeen keeping my idea so cleverly for you while there you alreadywere with it you had been keeping it for me as much as you like but how doyou make out she asked that you were keeping it from me i don t now how shall i ever keep anything some day when ishall wish to ah for things i mayn t want to know i promise you shall findme stupid they had reached their door where she herself pausedto explain these days yesterday last night this morning i ve wanted everything well it was all right you shall have everything xxiiifanny on her arrival in town carried out her second idea despatching the colonel to his club for luncheon and packing hermaid into a cab for cadogan place with the variety of theireffects the result of this for each of the pair was a state ofoccupation so unbroken that the day practically passed withoutfresh contact between them they dined out together but it wasboth in going to their dinner and in coming back that theyappeared on either side to have least to communicate fanny waswrapped in her thoughts still more closely than in the lemon coloured mantle that protected her bare shoulders and herhusband with her silence to deal with showed himself not lessdisposed than usual when so challenged to hold up as he wouldhave said his end of it they had in general in these days longer pauses and more abrupt transitions in one of which latterthey found themselves for a climax launched at midnight mrs assingham rather wearily housed again ascended to the firstfloor there to sink overburdened on the landing outside thedrawing room into a great gilded venetian chair of which atfirst however she but made with her brooding face a sort ofthrone of meditation she would thus have recalled a little withher so free orientalism of type the immemorially speechlesssphinx about at last to become articulate the colonel notunlike on his side some old pilgrim of the desert camping atthe foot of that monument went by way of reconnoissance intothe drawing room he visited according to his wont the windowsand their fastenings he cast round the place the eye all atonce of the master and the manager the commandant and therate payer then he came back to his wife before whom for amoment he stood waiting but she herself for a time continuedto wait only looking up at him inscrutably there was in theseminor manoeuvres and conscious patiences something of asuspension of their old custom of divergent discussion thatintercourse by misunderstanding which had grown so clumsy now this familiar pleasantry seemed to desire to show it could yield on occasion to any clear trouble though it was also sensibly and just incoherently in the air that no trouble was at presentto be vulgarly recognised as clear there might for that matter even have been in mr assingham sface a mild perception of some finer sense a sense for hiswife s situation and the very situation she was oddly enough about to repudiate that she had fairly caused to grow in him but it was a flower to breathe upon gently and this was verymuch what she finally did she knew he needed no telling that shehad given herself all the afternoon to her friends in eatonsquare and that her doing so would have been but the promptresult of impressions gathered in quantities in brimmingbaskets like the purple grapes of the vintage at matcham aprocess surrounded by him while it so unmistakably went on withabstentions and discretions that might almost have counted assolemnities the solemnities at the same time had committed himto nothing to nothing beyond this confession itself of aconsciousness of deep waters she had been out on these waters for him visibly and his tribute to the fact had been hiskeeping her even if without a word well in sight he had notquitted for an hour during her adventure the shore of themystic lake he had on the contrary stationed himself where shecould signal to him at need her need would have arisen if theplanks of her bark had parted then some sort of plunge wouldhave become his immediate duty his present position clearly was that of seeing her in the centre of her sheet of dark water and of wondering if her actual mute gaze at him didn t perhapsmean that her planks were now parting he held himself so readythat it was quite as if the inward man had pulled off coat andwaistcoat before he had plunged however that is before he haduttered a question he perceived not without relief that shewas making for land he watched her steadily paddle always alittle nearer and at last he felt her boat bump the bump wasdistinct and in fact she stepped ashore we were all wrong there s nothing nothing it was like giving her his hand up the bank between charlotte verver and the prince i was uneasy but i msatisfied now i was in fact quite mistaken there s nothing but i thought said bob assingham that that was just what youdid persistently asseverate you ve guaranteed their straightnessfrom the first no i ve never till now guaranteed anything but my owndisposition to worry i ve never till now fanny went on gravelyfrom her chair had such a chance to see and to judge i had itat that place if i had in my infatuation and my folly sheadded with expression nothing else so i did see i have seen and now i know her emphasis as she repeated the word made herhead in her seat of infallibility rise higher i know the colonel took it but took it at first in silence do youmean they ve told you no i mean nothing so absurd for in the first place i haven tasked them and in the second their word in such a matterwouldn t count oh said the colonel with all his oddity they d tell us it made her face him an instant as with her old impatience of hisshort cuts always across her finest flower beds but she felt none the less that she kept her irony down then when they vetold you you ll be perhaps so good as to let me know he jerked up his chin testing the growth of his beard with theback of his hand while he fixed her with a single eye ah idon t say that they d necessarily tell me that they are over thetraces they ll necessarily whatever happens hold their tongues ihope and i m talking of them now as i take them for myself only that s enough for me it s all i have to regard with which after an instant they re wonderful said fanny assingham indeed her husband concurred i really think they are you d think it still more if you knew but you don t know because you don t see their situation this was what he didn tsee is too extraordinary too he was willing to try too extraordinary to be believed i mean if one didn t see butjust that in a way is what saves them they take it seriously he followed at his own pace their situation the incredible side of it they make it credible credible then you do say to you she looked at him again for an interval they believe in itthemselves they take it for what it is and that she said saves them but if what it is is just their chance it s their chance for what i told you when charlotte firstturned up it s their chance for the idea that i was then sureshe had the colonel showed his effort to recall oh your idea atdifferent moments of any one of their ideas this dimprocession visibly mustered before him and with the best willin the world he could but watch its immensity are you speakingnow of something to which you can comfortably settle down again for a little she only glowered at him i ve come backto my belief and that i have done so well he asked as she paused well shows that i m right for i assure you i had wandered far now i m at home again and i mean said fanny assingham tostay here they re beautiful she declared the prince and charlotte the prince and charlotte that s how they re so remarkable andthe beauty she explained is that they re afraid for them afraid i mean for the others for mr verver and maggie it did take some following afraidof what afraid of themselves the colonel wondered of themselves of mr verver s andmaggie s selves mrs assingham remained patient as well as lucid yes of suchblindness too but most of all of their own danger he turned it over that danger being the blindness that danger being their position what their position contains of all the elements i needn t at this time of day attempt totell you it contains luckily for that s the mercy everything but blindness i mean on their part the blindness said fanny is primarily her husband s he stood for a moment he would have it straight whosehusband s mr verver s she went on the blindness is most of all his that they feel that they see but it s also his wife s whose wife s he asked as she continued to gloom at him in amanner at variance with the comparative cheer of her contention and then as she only gloomed the prince s maggie s own maggie s very own she pursued as for herself he had a pause do you think maggie so blind the question isn t of what i think the question s of theconviction that guides the prince and charlotte who have betteropportunities than i for judging the colonel again wondered are you so very sure theiropportunities are better well his wife asked what is their whole so extraordinarysituation their extraordinary relation but an opportunity ah my dear you have that opportunity of their extraordinarysituation and relation as much as they with the difference darling she returned with some spirit that neither of those matters are if you please mine i seethe boat they re in but i m not thank god in it myself to day however mrs assingham added to day in eaton square idid see well then what but she mused over it still oh many things more somehow than ever before it was as if god help me i was seeing forthem i mean for the others it was as if something hadhappened i don t know what except some effect of these dayswith them at that place that had either made things come out orhad cleared my own eyes these eyes indeed of the poor lady srested on her companion s meanwhile with the lustre not so muchof intenser insight as of a particular portent that he had atvarious other times had occasion to recognise she desired obviously to reassure him but it apparently took a couple oflarge candid gathering glittering tears to emphasisethe fact they had immediately for him their usual directaction she must reassure him he was made to feel absolutely inher own way he would adopt it and conform to it as soon as heshould be able to make it out the only thing was that it tooksuch incalculable twists and turns the twist seemed remarkablefor instance as she developed her indication of what had come outin the afternoon it was as if i knew better than ever whatmakes them what makes them he pressed her as she fitfully dropped well makes the prince and charlotte take it all as they do itmight well have been difficult to know how to take it and theymay even say for themselves that they were a long time trying tosee as i say to day she went on it was as if i weresuddenly with a kind of horrible push seeing through theireyes on which as to shake off her perversity fannyassingham sprang up but she remained there under the dimillumination and while the colonel with his high dry sparelook of type to which a certain conformity to the whiteness ofinaccessible snows in his necktie shirt front and waistcoat gavea rigour of accent waited watching her they might at the latehour and in the still house have been a pair of specious worldlyadventurers driven for relief under sudden stress to some grimmidnight reckoning in an odd corner her attention movedmechanically over the objects of ornament disposed too freely onthe walls of staircase and landing as to which recognition forthe time had lost both fondness and compunction i can imaginethe way it works she said it s so easy to understand yet idon t want to be wrong she the next moment broke out i don t i don t want to be wrong to make a mistake you mean oh no she meant nothing of the sort she knew but too well whatshe meant i don t make mistakes but i perpetrate in thought crimes and she spoke with all intensity i m a most dreadfulperson there are times when i seem not to mind a bit what i vedone or what i think or imagine or fear or accept when i feelthat i d do it again feel that i d do things myself ah my dear the colonel remarked in the coolness of debate yes if you had driven me back on my nature luckily for youyou never have you ve done every thing else but you ve neverdone that but what i really don t a bit want she declared isto abet them or to protect them her companion turned this over what is there to protect themfrom if by your now so settled faith they ve done nothingthat justly exposes them and it in fact half pulled her up well from a sudden scare from the alarm i mean of what maggie may think yet if your whole idea is that maggie thinks nothing she waited again it isn t my whole idea nothing is my whole idea for i felt to day as i tell you that there s somuch in the air oh in the air the colonel dryly breathed well what s in the air always has hasn t it to come down tothe earth and maggie mrs assingham continued is a verycurious little person since i was in this afternoon forseeing more than i had ever done well i felt that too for somereason as i hadn t yet felt it for some reason for what reason and then as his wife atfirst said nothing did she give any sign was she in any waydifferent she s always so different from anyone else in the world thatit s hard to say when she s different from herself but she hasmade me said fanny after an instant think of her differently she drove me home home here first to portland place on her leaving her father since shedoes once in a while leave him that was to keep me with her alittle longer but she kept the carriage and after tea there came with me herself back here this was also for the samepurpose then she went home though i had brought her a messagefrom the prince that arranged their movements otherwise he andcharlotte must have arrived if they have arrived expecting todrive together to eaton square and keep maggie on to dinnerthere she has everything there you know she has clothes the colonel didn t in fact know but he gave it his apprehension oh you mean a change twenty changes if you like all sorts of things she dresses really maggie does as much for her father and she always did as for her husband or for herself she has her room in his housevery much as she had it before she was married and just as theboy has quite a second nursery there in which mrs noble whenshe comes with him makes herself i assure you at home si bienthat if charlotte in her own house so to speak should wish afriend or two to stay with her she really would be scarce ableto put them up it was a picture into which as a thrifty entertainer himself bob assingham could more or less enter maggie and the childspread so maggie and the child spread so well he considered it is rather rum that s all i claim she seemed thankful for the word i don tsay it s anything more but it is distinctly rum which after an instant the colonel took up more what morecould it be it could be that she s unhappy and that she takes her funnylittle way of consoling herself for if she were unhappy mrs assingham had figured it out that s just the way i mconvinced she would take but how can she be unhappy since asi m also convinced she in the midst of everything adores herhusband as much as ever the colonel at this brooded for a little at large then if she sso happy please what s the matter it made his wife almost spring at him you think then she ssecretly wretched but he threw up his arms in deprecation ah my dear i givethem up to you i ve nothing more to suggest then it s not sweet of you she spoke at present as if he werefrequently sweet you admit that it is rum and this indeed fixed again for a moment his intention hascharlotte complained of the want of rooms for her friends never that i know of a word it isn t the sort of thing shedoes and whom has she after all mrs assingham added tocomplain to hasn t she always you oh me charlotte and i nowadays she spoke as of achapter closed yet see the justice i still do her she strikesme more and more as extraordinary a deeper shade at the renewal of the word had come into thecolonel s face if they re each and all so extraordinary then isn t that why one must just resign one s self to wash one shands of them to be lost her face however so met thequestion as if it were but a flicker of the old tone that theirtrouble had now become too real for her charged eyes so betrayedthe condition of her nerves that he stepped back alertly enough to firmer ground he had spoken before in this light of a plainman s vision but he must be something more than a plain man now hasn t she then charlotte always her husband to complain to she d rather die oh and bob assingham s face at the vision of suchextremities lengthened for very docility hasn t she the princethen for such matters oh he doesn t count i thought that was just what as the basis of our agitation hedoes do mrs assingham however had her distinction ready not a bit asa person to bore with complaints the ground of my agitation is exactly that she never on any pretext bores him not charlotte and in the imagination of mrs verver s superiority to any suchmistake she gave characteristically something like a toss ofher head as marked a tribute to that lady s general grace inall the conditions as the personage referred to doubtless hadever received ah only maggie with which the colonel gave a short lowgurgle but it found his wife again prepared no not only maggie a great many people in london and smallwonder bore him maggie only worst then but it was a question that he hadpromptly dropped at the returning brush of another of which shehad shortly before sown the seed you said just now that hewould by this time be back with charlotte if they have arrived you think it then possible that they really won t have returned his companion exhibited to view for the idea a sense of herresponsibility but this was insufficient clearly to keep herfrom entertaining it i think there s nothing they re not nowcapable of in their so intense good faith good faith he echoed the words which had in fact somethingof an odd ring critically their false position it comes to the same thing and she boredown with her decision the superficial lack of sequence theymay very possibly for a demonstration as i see them not havecome back he wondered visibly at this how she did see them may havebolted somewhere together may have stayed over at matcham itself till tomorrow may havewired home each of them since maggie left me may have done fanny assingham continued god knows what she went on suddenly with more emotion which at the pressure of somespring of her inner vision broke out in a wail of distress imperfectly smothered whatever they ve done i shall never know never never because i don t want to and because nothing willinduce me so they may do as they like but i ve worked for themall she uttered this last with another irrepressible quaver andthe next moment her tears had come though she had with theexplosion quitted her husband as if to hide it from him shepassed into the dusky drawing room where during his own prowl shortly previous he had drawn up a blind so that the light ofthe street lamps came in a little at the window she made forthis window against which she leaned her head while thecolonel with his lengthened face looked after her for a minuteand hesitated he might have been wondering what she had reallydone to what extent beyond his knowledge or his conception inthe affairs of these people she could have committed herself but to hear her cry and yet try not to was quickly enough toomuch for him he had known her at other times quite not try notto and that had not been so bad he went to her and put his armround her he drew her head to his breast where while shegasped she let it stay a little all with a patience thatpresently stilled her yet the effect of this small crisis oddlyenough was not to close their colloquy with the natural resultof sending them to bed what was between them had opened outfurther had somehow through the sharp show of her feeling taken a positive stride had entered as it were without morewords the region of the understood shutting the door after itand bringing them so still more nearly face to face theyremained for some minutes looking at it through the dim windowwhich opened upon the world of human trouble in general and whichlet the vague light play here and there upon gilt and crystal andcolour the florid features looming dimly of fanny sdrawing room and the beauty of what thus passed between them passed with her cry of pain with her burst of tears with hiswonderment and his kindness and his comfort with the moments oftheir silence above all which might have represented theirsinking together hand in hand for a time into the mystic lakewhere he had begun as we have hinted by seeing her paddlealone the beauty of it was that they now could really talkbetter than before because the basis had at last once for all defined itself what was the basis which fanny absolutelyexacted but that charlotte and the prince must be saved so faras consistently speaking of them as still safe might save them it did save them somehow for fanny s troubled mind for thatwas the nature of the mind of women he conveyed to her now atall events by refusing her no gentleness that he hadsufficiently got the tip and that the tip was all he had wanted this remained quite clear even when he presently reverted to whatshe had told him of her recent passage with maggie i don taltogether see you know what you infer from it or why youinfer anything when he so expressed himself it was quite as ifin possession of what they had brought up from the depths xxiv i can t say more this made his companion reply than thatsomething in her face her voice and her whole manner acted uponme as nothing in her had ever acted before and just for thereason above all that i felt her trying her very best and hervery best poor duck is very good to be quiet and natural it swhen one sees people who always are natural making little pale pathetic blinking efforts for it then it is that one knowssomething s the matter i can t describe my impression you wouldhave had it for yourself and the only thing that ever can be thematter with maggie is that by that i mean her beginning todoubt to doubt for the first time mrs assingham wound up of her wonderful little judgment of her wonderful little world it was impressive fanny s vision and the colonel as if himselfagitated by it took another turn of prowling to doubt offidelity to doubt of friendship poor duck indeed it will gohard with her but she ll put it all he concluded oncharlotte mrs assingham still darkly contemplative denied this with aheadshake she won t put it anywhere she won t do with itanything anyone else would she ll take it all herself you mean she ll make it out her own fault yes she ll find means somehow to arrive at that ah then the colonel dutifully declared she s indeed a littlebrick oh his wife returned you ll see in one way or another towhat tune and she spoke of a sudden with an approach toelation so that as if immediately feeling his surprise sheturned round to him she ll see me somehow through see you yes me i m the worst for said fanny assingham now with aharder exaltation i did it all i recognise that i accept it she won t cast it up at me she won t cast up anything so ithrow myself upon her she ll bear me up she spoke almostvolubly she held him with her sudden sharpness she ll carrythe whole weight of us there was still nevertheless wonder in it you mean she won tmind i say love and he not unkindly stared then where sthe difficulty there isn t any fanny declared with the same rich emphasis it kept him indeed as by the loss of the thread looking at herlonger ah you mean there isn t any for us she met his look for a minute as if it perhaps a little too muchimputed a selfishness a concern at any cost for their ownsurface then she might have been deciding that their own surfacewas after all what they had most to consider not she saidwith dignity if we properly keep our heads she appeared evento signify that they would begin by keeping them now this waswhat it was to have at last a constituted basis do you rememberwhat you said to me that night of my first real anxiety afterthe foreign office party in the carriage as we came home yes he could recall it leave them to pull through precisely trust their own wit you practically said to saveall appearances well i ve trusted it i have left them to pullthrough he hesitated and your point is that they re not doing so i ve left them she went on but now i see how and where i vebeen leaving them all the while without knowing it to her to the princess and that s what i mean mrs assingham pensively pursued that s what happened to me with her to day she continued toexplain it came home to me that that s what i ve really beendoing oh i see i needn t torment myself she has taken them over the colonel declared that he saw yet it was as if at this hea little sightlessly stared but what then has happened fromone day to the other to her what has opened her eyes they were never really shut she misses him then why hasn t she missed him before well facing him there among their domestic glooms and glints fanny worked it out she did but she wouldn t let herself knowit she had her reason she wore her blind now at last hersituation has come to a head to day she does know it and that silluminating it has been mrs assingham wound up illuminating to me her husband attended but the momentary effect of his attentionwas vagueness again and the refuge of his vagueness was a gasp poor dear little girl ah no don t pity her this did however pull him up we mayn t even be sorry forher not now or at least not yet it s too soon that is if it isn tvery much too late this will depend mrs assingham went on at any rate we shall see we might have pitied her before forall the good it would then have done her we might have begunsome time ago now however she has begun to live and the wayit comes to me the way it comes to me but again she projectedher vision the way it comes to you can scarcely be that she ll like it the way it comes to me is that she will live the way it comesto me is that she ll triumph she said this with so sudden a prophetic flare that it fairlycheered her husband ah then we must back her no we mustn t touch her we mayn t touch any of them we mustkeep our hands off we must go on tiptoe we must simply watchand wait and meanwhile said mrs assingham we must bear itas we can that s where we are and serves us right we re inpresence and so moving about the room as in communion with shadowyportents she left it till he questioned again in presence ofwhat well of something possibly beautiful beautiful as it may comeoff she had paused there before him while he wondered you meanshe ll get the prince back she raised her hand in quick impatience the suggestion mighthave been almost abject it isn t a question of recovery itwon t be a question of any vulgar struggle to get him back shemust have lost him and to have lost him she must have had him with which fanny shook her head what i take her to be wakingup to is the truth that all the while she really hasn t hadhim never ah my dear the poor colonel panted never his wife repeated and she went on without pity do youremember what i said to you long ago that evening just beforetheir marriage when charlotte had so suddenly turned up the smile with which he met this appeal was not it was to befeared robust what haven t you love said in your time so many things no doubt that they make a chance for my havingonce or twice spoken the truth i never spoke it more at allevents than when i put it to you that evening that maggie wasthe person in the world to whom a wrong thing could least becommunicated it was as if her imagination had been closed to it her sense altogether sealed that therefore fanny continued is what will now have to happen her sense will have to open i see he nodded to the wrong he nodded again almostcheerfully as if he had been keeping the peace with a baby or alunatic to the very very wrong but his wife s spirit after its effort of wing was able toremain higher to what s called evil with a very big e for thefirst time in her life to the discovery of it to the knowledgeof it to the crude experience of it and she gave for thepossibility the largest measure to the harsh bewilderingbrush the daily chilling breath of it unless indeed and heremrs assingham noted a limit unless indeed as yet so far asshe has come and if she comes no further simply to thesuspicion and the dread what we shall see is whether that meredose of alarm will prove enough he considered but enough for what then dear if not enough tobreak her heart enough to give her a shaking mrs assingham rather oddlyreplied to give her i mean the right one the right one won tbreak her heart it will make her she explained well it willmake her by way of a change understand one or two things in theworld but isn t it a pity the colonel asked that they shouldhappen to be the one or two that will be the most disagreeable toher oh disagreeable they ll have had to be disagreeable toshow her a little where she is they ll have had to bedisagreeable to make her sit up they ll have had to bedisagreeable to make her decide to live bob assingham was now at the window while his companion slowlyrevolved he had lighted a cigarette for final patience and heseemed vaguely to time her as she moved to and fro he had atthe same time to do justice to the lucidity she had at lastattained and it was doubtless by way of expression of thisteachability that he let his eyes for a minute roll as fromthe force of feeling over the upper dusk of the room he hadthought of the response his wife s words ideally implied decide to live ah yes for her child oh bother her child and he had never felt so snubbed for anexemplary view as when fanny now stopped short to live youpoor dear for her father which is another pair of sleeves and mrs assingham s whole ample ornamented person irradiated with this the truth that had begun under so much handling toglow any idiot can do things for her child she ll have amotive more original and we shall see how it will work her she ll have to save him to save him to keep her father from her own knowledge that and she seemedto see it before her in her husband s very eyes will be workcut out with which as at the highest conceivable climax shewound up their colloquy good night there was something in her manner however or in the effect atleast of this supreme demonstration that had fairly and by asingle touch lifted him to her side so that after she hadturned her back to regain the landing and the staircase heovertook her before she had begun to mount with the ring ofexcited perception ah but you know that s rather jolly jolly she turned upon it again at the foot of thestaircase i mean it s rather charming charming it had still to be their law a little that shewas tragic when he was comic i mean it s rather beautiful you just said yourself it wouldbe only he pursued promptly with the impetus of this idea and as if it had suddenly touched with light for him connectionshitherto dim only i don t quite see why that very care for himwhich has carried her to such other lengths precisely as affectone as so rum hasn t also by the same stroke made her noticea little more what has been going on ah there you are it s the question that i ve all along beenasking myself she had rested her eyes on the carpet but sheraised them as she pursued she let him have it straight andit s the question of an idiot an idiot well the idiot that i ve been in all sorts of ways so often of late have i asked it you re excusable since you ask it butnow the answer i saw to day has all the while been staring mein the face then what in the world is it why the very intensity of her conscience about him the verypassion of her brave little piety that s the way it has worked mrs assingham explained and i admit it to have been as rum away as possible but it has been working from a rum start fromthe moment the dear man married to ease his daughter off and itthen happened by an extraordinary perversity that the veryopposite effect was produced with the renewed vision of thisfatality however she could give but a desperate shrug i see the colonel sympathetically mused that was a rumstart but his very response as she again flung up her arms seemed tomake her sense for a moment intolerable yes there i am iwas really at the bottom of it she declared i don t know whatpossessed me but i planned for him i goaded him on withwhich however the next moment she took herself up or rather i do know what possessed me for wasn t he beset withravening women right and left and didn t he quitepathetically appeal for protection didn t he quite charmingly show one how he needed and desired it maggie she thus lucidlycontinued couldn t with a new life of her own give herself upto doing for him in the future all she had done in the past tofencing him in to keeping him safe and keeping them off oneperceived this she went on out of the abundance of one saffection and one s sympathy it all blessedly came back toher when it wasn t all for the fiftieth time obscured in faceof the present facts by anxiety and compunction one was nodoubt a meddlesome fool one always is to think one seespeople s lives for them better than they see them for themselves but one s excuse here she insisted was that these peopleclearly didn t see them for themselves didn t see them at all it struck one for very pity that they were making a mess of suchcharming material that they were but wasting it and letting itgo they didn t know how to live and somehow one couldn t ifone took an interest in them at all simply stand and see it that s what i pay for and the poor woman in straightercommunion with her companion s intelligence at this moment sheappeared to feel than she had ever been before let him have thewhole of the burden of her consciousness i always pay for it sooner or later my sociable my damnable my unnecessaryinterest nothing of course would suit me but that it should fixitself also on charlotte charlotte who was hovering there on theedge of our lives when not beautifully and a triflemysteriously flitting across them and who was a piece of wasteand a piece of threatened failure just as for any possible goodto the world mr verver and maggie were it began to come overme in the watches of the night that charlotte was a person whocould keep off ravening women without being one herself either in the vulgar way of the others and that this service to mr verver would be a sweet employment for her future there wassomething of course that might have stopped me you know youknow what i mean it looks at me she veritably moaned out ofyour face but all i can say is that it didn t the reasonlargely being once i had fallen in love with the beautifulsymmetry of my plan that i seemed to feel sure maggie wouldaccept charlotte whereas i didn t quite make out either whatother woman or what other kind of woman one could think of heraccepting i see i see she had paused meeting all the while hislistening look and the fever of her retrospect had so risen withher talk that the desire was visibly strong in him to meet her on his side but with cooling breath one quite understands mydear it only however kept her there sombre i naturally see love what you understand which sits again perfectly in your eyes you see that i saw that maggie would accept her in helplessignorance yes dearest and the grimness of her drearinesssuddenly once more possessed her you ve only to tell me thatthat knowledge was my reason for what i did how when you do can i stand up to you you see she said with an ineffableheadshake that i don t stand up i m down down down shedeclared yet she as quickly added there s just one littlething that helps to save my life and she kept him waiting butan instant they might easily they would perhaps evencertainly have done something worse he thought worse than that charlotte ah don t tell me she cried that there could have beennothing worse there might as they were have been many things charlotte in her way is extraordinary he was almost simultaneous extraordinary she observes the forms said fanny assingham he hesitated with the prince for the prince and with the others she went on with mr verver wonderfully but above all with maggie and the forms she had to do even them justice are two thirds of conduct say he had married a woman who would have made a hash of them but he jerked back ah my dear i wouldn t say it for theworld say she none the less pursued he had married a woman theprince would really have cared for you mean then he doesn t care for charlotte this was still anew view to jump to and the colonel perceptibly wished to makesure of the necessity of the effort for that while he stared his wife allowed him time at the end of which she simply said no then what on earth are they up to still however she onlylooked at him so that standing there before her with his handsin his pockets he had time further to risk soothingly another question are the forms you speak of that aretwo thirds of conduct what will be keeping her now by yourhypothesis from coming home with him till morning yes absolutely their forms theirs maggie s and mr verver s those they impose on charlotte andthe prince those she developed that so perversely as isay have succeeded in setting themselves up as the right ones he considered but only now at last really to relapse into woe your perversity my dear is exactly what i don t understand the state of things existing hasn t grown like a field ofmushrooms in a night whatever they all round may be in fornow is at least the consequence of what they ve done are theymere helpless victims of fate well fanny at last had the courage of it yes they are to beso abjectly innocent that is to be victims of fate and charlotte and the prince are abjectly innocent it took her another minute but she rose to the full height yes that is they were as much so in their way as the others there were beautiful intentions all round the prince s andcharlotte s were beautiful of that i had my faith they were i d go to the stake otherwise she added i should have been awretch and i ve not been a wretch i ve only been a double dyeddonkey ah then he asked what does our muddle make them to havebeen well too much taken up with considering each other you maycall such a mistake as that by what ever name you please it atany rate means all round their case it illustrates themisfortune said mrs assingham gravely of being too toocharming this was another matter that took some following but the colonelagain did his best yes but to whom doesn t it rather dependon that to whom have the prince and charlotte then been toocharming to each other in the first place obviously and then both ofthem together to maggie to maggie he wonderingly echoed to maggie she was now crystalline by having accepted fromthe first so guilelessly yes so guilelessly themselves herguileless idea of still having her father of keeping him fast in her life then isn t one supposed in common humanity and if one hasn tquarrelled with him and one has the means and he on his side doesn t drink or kick up rows isn t one supposed to keep one saged parent in one s life certainly when there aren t particular reasons against it thatthere may be others than his getting drunk is exactly the moralof what is before us in the first place mr verver isn t aged the colonel just hung fire but it came then why the deuce doeshe oh poor dear man behave as if he were she took a moment to meet it how do you know how he behaves well my own love we see how charlotte does again at this she faltered but again she rose ah isn t my whole point thathe s charming to her doesn t it depend a bit on what she regards as charming she faced the question as if it were flippant then with aheadshake of dignity she brushed it away it s mr verver who sreally young it s charlotte who s really old and what i wassaying she added isn t affected you were saying he did her the justice that they re allguileless that they were guileless all at first quite extraordinarily it s what i mean by their failure to see that the more they tookfor granted they could work together the more they were reallyworking apart for i repeat fanny went on that i reallybelieve charlotte and the prince honestly to have made up theirminds originally that their very esteem for mr verver whichwas serious as well it might be would save them i see the colonel inclined himself and save him it comes to the same thing then save maggie that comes said mrs assingham to something a littledifferent for maggie has done the most he wondered what do you call the most well she did it originally she began the vicious circle forthat though you make round eyes at my associating her with vice is simply what it has been it s their mutualconsideration all round that has made it the bottomless gulf and they re really so embroiled but because in their way they ve been so improbably good in their way yes the colonel grinned which was above all maggie s way no flicker of his ribaldrywas anything to her now maggie had in the first place to makeup to her father for her having suffered herself to become poorlittle dear as she believed so intensely married then she hadto make up to her husband for taking so much of the time theymight otherwise have spent together to make this reparation tomr verver perfect and her way to do this precisely was byallowing the prince the use the enjoyment whatever you may callit of charlotte to cheer his path by instalments as it were in proportion as she herself making sure her father was allright might be missed from his side by so much at the sametime however mrs assingham further explained by so much asshe took her young stepmother for this purpose away from mr verver by just so much did this too strike her as somethingagain to be made up for it has saddled her you will easily see with a positively new obligation to her father an obligationcreated and aggravated by her unfortunate even if quite heroic little sense of justice she began with wanting to show him thathis marriage could never under whatever temptation of her ownbliss with the prince become for her a pretext for deserting orneglecting him then that in its order entailed her wanting toshow the prince that she recognised how the other desire thiswish to remain intensely the same passionate little daughtershe had always been involved in some degree and just for thepresent so to speak her neglecting and deserting him i quitehold fanny with characteristic amplitude parenthesised that aperson can mostly feel but one passion one tender passion thatis at a time only that doesn t hold good for our primary andinstinctive attachments the voice of blood such as one sfeeling for a parent or a brother those may be intense andyet not prevent other intensities as you will recognise mydear when you remember how i continued tout betement to adoremy mother whom you didn t adore for years after i had begun toadore you well maggie she kept it up is in the samesituation as i was plus complications from which i was thankheaven exempt plus the complication above all of not havingin the least begun with the sense for complications that i shouldhave had before she knew it at any rate her little scruplesand her little lucidities which were really so divinely blind her feverish little sense of justice as i say had brought thetwo others together as her grossest misconduct couldn t havedone and now she knows something or other has happened yethasn t heretofore known what she has only piled up her remedy poor child something that she has earnestly but confusedly seenas her necessary policy piled it on top of the policy on top ofthe remedy that she at first thought out for herself and thatwould really have needed since then so much modification heronly modification has been the growth of her necessity to preventher father s wondering if all in their life in common may be socertainly for the best she has now as never before to keep himunconscious that peculiar if he makes a point of it as theirsituation is there s anything in it all uncomfortable ordisagreeable anything morally the least out of the way she hasto keep touching it up to make it each day each month looknatural and normal to him so that god forgive me thecomparison she s like an old woman who has taken to painting and who has to lay it on thicker to carry it off with a greateraudacity with a greater impudence even the older she grows and fanny stood a moment captivated with the image she had thrownoff i like the idea of maggie audacious and impudent learningto be so to gloss things over she could she even will yet ibelieve learn it for that sacred purpose consummately diabolically for from the moment the dear man should see it sall rouge she paused staring at the vision it imparted itself even to bob then the fun would begin as itbut made her look at him hard however he amended the form ofhis inquiry you mean that in that case she will charmingcreature be lost she was silent a moment more as i ve told you before she won tbe lost if her father s saved she ll see that as salvationenough the colonel took it in then she s a little heroine rather she s a little heroine but it s his innocence aboveall mrs assingham added that will pull them through her companion at this focussed again mr verver s innocence it s awfully quaint of course it s awfully quaint that it s awfully quaint thatthe pair are awfully quaint quaint with all our dear oldquaintness by which i don t mean yours and mine but that of myown sweet countrypeople from whom i ve so deplorablydegenerated that mrs assingham declared was originally thehead and front of their appeal to me and of my interest inthem and of course i shall feel them quainter still she ratherruefully subjoined before they ve done with me this might be but it wasn t what most stood in the colonel sway you believe so in mr verver s innocence after two years ofcharlotte she stared but the whole point is just that two years ofcharlotte are what he hasn t really or what you may callundividedly had any more than maggie by your theory eh has really orundividedly had four of the prince it takes all she hasn thad the colonel conceded to account for the innocence that inher too so leaves us in admiration so far as it might be ribald again she let this pass it takes agreat many things to account for maggie what is definite at allevents is that strange though this be her effort for herfather has up to now sufficiently succeeded she has made him she makes him accept the tolerably obvious oddity of theirrelation all round for part of the game behind her there protected and amused and as it were exquisitely humbugged theprincipino in whom he delights always aiding he has safely andserenely enough suffered the conditions of his life to pass forthose he had sublimely projected he hadn t worked them out indetail any more than i had heaven pity me and the queernesshas been exactly in the detail this for him is what it wasto have married charlotte and they both she neatly wound up help both i mean that if maggie always in the breach makes it seem tohim all so flourishingly to fit charlotte does her part notless and her part is very large charlotte fanny declared works like a horse so there it all was and her husband looked at her a minuteacross it and what does the prince work like she fixed him in return like a prince whereupon breakingshort off to ascend to her room she presented her highly decorated back in which in odd places controlling thecomplications of its aspect the ruby or the garnet theturquoise and the topaz gleamed like faint symbols of the witthat pinned together the satin patches of her argument he watched her as if she left him positively under the impressionof her mastery of her subject yes as if the real upshot of thedrama before them was but that he had when it came to the tightplaces of life as life had shrunk for him now the most luminousof wives he turned off in this view of her majestic retreat the comparatively faint little electric lamp which had presidedover their talk then he went up as immediately behind her as thebillows of her amber train allowed making out how all theclearness they had conquered was even for herself a relief howat last the sense of the amplitude of her exposition sustainedand floated her joining her however on the landing above where she had already touched a metallic point into light hefound she had done perhaps even more to create than to extinguishin him the germ of a curiosity he held her a minute longer there was another plum in the pie what did you mean someminutes ago by his not caring for charlotte the prince s by his not really caring she recalled after alittle benevolently enough i mean that men don t when it hasall been too easy that s how in nine cases out of ten a womanis treated who has risked her life you asked me just now how heworks she added but you might better perhaps have asked mehow he plays well he made it up like a prince like a prince he is profoundly a prince for that she saidwith expression he s beautifully a case they re far rarer even in the highest circles than they pretend to be andthat s what makes so much of his value he s perhaps one of thevery last the last of the real ones so it is we must take him we must take him all round the colonel considered and how must charlotte if anythinghappens take him the question held her a minute and while she waited with hereyes on him she put out a grasping hand to his arm in the fleshof which he felt her answer distinctly enough registered thusshe gave him standing off a little the firmest longest deepest injunction he had ever received from her nothing in spite of everything will happen nothing has happened nothing is happening he looked a trifle disappointed i see for us for us for whom else and he was to feel indeed how she wishedhim to understand it we know nothing on earth it was anundertaking he must sign so he wrote as it were his name we know nothing on earth itwas like the soldiers watchword at night we re as innocent she went on in the same way as babes why not rather say he asked as innocent as they themselvesare oh for the best of reasons because we re much more so he wondered but how can we be more for them oh easily we can be anything absolute idiots then absolute idiots and oh fanny breathed the way it will restus well he looked as if there were something in that but won tthey know we re not she barely hesitated charlotte and the prince think we are which is so much gained mr verver believes in ourintelligence but he doesn t matter and maggie doesn t she know that we see before our noses yes this indeed took longer oh so far as she may guess it she ll give no sign so it comesto the same thing he raised his eyebrows comes to our not being able to helpher that s the way we shall help her by looking like fools she threw up her hands she only wants herself to look like abigger so there we are with which she brushed it away hisconformity was promised something however still held her itbroke to her own vision as a last wave of clearness moreover now she said i see i mean she added what youwere asking me how i knew to day in eaton square that maggie sawake and she had indeed visibly got it it was by seeing themtogether seeing her with her father he fell behind again but you veseen her often enough before never with my present eyes for nothing like such a test thatof this length of the others absence together has hithertooccurred possibly but if she and mr verver insisted upon it why is it such a test because it has become one without theirintending it it has spoiled so to speak on their hands it has soured eh the colonel said the word s horrible say rather it has changed perhaps fanny went on she did wish to see how much she can bear inthat case she has seen only it was she alone who about thevisit insisted her father insists on nothing and she watcheshim do it her husband looked impressed watches him for the first faint sign i mean of his noticing it doesn t asi tell you come but she s there for it to see and i felt shecontinued how she s there i caught her as it were in thefact she couldn t keep it from me though she left her post onpurpose came home with me to throw dust in my eyes i took itall her dust but it was what showed me with which supremelucidity she reached the door of her room luckily it showed mealso how she has succeeded nothing from him has come you re so awfully sure sure nothing will good night she said she ll die first the golden bowl volume iibook second the princesspart fourthxxvit was not till many days had passed that the princess began toaccept the idea of having done a little something she was notalways doing or indeed that of having listened to any inwardvoice that spoke in a new tone yet these instinctivepostponements of reflection were the fruit positively ofrecognitions and perceptions already active of the sense aboveall that she had made at a particular hour made by the meretouch of her hand a difference in the situation so long presentto her as practically unattackable this situation had beenoccupying for months and months the very centre of the gardenof her life but it had reared itself there like some strange tall tower of ivory or perhaps rather some wonderful beautiful but outlandish pagoda a structure plated with hard brightporcelain coloured and figured and adorned at the overhangingeaves with silver bells that tinkled ever so charmingly whenstirred by chance airs she had walked round and round it thatwas what she felt she had carried on her existence in the spaceleft her for circulation a space that sometimes seemed ample andsometimes narrow looking up all the while at the fairstructure that spread itself so amply and rose so high but neverquite making out as yet where she might have entered had shewished she had not wished till now such was the odd case andwhat was doubtless equally odd besides was that though herraised eyes seemed to distinguish places that must serve fromwithin and especially far aloft as apertures and outlooks nodoor appeared to give access from her convenient garden level the great decorated surface had remained consistentlyimpenetrable and inscrutable at present however to herconsidering mind it was as if she had ceased merely to circleand to scan the elevation ceased so vaguely so quite helplesslyto stare and wonder she had caught herself distinctly in the actof pausing then in that of lingering and finally in that ofstepping unprecedentedly near the thing might have been by thedistance at which it kept her a mahometan mosque with which nobase heretic could take a liberty there so hung about it thevision of one s putting off one s shoes to enter and even verily of one s paying with one s life if found there as aninterloper she had not certainly arrived at the conception ofpaying with her life for anything she might do but it wasnevertheless quite as if she had sounded with a tap or two one ofthe rare porcelain plates she had knocked in short though shecould scarce have said whether for admission or for what she hadapplied her hand to a cool smooth spot and had waited to see whatwould happen something had happened it was as if a sound ather touch after a little had come back to her from within asound sufficiently suggesting that her approach had been noted if this image however may represent our young woman sconsciousness of a recent change in her life a change now but afew days old it must at the same time be observed that she bothsought and found in renewed circulation as i have called it ameasure of relief from the idea of having perhaps to answer forwhat she had done the pagoda in her blooming garden figured thearrangement how otherwise was it to be named by which sostrikingly she had been able to marry without breaking as sheliked to put it with the past she had surrendered herself toher husband without the shadow of a reserve or a condition andyet she had not all the while given up her father the leastlittle inch she had compassed the high city of seeing the twomen beautifully take to each other and nothing in her marriagehad marked it as more happy than this fact of its havingpractically given the elder the lonelier a new friend what hadmoreover all the while enriched the whole aspect of success wasthat the latter s marriage had been no more meassurably paid forthan her own his having taken the same great step in the samefree way had not in the least involved the relegation of hisdaughter that it was remarkable they should have been able atonce so to separate and so to keep together had never for amoment from however far back been equivocal to her that it wasremarkable had in fact quite counted at first and always andfor each of them equally as part of their inspiration and theirsupport there were plenty of singular things they were notenamoured of flights of brilliancy of audacity of originality that speaking at least for the dear man and herself were not atall in their line but they liked to think they had given theirlife this unusual extension and this liberal form which manyfamilies many couples and still more many pairs of couples would not have found workable that last truth had beendistinctly brought home to them by the bright testimony thequite explicit envy of most of their friends who had remarkedto them again and again that they must on all the showing tokeep on such terms be people of the highest amiability equallyincluding in the praise of course amerigo and charlotte it hadgiven them pleasure as how should it not to find themselvesshed such a glamour it had certainly that is given pleasure toher father and herself both of them distinguishably of a natureso slow to presume that they would scarce have been sure of theirtriumph without this pretty reflection of it so it was thattheir felicity had fructified so it was that the ivory tower visible and admirable doubtless from any point of the socialfield had risen stage by stage maggie s actual reluctance toask herself with proportionate sharpness why she had ceased totake comfort in the sight of it represented accordingly a lapsefrom that ideal consistency on which her moral comfort almost atany time depended to remain consistent she had always beencapable of cutting down more or less her prior term moving for the first time in her life as in the darkening shadowof a false position she reflected that she should either nothave ceased to be right that is to be confident or haverecognised that she was wrong though she tried to deal withherself for a space only as a silken coated spaniel who hasscrambled out of a pond and who rattles the water from his ears her shake of her head again and again as she went was much ofthat order and she had the resource to which save for the rudeequivalent of his generalising bark the spaniel would have beena stranger of humming to herself hard as a sign that nothing hadhappened to her she had not so to speak fallen in she had hadno accident and had not got wet this at any rate was herpretension until after she began a little to wonder if shemightn t with or without exposure have taken cold she could atall events remember no time at which she had felt so excited andcertainly none which was another special point that so broughtwith it as well the necessity for concealing excitement thisbirth of a new eagerness became a high pastime in her view precisely by reason of the ingenuity required for keeping thething born out of sight the ingenuity was thus a private andabsorbing exercise in the light of which might i so farmultiply my metaphors i should compare her to the frightened butclinging young mother of an unlawful child the idea that hadpossession of her would be by our new analogy the proof of hermisadventure but likewise all the while only another sign of arelation that was more to her than anything on earth she hadlived long enough to make out for herself that any deep seatedpassion has its pangs as well as its joys and that we are madeby its aches and its anxieties most richly conscious of it shehad never doubted of the force of the feeling that bound her toher husband but to become aware almost suddenly that it hadbegun to vibrate with a violence that had some of the effect of astrain would rightly looked at after all but show that she was like thousands of women every day acting up to the fullprivilege of passion why in the world shouldn t she with everyright if on consideration she saw no good reason against it the best reason against it would have been the possibility ofsome consequence disagreeable or inconvenient to others especially to such others as had never incommoded her by theegotism of their passions but if once that danger were dulyguarded against the fulness of one s measure amounted to no morethan the equal use of one s faculties or the proper playing ofone s part it had come to the princess obscurely at first butlittle by little more conceivably that her faculties had not fora good while been concomitantly used the case resembled in amanner that of her once loved dancing a matter of rememberedsteps that had grown vague from her ceasing to go to balls shewould go to balls again that seemed freely even crudely stated the remedy she would take out of the deep receptacles inwhich she had laid them away the various ornamentscongruous with the greater occasions and of which her store sheliked to think was none of the smallest she would have beeneasily to be figured for us at this occupation dipping at offmoments and quiet hours in snatched visits and by draughtycandle light into her rich collections and seeing her jewelsagain a little shyly but all unmistakably glow that in factmay pass as the very picture of her semi smothered agitation ofthe diversion she to some extent successfully found in referringher crisis so far as was possible to the mere working of herown needs it must be added however that she would have been at a loss todetermine and certainly at first to which order that ofself control or that of large expression the step she had takenthe afternoon of her husband s return from matcham with hiscompanion properly belonged for it had been a step distinctly on maggie s part her deciding to do something just then andthere which would strike amerigo as unusual and this eventhough her departure from custom had merely consisted in her soarranging that he wouldn t find her as he would definitelyexpect to do in eaton square he would have strangely enough as might seem to him to come back home for it and there get theimpression of her rather pointedly or at least all impatientlyand independently awaiting him these were small variations andmild manoeuvres but they went accompanied on maggie s part aswe have mentioned with an infinite sense of intention herwatching by his fireside for her husband s return from an absencemight superficially have presented itself as the most natural actin the world and the only one into the bargain on which hewould positively have reckoned it fell by this circumstance intothe order of plain matters and yet the very aspect by which itwas in the event handed over to her brooding fancy was the factthat she had done with it all she had designed she had put herthought to the proof and the proof had shown its edge this waswhat was before her that she was no longer playing with bluntand idle tools with weapons that didn t cut there passed acrossher vision ten times a day the gleam of a bare blade and at thisit was that she most shut her eyes most knew the impulse tocheat herself with motion and sound she had merely driven on acertain wednesday to portland place instead of remaining ineaton square and she privately repeated it again and again there had appeared beforehand no reason why she should have seenthe mantle of history flung by a single sharp sweep over socommonplace a deed that all the same was what had happened ithad been bitten into her mind all in an hour that nothing shehad ever done would hereafter in some way yet to be determined so count for her perhaps not even what she had done inaccepting in their old golden rome amerigo s proposal ofmarriage and yet by her little crouching posture there that ofa timid tigress she had meant nothing recklessly ultimate nothing clumsily fundamental so that she called it names theinvidious the grotesque attitude holding it up to her ownridicule reducing so far as she could the portee of what hadfollowed it she had but wanted to get nearer nearer tosomething indeed that she couldn t that she wouldn t even toherself describe and the degree of this achieved nearness waswhat had been in advance incalculable her actual multiplicationof distractions and suppressions whatever it did for her failedto prevent her living over again any chosen minute for she couldchoose them she could fix them of the freshness of relationproduced by her having administered to her husband the firstsurprise to which she had ever treated him it had been a poorthing but it had been all her own and the whole passage wasbackwardly there a great picture hung on the wall of her dailylife for her to make what she would of it fell for retrospect into a succession of moments that werewatchable still almost in the manner of the different thingsdone during a scene on the stage some scene so acted as to haveleft a great impression on the tenant of one of the stalls several of these moments stood out beyond the others and thoseshe could feel again most count again like the firm pearls on astring had belonged more particularly to the lapse of timebefore dinner dinner which had been so late quite at nineo clock that evening thanks to the final lateness of amerigo sown advent these were parts of the experience though in factthere had been a good many of them between which her impressioncould continue sharply to discriminate before the subsequentpassages much later on it was to be said the flame of memoryturned to an equalising glow that of a lamp in some side chapelin which incense was thick the great moment at any rate forconscious repossession was doubtless the first the strangelittle timed silence which she had fully gauged on the spot asaltogether beyond her own intention but which for just howlong should she ever really know for just how long she coulddo nothing to break she was in the smaller drawing room inwhich she always sat and she had by calculation dressed fordinner on finally coming in it was a wonder how many things shehad calculated in respect to this small incident a matter forthe importance of which she had so quite indefinite a measure hewould be late he would be very late that was the one certaintythat seemed to look her in the face there was still also thepossibility that if he drove with charlotte straight to eatonsquare he might think it best to remain there even on learningshe had come away she had left no message for him on any suchchance this was another of her small shades of decision thoughthe effect of it might be to keep him still longer absent hemight suppose she would already have dined he might stay withall he would have to tell just on purpose to be nice to herfather she had known him to stretch the point to thesebeautiful ends far beyond that he had more than once stretchedit to the sacrifice of the opportunity of dressing if she herself had now avoided any such sacrifice and had madeherself during the time at her disposal quite inordinatelyfresh and quite positively smart this had probably added whileshe waited and waited to that very tension of spirit in whichshe was afterwards to find the image of her having crouched shedid her best quite intensely by herself to banish any suchappearance she couldn t help it if she couldn t read her palenovel ah that par exemple was beyond her but she could atleast sit by the lamp with the book sit there with her newestfrock worn for the first time sticking out all round her quite stiff and grand even perhaps a little too stiff and toogrand for a familiar and domestic frock yet marked none theless this time she ventured to hope by incontestable intrinsicmerit she had glanced repeatedly at the clock but she hadrefused herself the weak indulgence of walking up and down though the act of doing so she knew would make her feel on thepolished floor with the rustle and the hang still morebeautifully bedecked the difficulty was that it would also makeher feel herself still more sharply in a state which was exactlywhat she proposed not to do the only drops of her anxiety hadbeen when her thought strayed complacently with her eyes to thefront of her gown which was in a manner a refuge a beguilement especially when she was able to fix it long enough to wonder ifit would at last really satisfy charlotte she had ever been inrespect to her clothes rather timorous and uncertain for thelast year above all she had lived in the light of charlotte spossible and rather inscrutable judgment of them charlotte s ownwere simply the most charming and interesting that any woman hadever put on there was a kind of poetic justice in her being atlast able in this particular thanks to means thanks quite toomnipotence freely to exercise her genius but maggie would havedescribed herself as in these connections constantly andintimately torn conscious on one side of the impossibility ofcopying her companion and conscious on the other of theimpossibility of sounding her independently to the bottom yes it was one of the things she should go down to her grave withouthaving known how charlotte after all had been said reallythought her stepdaughter looked under any supposedly ingeniouspersonal experiment she had always been lovely about thestepdaughter s material braveries had done for her the verybest with them but there had ever fitfully danced at the back ofmaggie s head the suspicion that these expressions were mercies not judgments embodying no absolute but only a relative frankness hadn t charlotte with so perfect a critical vision if the truth were known given her up as hopeless hopeless by aserious standard and thereby invented for her a different andinferior one in which as the only thing to be done shepatiently and soothingly abetted her hadn t she in other words assented in secret despair perhaps even in secret irritation toher being ridiculous so that the best now possible was towonder once in a great while whether one mightn t give her thesurprise of something a little less out of the true note thanusual something of this kind was the question that maggie whilethe absentees still delayed asked of the appearance she wasendeavouring to present but with the result repeatedly again that it only went and lost itself in the thick air that had begunmore and more to hang for our young woman over heraccumulations of the unanswered they were there theseaccumulations they were like a roomful of confused objects never as yet sorted which for some time now she had beenpassing and re passing along the corridor of her life shepassed it when she could without opening the door then onoccasion she turned the key to throw in a fresh contribution soit was that she had been getting things out of the way theyrejoined the rest of the confusion it was as if they found theirplace by some instinct of affinity in the heap they knew inshort where to go and when she at present by a mental act once more pushed the door open she had practically a sense ofmethod and experience what she should never know aboutcharlotte s thought she tossed that in it would find itself incompany and she might at last have been standing there longenough to see it fall into its corner the sight moreover woulddoubtless have made her stare had her attention been more free the sight of the mass of vain things congruous incongruous that awaited every addition it made her in fact with a vaguegasp turn away and what had further determined this was thefinal sharp extinction of the inward scene by the outward thequite different door had opened and her husband was there it had been as strange as she could consent afterwards to thinkit it had been essentially what had made the abrupt bend inher life he had come back had followed her from the otherhouse visibly uncertain this was written in the face he for thefirst minute showed her it had been written only for thoseseconds and it had appeared to go quickly after theybegan to talk but while it lasted it had been written large and though she didn t quite know what she had expected of him she felt she hadn t expected the least shade of embarrassment what had made the embarrassment she called it embarrassment soas to be able to assure herself she put it at the very worst what had made the particular look was his thus distinguishablywishing to see how he should find her why first that had lateron kept coming to her the question dangled there as if it werethe key to everything with the sense of it on the spot she hadfelt overwhelmingly that she was significant that so she mustinstantly strike him and that this had a kind of violence beyondwhat she had intended it was in fact even at the moment notabsent from her view that he might easily have made an abjectfool of her at least for the time she had indeed for just tenseconds been afraid of some such turn the uncertainty in hisface had become so the next thing an uncertainty in the veryair three words of impatience the least bit loud some outbreakof what in the world are you up to and what do you mean anynote of that sort would instantly have brought her low and thisall the more that heaven knew she hadn t in any manner designedto be high it was such a trifle her small breach with custom or at any rate with his natural presumption that all magnitudeof wonder had already had before one could deprecate the shadowof it the effect of a complication it had made for him somedifference that she couldn t measure this meeting him at homeand alone instead of elsewhere and with others and backand back it kept coming to her that the blankness he showed herbefore he was able to see might should she choose to insist onit have a meaning have as who should say an historic value beyond the importance of momentary expressions in general shehad naturally had on the spot no ready notion of what he mightwant to see it was enough for a ready notion not to speak of abeating heart that he did see that he saw his wife in her owndrawing room at the hour when she would most properly be there he hadn t in any way challenged her it was true and afterthose instants during which she now believed him to have beenharbouring the impression of something unusually prepared andpointed in her attitude and array he had advanced upon hersmiling and smiling and thus without hesitation at the last had taken her into his arms the hesitation had been at thefirst and she at present saw that he had surmounted it withouther help she had given him no help for if on the one hand shecouldn t speak for hesitation so on the other and especially ashe didn t ask her she couldn t explain why she was agitated shehad known it all the while down to her toes known it in hispresence with fresh intensity and if he had uttered but aquestion it would have pressed in her the spring of recklessness it had been strange that the most natural thing of all to say tohim should have had that appearance but she was more than everconscious that any appearance she had would come round more orless straight to her father whose life was now so quiet on thebasis accepted for it that any alteration of his consciousnesseven in the possible sense of enlivenment would make theirprecious equilibrium waver that was at the bottom of her mind that their equilibrium was everything and that it waspractically precarious a matter of a hair s breadth for the lossof the balance it was the equilibrium or at all events herconscious fear about it that had brought her heart into hermouth and the same fear was on either side in the silent lookshe and amerigo had exchanged the happy balance that demandedthis amount of consideration was truly thus as by its ownconfession a delicate matter but that her husband had also hishabit of anxiety and his general caution only brought them afterall more closely together it would have been most beautifully therefore in the name of the equilibrium and in that of her joyat their feeling so exactly the same about it that she mighthave spoken if she had permitted the truth on the subject of herbehaviour to ring out on the subject of that poor littlebehaviour which was for the moment so very limited a case ofeccentricity why why have i made this evening such a point of our not alldining together well because i ve all day been so wanting youalone that i finally couldn t bear it and that there didn t seemany great reason why i should try to that came to me funny asit may at first sound with all the things we ve so wonderfullygot into the way of bearing for each other you ve seemed theselast days i don t know what more absent than ever before tooabsent for us merely to go on so it s all very well and iperfectly see how beautiful it is all round but there comes aday when something snaps when the full cup filled to the verybrim begins to flow over that s what has happened to my need ofyou the cup all day has been too full to carry so here i amwith it spilling it over you and just for the reason that isthe reason of my life after all i ve scarcely to explain thati m as much in love with you now as the first hour except thatthere are some hours which i know when they come because theyalmost frighten me that show me i m even more so they come ofthemselves and ah they ve been coming after all afterall some such words as those were what didn t ring out yetit was as if even the unuttered sound had been quenched here inits own quaver it was where utterance would have broken down byits very weight if he had let it get so far without thatextremity at the end of a moment he had taken in what he neededto take that his wife was testifying that she adored and missedand desired him after all after all since she put it so shewas right that was what he had to respond to that was what from the moment that as has been said he saw he had to treatas the most pertinent thing possible he held her close and long in expression of their personal reunion this obviously was oneway of doing so he rubbed his cheek tenderly and with a deepvague murmur against her face that side of her face she was notpressing to his breast that was not less obviously anotherway and there were ways enough in short for his extemporisedease for the good humour she was afterwards to find herselfthinking of as his infinite tact this last was partly no doubt because the question of tact might be felt as having come up atthe end of a quarter of an hour during which he had liberallytalked and she had genially questioned he had told her of hisday the happy thought of his roundabout journey with charlotte all their cathedral hunting adventure and how it had turned outrather more of an affair than they expected the moral of it was at any rate that he was tired verily and must have a bath anddress to which end she would kindly excuse him for the shortesttime possible she was to remember afterwards something that hadpassed between them on this how he had looked for her duringan instant at the door before going out how he had met herasking him in hesitation first then quickly in decision whether she couldn t help him by going up with him he hadperhaps also for a moment hesitated but he had declined heroffer and she was to preserve as i say the memory of the smilewith which he had opined that at that rate they wouldn t dinetill ten o clock and that he should go straighter and fasteralone such things as i say were to come back to her theyplayed through her full after sense like lights on the wholeimpression the subsequent parts of the experience were not tohave blurred their distinctness one of these subsequent parts the first had been the not inconsiderable length to her laterand more analytic consciousness of this second wait for herhusband s reappearance she might certainly with the best willin the world had she gone up with him have been more in his waythan not since people could really almost always hurry betterwithout help than with it still she could actually hardly havemade him take more time than he struck her taking though it mustindeed be added that there was now in this much thinking littleperson s state of mind no mere crudity of impatience somethinghad happened rapidly with the beautiful sight of him and withthe drop of her fear of having annoyed him by making him go toand fro subsidence of the fearsome for maggie s spirit wasalways at first positive emergence of the sweet and it waslong since anything had been so sweet to her as the particularquality suddenly given by her present emotion to the sense ofpossession xxviamerigo was away from her again as she sat there as she walkedthere without him for she had with the difference of hispresence in the house ceased to keep herself from moving about but the hour was filled nevertheless with the effect of hisnearness and above all with the effect strange in an intimacyso established of an almost renewed vision of the facts of hisaspect she had seen him last but five days since yet he hadstood there before her as if restored from some far country somelong voyage some combination of dangers or fatigues thisunquenchable variety in his appeal to her interest what did itmean but that reduced to the flatness of mere statement she wasmarried by good fortune to an altogether dazzling person thatwas an old old story but the truth of it shone out to her likethe beauty of some family picture some mellow portrait of anancestor that she might have been looking at almost insurprise after a long intermission the dazzling person wasupstairs and she was down and there were moreover the otherfacts of the selection and decision that this demonstration ofher own had required and of the constant care that theequilibrium involved but she had all the same never felt soabsorbingly married so abjectly conscious of a master of herfate he could do what he would with her in fact what wasactually happening was that he was actually doing it what hewould what he really would only that quantity itself escapedperhaps in the brightness of the high harmony familiar namingand discussing it was enough of a recognition for her that whatever the thing he might desire he would always absolutelybring it off she knew at this moment without a question withthe fullest surrender how he had brought off in her by scarcemore than a single allusion a perfect flutter of tenderness ifhe had come back tired tired from his long day the exertion hadbeen literally in her service and her father s they two hadsat at home at peace the principino between them thecomplications of life kept down the bores sifted out the largeease of the home preserved because of the way the others heldthe field and braved the weather amerigo never complained anymore than for that matter charlotte did but she seemed to seeto night as she had never yet quite done that their business ofsocial representation conceived as they conceived it beyond anyconception of her own and conscientiously carried out was anaffair of living always in harness she remembered fannyassingham s old judgment that friend s description of her fatherand herself as not living at all as not knowing what to do orwhat might be done for them and there came back to her with itan echo of the long talk they had had together one september dayat fawns under the trees when she put before him this dictum offanny s that occasion might have counted for them she had already oftenmade the reflection as the first step in an existence moreintelligently arranged it had been an hour from which the chainof causes and consequences was definitely traceable so manythings and at the head of the list her father s marriage havingappeared to her to flow from charlotte s visit to fawns and thatevent itself having flowed from the memorable talk but whatperhaps most came out in the light of these concatenations wasthat it had been for all the world as if charlotte had been had in as the servants always said of extra help because theyhad thus suffered it to be pointed out to them that if theirfamily coach lumbered and stuck the fault was in its lacking itscomplement of wheels having but three as they might say it hadwanted another and what had charlotte done from the first butbegin to act on the spot and ever so smoothly and beautifully as a fourth nothing had been immediately more manifest thanthe greater grace of the movement of the vehicle as to which for the completeness of her image maggie was now supremely tofeel how every strain had been lightened for herself so far asshe was one of the wheels she had but to keep in her place sincethe work was done for her she felt no weight and it wasn t toomuch to acknowledge that she had scarce to turn round she had along pause before the fire during which she might have beenfixing with intensity her projected vision have been consciouseven of its taking an absurd fantastic shape she might havebeen watching the family coach pass and noting that somehow amerigo and charlotte were pulling it while she and her fatherwere not so much as pushing they were seated inside together dandling the principino and holding him up to the windows to seeand be seen like an infant positively royal so that theexertion was all with the others maggie found in this image arepeated challenge again and yet again she paused before thefire after which each time in the manner of one for whom astrong light has suddenly broken she gave herself to liveliermovement she had seen herself at last in the picture she wasstudying suddenly jump from the coach whereupon frankly withthe wonder of the sight her eyes opened wider and her heartstood still for a moment she looked at the person so acting asif this person were somebody else waiting with intensity to seewhat would follow the person had taken a decision which wasevidently because an impulse long gathering had at last felt asharpest pressure only how was the decision to be applied what in particular would the figure in the picture do shelooked about her from the middle of the room under the force ofthis question as if there exactly were the field of actioninvolved then as the door opened again she recognised whatever the action the form at any rate of a firstopportunity her husband had reappeared he stood before herrefreshed almost radiant quite reassuring dressed anointed fragrant ready above all for his dinner he smiled at her overthe end of their delay it was as if her opportunity had dependedon his look and now she saw that it was good there was still for the instant something in suspense but it passed morequickly than on his previous entrance he was already holding outhis arms it was for hours and hours later on as if she hadsomehow been lifted aloft were floated and carried on some warmhigh tide beneath which stumbling blocks had sunk out of sight this came from her being again for the time in the enjoyment ofconfidence from her knowing as she believed what to do allthe next day and all the next she appeared to herself to knowit she had a plan and she rejoiced in her plan this consistedof the light that suddenly breaking into her restless reverie had marked the climax of that vigil it had come to her as aquestion what if i ve abandoned them you know what if i veaccepted too passively the funny form of our life there wouldbe a process of her own by which she might do differently inrespect to amerigo and charlotte a process quite independent ofany process of theirs such a solution had but to rise before herto affect her to charm her with its simplicity an advantageoussimplicity she had been stupid for so long not to have beenstruck by and the simplicity meanwhile seemed proved by thesuccess that had already begun to attend her she had only hadherself to do something to see how immediately it answered thisconsciousness of its having answered with her husband was theuplifting sustaining wave he had met her she so put it toherself met her with an effect of generosity and of gaiety inespecial on his coming back to her ready for dinner which shewore in her breast as the token of an escape for them both fromsomething not quite definite but clearly much less good evenat that moment in fact her plan had begun to work she hadbeen when he brightly reappeared in the act of plucking it outof the heart of her earnestness plucking it in the garden ofthought as if it had been some full blown flower that she couldpresent to him on the spot well it was the flower ofparticipation and as that then and there she held it out tohim putting straightway into execution the idea so needlessly so absurdly obscured of her sharing with him whatever theenjoyment the interest the experience might be and sharingalso for that matter with charlotte she had thrown herself at dinner into every feature of therecent adventure of the companions letting him see withoutreserve that she wished to hear everything about it and makingcharlotte in particular charlotte s judgment of matcham charlotte s aspect her success there her effect traceablyproduced her clothes inimitably worn her cleverness gracefullydisplayed her social utility in fine brilliantly exemplified the subject of endless inquiry maggie s inquiry was mostempathetic moreover for the whole happy thought of thecathedral hunt which she was so glad they had entertained andas to the pleasant results of which down to the cold beef andbread and cheese the queer old smell and the dirty table clothat the inn amerigo was good humouredly responsive he had lookedat her across the table more than once as if touched by thehumility of this welcome offered to impressions at second hand the amusements the large freedoms only of others as ifrecognising in it something fairly exquisite and at the end while they were alone before she had rung for a servant he hadrenewed again his condonation of the little irregularity such asit was on which she had ventured they had risen together tocome upstairs he had been talking at the last about some of thepeople at the very last of all about lady castledean and mr blint after which she had once more broken ground on the matterof the type of gloucester it brought her as he came round thetable to join her yet another of his kind conscious stares oneof the looks visibly beguiled but at the same time notinvisibly puzzled with which he had already shown his sense ofthis charming grace of her curiosity it was as if he might for amoment be going to say you needn t pretend dearest quite sohard needn t think it necessary to care quite so much it wasas if he stood there before her with some such easy intelligence some such intimate reassurance on his lips her answer wouldhave been all ready that she wasn t in the least pretending andshe looked up at him while he took her hand with themaintenance the real persistence of her lucid little planin her eyes she wanted him to understand from that very momentthat she was going to be with him again quite with them together as she doubtless hadn t been since the funny changes that was really all one could call them into which theyhad each as for the sake of the others too easily and tooobligingly slipped they had taken too much for granted thattheir life together required as people in london said a special form which was very well so long as the form was kept only forthe outside world and was made no more of among themselves thanthe pretty mould of an iced pudding or something of that sort into which to help yourself you didn t hesitate to break withthe spoon so much as that she would with an opening haveallowed herself furthermore to observe she wanted him tounderstand how her scheme embraced charlotte too so that if hehad but uttered the acknowledgment she judged him on the point ofmaking the acknowledgment of his catching at her brave littleidea for their case she would have found herself as distinctly voluble almost to eloquence what befell however was that even while she thus waited shefelt herself present at a process taking place rather deeperwithin him than the occasion on the whole appeared to require a process of weighing something in the balance of considering deciding dismissing he had guessed that she was there with anidea there in fact by reason of her idea only this oddlyenough was what at the last stayed his words she was helped tothese perceptions by his now looking at her still harder than hehad yet done which really brought it to the turn of a hair forher that she didn t make sure his notion of her idea was theright one it was the turn of a hair because he had possessionof her hands and was bending toward her ever so kindly as if tosee to understand more or possibly give more she didn t knowwhich and that had the effect of simply putting her as shewould have said in his power she gave up let her idea go leteverything go her one consciousness was that he was taking heragain into his arms it was not till afterwards that shediscriminated as to this felt how the act operated with himinstead of the words he hadn t uttered operated in his view asprobably better than any words as always better in fact at anytime than anything her acceptance of it her response to it inevitable foredoomed came back to her later on as a virtualassent to the assumption he had thus made that there was reallynothing such a demonstration didn t anticipate and didn t disposeof and that the spring acting within herself moreover might wellhave been beyond any other the impulse legitimately to provokeit it made for any issue the third time since his return thathe had drawn her to his breast and at present holding her tohis side as they left the room he kept her close for theirmoving into the hall and across it kept her for their slowreturn together to the apartments above he had been right overwhelmingly right as to the felicity of his tenderness andthe degree of her sensibility but even while she felt thesethings sweep all others away she tasted of a sort of terror ofthe weakness they produced in her it was still for her thatshe had positively something to do and that she mustn t be weakfor this must much rather be strong for many hours after nonethe less she remained weak if weak it was though holding fastindeed to the theory of her success since her agitated overturehad been after all so unmistakably met she recovered soon enough on the whole the sense that this lefther charlotte always to deal with charlotte who at any rate however she might meet overtures must meet them at the worst more or less differently of that inevitability of such otherranges of response as were open to charlotte maggie took themeasure in approaching her on the morrow of her return frommatcham with the same show of desire to hear all her story shewanted the whole picture from her as she had wanted it from hercompanion and promptly in eaton square whither without theprince she repaired almost ostentatiously for the purpose this purpose only she brought her repeatedly back to thesubject both in her husband s presence and during several scrapsof independent colloquy before her father instinctively maggietook the ground that his wish for interesting echoes would be notless than her own allowing that is for everything his wifewould already have had to tell him for such passages betweenthem as might have occurred since the evening before joiningthem after luncheon reaching them in her desire to proceed withthe application of her idea before they had quitted thebreakfast room the scene of their mid day meal she referred inher parent s presence to what she might have lost by delay andexpressed the hope that there would be an anecdote or two leftfor her to pick up charlotte was dressed to go out and herhusband it appeared rather positively prepared not to he hadleft the table but was seated near the fire with two or three ofthe morning papers and the residuum of the second and third postson a stand beside him more even than the usual extravagance asmaggie s glance made out of circulars catalogues advertisements announcements of sales foreign envelopes andforeign handwritings that were as unmistakable as foreignclothes charlotte at the window looking into the side streetthat abutted on the square might have been watching for theirvisitor s advent before withdrawing and in the light strangeand coloured like that of a painted picture which fixed theimpression for her objects took on values not hitherto so fullyshown it was the effect of her quickened sensibility she knewherself again in presence of a problem in need of a solution forwhich she must intensely work that consciousness lately born inher had been taught the evening before to accept a temporarylapse but had quickly enough again with her getting out of herown house and her walking across half the town for she had comefrom portland place on foot found breath still in its lungs it exhaled this breath in a sigh faint and unheard her tribute while she stood there before speaking to realities loomingthrough the golden mist that had already begun to be scattered the conditions facing her had yielded for the time to thegolden mist had considerably melted away but there they wereagain definite and it was for the next quarter of an hour as ifshe could have counted them one by one on her fingers sharp toher above all was the renewed attestation of her father scomprehensive acceptances which she had so long regarded as ofthe same quality with her own but which so distinctly now sheshould have the complication of being obliged to deal withseparately they had not yet struck her as absolutelyextraordinary which had made for her lumping them with her own since her view of her own had but so lately begun to change though it instantly stood out for her that there was really nonew judgment of them she should be able to show withoutattracting in some degree his attention without perhaps excitinghis surprise and making thereby for the situation she sharedwith him some difference she was reminded and warned by theconcrete image and for a minute charlotte s face immediatelypresented to her affected her as searching her own to see thereminder tell she had not less promptly kissed her stepmother and then had bent over her father from behind and laid hercheek upon him little amenities tantamount heretofore to an easychange of guard charlotte s own frequent though alwayscheerful term of comparison for this process of transfer maggiefigured thus as the relieving sentry and so smoothly did use andcustom work for them that her mate might even on this occasion after acceptance of the pass word have departed withoutirrelevant and in strictness unsoldierly gossip this was not none the less what happened inasmuch as if our young woman hadbeen floated over her first impulse to break the existing charmat a stroke it yet took her but an instant to sound at anyrisk the note she had been privately practising if she hadpractised it the day before at dinner on amerigo she knew butthe better how to begin for it with mrs verver and it immenselyhelped her for that matter to be able at once to speak of theprince as having done more to quicken than to soothe hercuriosity frankly and gaily she had come to ask to ask what intheir unusually prolonged campaign the two had achieved she hadgot out of her husband she admitted what she could buthusbands were never the persons who answered such questionsideally he had only made her more curious and she had arrivedearly this way in order to miss as little as possible ofcharlotte s story wives papa she said are always much better reporters though i grant she added for charlotte that fathers are notmuch better than husbands he never she smiled tells me morethan a tenth of what you tell him so i hope you haven t told himeverything yet since in that case i shall probably have lost thebest part of it maggie went she went she felt herself going she reminded herself of an actress who had been studying a partand rehearsing it but who suddenly on the stage before thefootlights had begun to improvise to speak lines not in thetext it was this very sense of the stage and the footlights thatkept her up made her rise higher just as it was the sense ofaction that logically involved some platform action quitepositively for the first time in her life or counting in theprevious afternoon for the second the platform remained forthree or four days thus sensibly under her feet and she had allthe while with it the inspiration of quite remarkably of quiteheroically improvising preparation and practice had come but ashort way her part opened out and she invented from moment tomoment what to say and to do she had but one rule of art tokeep within bounds and not lose her head certainly she might seefor a week how far that would take her she said to herself inher excitement that it was perfectly simple to bring about adifference touch by touch without letting either of the three and least of all her father so much as suspect her hand if theyshould suspect they would want a reason and the humiliatingtruth was that she wasn t ready with a reason not that is withwhat she would have called a reasonable one she thought ofherself instinctively beautifully as having dealt all herlife at her father s side and by his example only in reasonablereasons and what she would really have been most ashamed ofwould be to produce for him in this line some inferiorsubstitute unless she were in a position to plead definitely that she was jealous she should be in no position to plead decently that she was dissatisfied this latter condition wouldbe a necessary implication of the former without the formerbehind it it would have to fall to the ground so had the case wonderfully been arranged for her there was a card she couldplay but there was only one and to play it would be to end thegame she felt herself as at the small square green table between the tall old silver candlesticks and the neatly arrangedcounters her father s playmate and partner and what itconstantly came back to in her mind was that for her to ask aquestion to raise a doubt to reflect in any degree on the playof the others would be to break the charm the charm she had tocall it since it kept her companion so constantly engaged so perpetually seated and so contentedly occupied to sayanything at all would be in fine to have to say why she wasjealous and she could in her private hours but stare long with suffused eyes at that impossibility by the end of a week the week that had begun especially withher morning hour in eaton square between her father and hiswife her consciousness of being beautifully treated had becomeagain verily greater than her consciousness of anything else andi must add moreover that she at last found herself rather oddlywondering what else as a consciousness could have been quite sooverwhelming charlotte s response to the experiment of beingmore with her ought as she very well knew to have stamped theexperiment with the feeling of success so that if the successitself seemed a boon less substantial than the original image ofit it enjoyed thereby a certain analogy with our young woman saftertaste of amerigo s own determined demonstrations maggie wasto have retained for that matter more than one aftertaste andif i have spoken of the impressions fixed in her as soon as shehad so insidiously taken the field a definite note must bemade of her perception during those moments of charlotte sprompt uncertainty she had shown no doubt she couldn t nothave shown that she had arrived with an idea quite exactly asshe had shown her husband the night before that she wasawaiting him with a sentiment this analogy in the two situationswas to keep up for her the remembrance of a kinship of expressionin the two faces in respect to which all she as yet professed toherself was that she had affected them or at any rate thesensibility each of them so admirably covered in the same way to make the comparison at all was for maggie to return to itoften to brood upon it to extract from it the last dregs of itsinterest to play with it in short nervously vaguely incessantly as she might have played with a medallion containingon either side a cherished little portrait and suspended roundher neck by a gold chain of a firm fineness that no effort wouldever snap the miniatures were back to back but she saw themforever face to face and when she looked from one to the othershe found in charlotte s eyes the gleam of the momentary whatdoes she really want that had come and gone for her in theprince s so again she saw the other light the light touchedinto a glow both in portland place and in eaton square as soonas she had betrayed that she wanted no harm wanted no greaterharm of charlotte that is than to take in that she meant to goout with her she had been present at that process as personallyas she might have been present at some other domestic incident the hanging of a new picture say or the fitting of theprincipino with his first little trousers she remained present accordingly all the week so charminglyand systematically did mrs verver now welcome her company charlotte had but wanted the hint and what was it but the hint after all that during the so subdued but so ineffaceablepassage in the breakfast room she had seen her take it had beentaken moreover not with resignation not with qualifications orreserves however bland it had been taken with avidity withgratitude with a grace of gentleness that supplantedexplanations the very liberality of this accommodation mightindeed have appeared in the event to give its own account of thematter as if it had fairly written the princess down as a personof variations and had accordingly conformed but to a rule of tactin accepting these caprices for law the caprice actuallyprevailing happened to be that the advent of one of the ladiesanywhere should till the fit had changed become the sign unfailingly of the advent of the other and it was emblazoned in rich colour on the bright face of this period that mrs verver only wished to know on any occasion what was expected ofher only held herself there for instructions in order even tobetter them if possible the two young women while the passagelasted became again very much the companions of other days thedays of charlotte s prolonged visits to the admiring andbountiful maggie the days when equality of condition for themhad been all the result of the latter s native vagueness abouther own advantages the earlier elements flushed into life again the frequency the intimacy the high pitch of accompanyingexpression appreciation endearment confidence the rarer charmproduced in each by this active contribution to the felicity ofthe other all enhanced furthermore enhanced or qualified whoshould say which by a new note of diplomacy almost of anxiety just sensible on charlotte s part in particular of intensity ofobservance in the matter of appeal and response in thematter of making sure the princess might be disposed orgratified that resembled an attempt to play again with morerefinement at disparity of relation charlotte s attitude had in short its moments of flowering into pretty excesses ofcivility self effacements in the presence of others suddenlittle formalisms of suggestion and recognition that might haverepresented her sense of the duty of not losing sight of asocial distinction this impression came out most for maggiewhen in their easier intervals they had only themselves toregard and when her companion s inveteracy of never passingfirst of not sitting till she was seated of not interruptingtill she appeared to give leave of not forgetting too familiarly that in addition to being important she was alsosensitive had the effect of throwing over their intercourse akind of silver tissue of decorum it hung there above them like acanopy of state a reminder that though the lady in waiting wasan established favourite safe in her position a little queen however good natured was always a little queen and might withsmall warning remember it and yet another of these concomitants of feverish success allthe while was the perception that in another quarter too thingswere being made easy charlotte s alacrity in meeting her had inone sense operated slightly overmuch as an intervention it hadbegun to reabsorb her at the very hour of her husband s showingher that to be all there as the phrase was he likewise onlyrequired as one of the other phrases was too the straight tip she had heard him talk about the straight tip in his moods ofamusement at english slang in his remarkable displays ofassimilative power power worthy of better causes and higherinspirations and he had taken it from her at need in a waythat certainly in the first glow of relief had made her briefinterval seem large then however immediately and even thoughsuperficially there had declared itself a readjustment ofrelations to which she was once more practically a littlesacrificed i must do everything she had said withoutletting papa see what i do at least till it s done but shescarce knew how she proposed even for the next few days toblind or beguile this participant in her life what had in factpromptly enough happened she presently recognised was that ifher stepmother had beautifully taken possession of her and ifshe had virtually been rather snatched again thereby from herhusband s side so on the other hand this had with as littledelay entailed some very charming assistance for her in eatonsquare when she went home with charlotte from whatever happydemonstration for the benefit of the world in which theysupposed themselves to live that there was no smallest reasonwhy their closer association shouldn t be public and acclaimed at these times she regularly found that amerigo had come eitherto sit with his father in law in the absence of the ladies or tomake on his side precisely some such display of the easyworking of the family life as would represent the equivalent ofher excursions with charlotte under this particular impressionit was that everything in maggie most melted and went to pieces every thing that is that belonged to her disposition tochallenge the perfection of their common state it divided themagain that was true this particular turn of the tide cut themup afresh into pairs and parties quite as if a sense for theequilibrium was what between them all had most power ofinsistence quite as if amerigo himself were all the while atbottom equally thinking of it and watching it but as againstthat he was making her father not miss her and he could haverendered neither of them a more excellent service he was actingin short on a cue the cue given him by observation it had beenenough for him to see the shade of change in her behaviour hisinstinct for relations the most exquisite conceivable promptedhim immediately to meet and match the difference to play somehowinto its hands that was what it was she renewedly felt to havemarried a man who was sublimely a gentleman so that in spiteof her not wanting to translate all their delicacies into thegrossness of discussion she yet found again and again inportland place moments for saying if i didn t love you youknow for yourself i should still love you for him he lookedat her after such speeches as charlotte looked in eatonsquare when she called her attention to his benevolence throughthe dimness of the almost musing smile that took account of herextravagance harmless though it might be as a tendency toreckon with but my poor child charlotte might under thispressure have been on the point of replying that s the way nicepeople are all round so that why should one be surprised aboutit we re all nice together as why shouldn t we be if we hadn tbeen we wouldn t have gone far and i consider that we ve gonevery far indeed why should you take on as if you weren t aperfect dear yourself capable of all the sweetest things as ifyou hadn t in fact grown up in an atmosphere the atmosphere ofall the good things that i recognised even of old as soon as icame near you and that you ve allowed me now between you tomake so blessedly my own mrs verver might in fact have butjust failed to make another point a point charmingly natural toher as a grateful and irreproachable wife it isn t a bitwonderful i may also remind you that your husband should find when opportunity permits worse things to do than to go aboutwith mine i happen love to appreciate my husband i happenperfectly to understand that his acquaintance should becultivated and his company enjoyed some such happily provoked remarks as these from charlotte atthe other house had been in the air but we have seen how therewas also in the air for our young woman as an emanation fromthe same source a distilled difference of which the veryprinciple was to keep down objections and retorts thatimpression came back it had its hours of doing so and it mayinterest us on the ground of its having prompted in maggie afinal reflection a reflection out of the heart of which a lightflashed for her like a great flower grown in a night as soon asthis light had spread a little it produced in some quarters asurprising distinctness made her of a sudden ask herself whythere should have been even for three days the least obscurity the perfection of her success decidedly was like some strangeshore to which she had been noiselessly ferried and where with astart she found herself quaking at the thought that the boatmight have put off again and left her the word for it the wordthat flashed the light was that they were treating her thatthey were proceeding with her and for that matter with herfather by a plan that was the exact counterpart of her own itwas not from her that they took their cue but and this was whatin particular made her sit up from each other and with a depthof unanimity an exact coincidence of inspiration that when onceher attention had begun to fix it struck her as staring out ather in recovered identities of behaviour expression and tone they had a view of her situation and of the possible forms herown consciousness of it might take a view determined by thechange of attitude they had had ever so subtly to recognise inher on their return from matcham they had had to read into thissmall and all but suppressed variation a mute comment on theydidn t quite know what and it now arched over the princess shead like a vault of bold span that important communicationbetween them on the subject couldn t have failed of beingimmediate this new perception bristled for her as we have said with odd intimations but questions unanswered played in and outof it as well the question for instance of why suchpromptitude of harmony should have been important ah when shebegan to recover piece by piece the process became lively shemight have been picking small shining diamonds out of thesweepings of her ordered house she bent in this pursuit overher dust bin she challenged to the last grain the refuse of herinnocent economy then it was that the dismissed vision ofamerigo that evening in arrest at the door of her salottinowhile her eyes from her placed chair took him in then it wasthat this immense little memory gave out its full power sincethe question was of doors she had afterwards she now saw shutit out she had responsibly shut in as we have understood shutin there with her sentient self only the fact of hisreappearance and the plenitude of his presence these things hadbeen testimony after all to supersede any other for on thespot even while she looked the warmly washing wave hadtravelled far up the strand she had subsequently lived forhours she couldn t count under the dizzying smothering welterpositively in submarine depths where everything came to herthrough walls of emerald and mother of pearl though indeed shehad got her head above them for breath when face to face withcharlotte again on the morrow in eaton square meanwhile nonethe less as was so apparent the prior the prime impression hadremained in the manner of a spying servant on the other side ofthe barred threshold a witness availing himself in time of thelightest pretext to re enter it was as if he had found thispretext in her observed necessity of comparing comparing theobvious common elements in her husband s and her stepmother sways of now taking her with or without her witness at anyrate she was led by comparison to a sense of the quantity ofearnest intention operating and operating so harmoniously between her companions and it was in the mitigated midnight ofthese approximations that she had made out the promise of herdawn it was a worked out scheme for their not wounding her for theirbehaving to her quite nobly to which each had in some winningway induced the other to contribute and which therefore so faras that went proved that she had become with them a subject ofintimate study quickly quickly on a certain alarm taken eagerly and anxiously before they should without knowing it wound her they had signalled from house to house their cleveridea the idea by which for all these days her own idea hadbeen profiting they had built her in with their purpose whichwas why above her a vault seemed more heavily to arch so thatshe sat there in the solid chamber of her helplessness as in abath of benevolence artfully prepared for her over the brim ofwhich she could but just manage to see by stretching her neck baths of benevolence were very well but at least unless onewere a patient of some sort a nervous eccentric or a lost child one was usually not so immersed save by one s request it wasn tin the least what she had requested she had flapped her littlewings as a symbol of desired flight not merely as a plea for amore gilded cage and an extra allowance of lumps of sugar aboveall she hadn t complained not by the quaver of a syllable sowhat wound in particular had she shown her fear of receiving what wound had she received as to which she had exchanged theleast word with them if she had ever whined or moped they mighthave had some reason but she would be hanged she conversed withherself in strong language if she had been from beginning toend anything but pliable and mild it all came back inconsequence to some required process of their own a processoperating quite positively as a precaution and a policy theyhad got her into the bath and for consistency with themselves which was with each other must keep her there in that conditionshe wouldn t interfere with the policy which was established which was arranged her thought over this arrived at a greatintensity had indeed its pauses and timidities but always totake afterwards a further and lighter spring the ground waswell nigh covered by the time she had made out her husband andhis colleague as directly interested in preventing her freedom ofmovement policy or no policy it was they themselves who werearranged she must be kept in position so as not to disarrangethem it fitted immensely together the whole thing as soon asshe could give them a motive for strangely as it had by thistime begun to appear to herself she had hitherto not imaginedthem sustained by an ideal distinguishably different from herown of course they were arranged all four arranged but whathad the basis of their life been precisely but that they werearranged together amerigo and charlotte were arranged together but she to confine the matter only to herself was arrangedapart it rushed over her the full sense of all this with quiteanother rush from that of the breaking wave of ten days before and as her father himself seemed not to meet the vaguely clutching hand with which during the first shock of completeperception she tried to steady herself she felt very muchalone xxviithere had been from far back that is from the christmas timeon a plan that the parent and the child should do somethinglovely together and they

that they were but wanting forsome such adventure to snatch their moment whether either hadat any instant seen it as workable save in the form of a toy todangle before the other that they should take

as their regularlife had been persisting full of shared mornings afternoons evenings walks drives looks in at old places on vaguechances full also in especial of that purchased social ease the sense of the comfort and credit of their house which hadessentially the perfection of something paid for but which came on the whole so cheap that it might have been felt ascosting as costing the parent and child nothing it was formaggie to wonder at present if she had been sincere about theirgoing to ask herself whether she would have stuck to their planeven if nothing had happened her view of the impossibility of sticking to it now may give usthe measure of her sense that everything had happened adifference had been made in her relation to each of hercompanions and what it compelled her to say to herself was thatto behave as she might have behaved before would be to act foramerigo and charlotte with the highest hypocrisy she saw inthese days that a journey abroad with her father would more thananything else have amounted on his part and her own to a lastexpression of an ecstasy of confidence and that the charm of theidea in fact had been in some such sublimity day after day sheput off the moment of speaking as she inwardly and verycomprehensively called it speaking that is to her father andall the more that she was ridden by a strange suspense as to hishimself breaking silence she gave him time gave him duringseveral days that morning that noon that night and the nextand the next and the next even made up her mind that if he stoodoff longer it would be proof conclusive that he too wasn t atpeace they would then have been all successfully throwing dustin each other s eyes and it would be at last as if they mustturn away their faces since the silver mist that protected themhad begun to grow sensibly thin finally at the end of april she decided that if he should say nothing for another period oftwenty four hours she must take it as showing that they were inher private phraseology lost so little possible sincerity couldthere be in pretending to care for a journey to spain at theapproach of a summer that already promised to be hot such aproposal on his lips such an extravagance of optimism would behis way of being consistent for that he didn t really want tomove or to move further at the worst than back to fawns again could only signify that he wasn t at heart contented what hewanted at any rate and what he didn t want were in the event put to the proof for maggie just in time to give her a freshwind she had been dining with her husband in eaton square onthe occasion of hospitality offered by mr and mrs verver tolord and lady castledean the propriety of some demonstration ofthis sort had been for many days before our group the questionreduced to the mere issue of which of the two houses should firsttake the field the issue had been easily settled in the mannerof every issue referred in any degree to amerigo and charlotte the initiative obviously belonged to mrs verver who had gone tomatcham while maggie had stayed away and the evening in eatonsquare might have passed for a demonstration all the morepersonal that the dinner had been planned on intimate lines six other guests only in addition to the host and the hostess ofmatcham made up the company and each of these persons had formaggie the interest of an attested connection with the easterrevels at that visionary house their common memory of anoccasion that had clearly left behind it an ineffaceable charm this air of beatific reference less subdued in the others thanin amerigo and charlotte lent them together an inscrutablecomradeship against which the young woman s imagination broke ina small vain wave it wasn t that she wished she had been of the remembered partyand possessed herself of its secrets for she didn t care aboutits secrets she could concern herself at present absolutely with no secret but her own what occurred was simply that shebecame aware at a stroke of the quantity of further nourishmentrequired by her own and of the amount of it she might somehowextract from these people whereby she rose of a sudden to thedesire to possess and use them even to the extent of braving offairly defying of directly exploiting of possibly quiteenjoying under cover of an evil duplicity the felt element ofcuriosity with which they regarded her once she was conscious ofthe flitting wing of this last impression the perception irresistible that she was something for their queer experience just as they were something for hers there was no limit to herconceived design of not letting them escape she went and went again to night after her start was taken went positively asshe had felt herself going three weeks before on the morningwhen the vision of her father and his wife awaiting her togetherin the breakfast room had been so determinant in this otherscene it was lady castledean who was determinant who kindled thelight or at all events the heat and who acted on the nerves lady castledean whom she knew she so oddly didn t like inspite of reasons upon reasons the biggest diamonds on theyellowest hair the longest lashes on the prettiest falsesteyes the oldest lace on the most violet velvet the rightestmanner on the wrongest assumption her ladyship s assumption wasthat she kept at every moment of her life every advantage itmade her beautifully soft very nearly generous so she didn tdistinguish the little protuberant eyes of smaller socialinsects often endowed with such a range from the otherdecorative spots on their bodies and wings maggie had liked inlondon and in the world at large so many more people than shehad thought it right to fear right even to so much as judge that it positively quickened her fever to have to recognise inthis case such a lapse of all the sequences it was only that acharming clever woman wondered about her that is wondered abouther as amerigo s wife and wondered moreover with the intentionof kindness and the spontaneity almost of surprise the point of view that one was what she read in their freecontemplation in that of the whole eight there was something inamerigo to be explained and she was passed about all tenderlyand expertly like a dressed doll held in the right manner byits firmly stuffed middle for the account she could give shemight have been made to give it by pressure of her stomach shemight have been expected to articulate with a rare imitation ofnature oh yes i m here all the while i m also in my way asolid little fact and i cost originally a great deal of money cost that is my father for my outfit and let in my husbandfor an amount of pains toward my training that money wouldscarce represent well she would meet them in some such way and she translated her idea into action after dinner beforethey dispersed by engaging them all unconventionally almostviolently to dine with her in portland place just as they were if they didn t mind the same party which was the party shewanted oh she was going she was going she could feel itafresh it was a good deal as if she had sneezed ten times or hadsuddenly burst into a comic song there were breaks in theconnection as there would be hitches in the process she didn twholly see yet what they would do for her nor quite how herself she should handle them but she was dancing up and down beneath her propriety with the thought that she had at leastbegun something she so fairly liked to feel that she was a pointfor convergence of wonder it wasn t after all either thattheir wonder so much signified that of the cornered six whom itglimmered before her that she might still live to drive aboutlike a flock of sheep the intensity of her consciousness itssharpest savour was in the theory of her having diverted having as they said captured the attention of amerigo andcharlotte at neither of whom all the while did she so much asonce look she had pitched them in with the six for that matter so far as they themselves were concerned they had dropped forthe succession of minutes out of contact with their function had in short startled and impressed abandoned their post they re paralysed they re paralysed she commented deepwithin so much it helped her own apprehension to hang togetherthat they should suddenly lose their bearings her grasp of appearances was thus out of proportion to her viewof causes but it came to her then and there that if she couldonly get the facts of appearance straight only jam them downinto their place the reasons lurking behind them keptuncertain for the eyes by their wavering and shifting wouldn tperhaps be able to help showing it wasn t of course that theprince and mrs verver marvelled to see her civil to theirfriends it was rather precisely that civil was just what shewasn t she had so departed from any such custom of delicateapproach approach by the permitted note the suggested if theaccepted vagueness as would enable the people in question to puther off if they wished and the profit of her plan the effect ofthe violence she was willing to let it go for was exactly intheir being the people in question people she had seemed to berather shy of before and for whom she suddenly opened her mouthso wide later on we may add with the ground soon covered byher agitated but resolute step it was to cease to matter whatpeople they were or weren t but meanwhile the particular senseof them that she had taken home to night had done her the serviceof seeming to break the ice where that formation was thickest still more unexpectedly the service might have been the same forher father inasmuch as immediately when everyone had gone hedid exactly what she had been waiting for and despairing of anddid it as he did everything with a simplicity that left anypurpose of sounding him deeper of drawing him out further ofgoing in his own frequent phrase behind what he said nothingwhatever to do he brought it out straight made it bravely andbeautifully irrelevant save for the plea of what they shouldlose by breaking the charm i guess we won t go down there afterall will we mag just when it s getting so pleasant here that was all with nothing to lead up to it but it was done forher at a stroke and done not less more rather for amerigo andcharlotte on whom the immediate effect as she secretly as shealmost breathlessly measured it was prodigious everything nowso fitted for her to everything else that she could feel theeffect as prodigious even while sticking to her policy of givingthe pair no look there were thus some five wonderful minutesduring which they loomed to her sightless eyes on either sideof her larger than they had ever loomed before larger thanlife larger than thought larger than any danger or any safety there was thus a space of time in fine fairly vertiginous forher during which she took no more account of them than if theywere not in the room she had never never treated them in any such way not even justnow when she had plied her art upon the matcham band herpresent manner was an intenser exclusion and the air was chargedwith their silence while she talked with her other companion asif she had nothing but him to consider he had given her the noteamazingly by his allusion to the pleasantness that of such anoccasion as his successful dinner which might figure as theirbribe for renouncing so that it was all as if they were speakingselfishly counting on a repetition of just such extensions ofexperience maggie achieved accordingly an act of unprecedentedenergy threw herself into her father s presence as by theabsolute consistency with which she held his eyes saying toherself at the same time that she smiled and talked andinaugurated her system what does he mean by it that s thequestion what does he mean but studying again all the signs inhim that recent anxiety had made familiar and counting thestricken minutes on the part of the others it was in theirsilence that the others loomed as she felt she had had nomeasure she afterwards knew of this duration but it drew outand out really to what would have been called in simplerconditions awkwardness as if she herself were stretching thecord ten minutes later however in the homeward carriage towhich her husband cutting delay short had proceeded at thefirst announcement ten minutes later she was to stretch italmost to breaking the prince had permitted her to linger muchless before his move to the door than they usually lingered atthe gossiping close of such evenings which she all responsive took for a sign of his impatience to modify for her the oddeffect of his not having and of charlotte s not having instantly acclaimed the issue of the question debated or moreexactly settled before them he had had time to become aware ofthis possible impression in her and his virtually urging herinto the carriage was connected with his feeling that he musttake action on the new ground a certain ambiguity in her wouldabsolutely have tormented him but he had already found somethingto soothe and correct as to which she had on her side a shrewdnotion of what it would be she was herself for that matter prepared and she was of a truth as she took her seat in thebrougham amazed at her preparation it allowed her scarce aninterval she brought it straight out i was certain that was what father would say if i should leavehim alone i have been leaving him alone and you see the effect he hates now to move he likes too much to be with us but if yousee the effect she felt herself magnificently keeping it up perhaps you don t see the cause the cause my dear is toolovely her husband on taking his place beside her had during a minuteor two for her watching sense neither said nor done anything he had been for that sense as if thinking waiting deciding yet it was still before he spoke that he as she felt it to be definitely acted he put his arm round her and drew her close indulged in the demonstration the long firm embrace by hissingle arm the infinite pressure of her whole person to his own that such opportunities had so often suggested and prescribed held accordingly and as she could but too intimately feel exquisitely solicited she had said the thing she was intendingand desiring to say and as to which she felt even more than shefelt anything else that whatever he might do she mustn t beirresponsible yes she was in his exerted grasp and she knewwhat that was but she was at the same time in the grasp of herconceived responsibility and the extraordinary thing was that of the two intensities the second was presently to become thesharper he took his time for it meanwhile but he met her speechafter a fashion the cause of your father s deciding not to go yes and of my having wanted to let it act for him quietly imean without my insistence she had in her compressed state another pause and it made her feel as if she were immenselyresisting strange enough was this sense for her and altogethernew the sense of possessing by miraculous help some advantagethat absolutely then and there in the carriage as they rolled she might either give up or keep strange inexpressiblystrange so distinctly she saw that if she did give it up sheshould somehow give up everything for ever and what herhusband s grasp really meant as her very bones registered wasthat she should give it up it was exactly for this that he hadresorted to unfailing magic he knew how to resort to it hecould be on occasion as she had lately more than ever learned so munificent a lover all of which was precisely a part of thecharacter she had never ceased to regard in him as princely apart of his large and beautiful ease his genius for charm forintercourse for expression for life she should have but to layher head back on his shoulder with a certain movement to make itdefinite for him that she didn t resist to this as they went every throb of her consciousness prompted her every throb thatis but one the throb of her deeper need to know where she really was by the time she had uttered the rest of her idea therefore she was still keeping her head and intending to keepit though she was also staring out of the carriage window witheyes into which the tears of suffered pain had risen indistinguishable perhaps happily in the dusk she was makingan effort that horribly hurt her and as she couldn t cry out her eyes swam in her silence with them all the same throughthe square opening beside her through the grey panorama of thelondon night she achieved the feat of not losing sight of whatshe wanted and her lips helped and protected her by being ableto be gay it s not to leave you my dear for that he ll giveup anything just as he would go off anywhere i think you know if you would go with him i mean you and he alone maggiepursued with her gaze out of her window for which amerigo s answer again took him a moment ah the dearold boy you would like me to propose him something well if you think you could bear it and leave the prince asked you and charlotte alone why not maggie had also to wait a minute but when she spokeit came clear why shouldn t charlotte be just one of myreasons my not liking to leave her she has always been so good so perfect to me but never so wonderfully as just now we havesomehow been more together thinking for the time almost onlyof each other it has been quite as in old days and sheproceeded consummately for she felt it as consummate it s asif we had been missing each other had got a little apart thoughgoing on so side by side but the good moments if one only waitsfor them she hastened to add come round of themselves moreover you ve seen for yourself since you ve made it up so tofather feeling for yourself in your beautiful way everydifference every air that blows not having to be told orpushed only being perfect to live with through your habit ofkindness and your exquisite instincts but of course you veseen all the while that both he and i have deeply felt howyou ve managed managed that he hasn t been too much alone andthat i on my side haven t appeared to what you might call neglect him this is always she continued what i can neverbless you enough for of all the good things you ve done for meyou ve never done anything better she went on explaining as forthe pleasure of explaining even though knowing he mustrecognise as a part of his easy way too her description of hislarge liberality your taking the child down yourself thosedays and your coming each time to bring him away nothing inthe world nothing you could have invented would have keptfather more under the charm besides you know how you ve alwayssuited him and how you ve always so beautifully let it seem tohim that he suits you only it has been these last weeks as ifyou wished just in order to please him to remind him of itafresh so there it is she wound up it s your doing you veproduced your effect that of his wanting not to be even for amonth or two where you re not he doesn t want to bother or boreyou that i think you know he never has done and if you llonly give me time i ll come round again to making it my care asalways that he shan t but he can t bear you out of his sight she had kept it up and up filling it out crowding it in andall really without difficulty for it was every word of it thanks to a long evolution of feeling what she had been primedto the brim with she made the picture forced it upon him hungit before him remembering happily how he had gone so far oneday supported by the principino as to propose the zoo in eatonsquare to carry with him there on the spot under this pleasantinspiration both his elder and his younger companion with thelatter of whom he had taken the tone that they were introducinggranddaddy granddaddy nervous and rather funking it to lionsand tigers more or less at large touch by touch she thus droppedinto her husband s silence the truth about his good nature andhis good manners and it was this demonstration of his virtue precisely that added to the strangeness even for herself ofher failing as yet to yield to him it would be a question but ofthe most trivial act of surrender the vibration of a nerve themere movement of a muscle but the act grew important betweenthem just through her doing perceptibly nothing nothing but talkin the very tone that would naturally have swept her intotenderness she knew more and more every lapsing minute taughther how he might by a single rightness make her cease to watchhim that rightness a million miles removed from the queeractual falling so short which would consist of his breaking outto her diviningly indulgently with the last happyinconsequence come away with me somewhere you and then weneedn t think we needn t even talk of anything of anyoneelse five words like that would answer her would break herutterly down but they were the only ones that would so serve she waited for them and there was a supreme instant when by thetestimony of all the rest of him she seemed to feel them in hisheart and on his lips only they didn t sound and as that madeher wait again so it made her more intensely watch this in turnshowed her that he too watched and waited and how much he hadexpected something that he now felt wouldn t come yes itwouldn t come if he didn t answer her if he but said the wrongthings instead of the right if he could say the right everythingwould come it hung by a hair that everything might crystallisefor their recovered happiness at his touch this possibilityglowed at her however for fifty seconds only then to turncold and as it fell away from her she felt the chill of realityand knew again all but pressed to his heart and with his breathupon her cheek the slim rigour of her attitude a rigour beyondthat of her natural being they had silences at last that werealmost crudities of mutual resistance silences that persistedthrough his felt effort to treat her recurrence to the part hehad lately played to interpret all the sweetness of her sotalking to him as a manner of making love to him ah it was nosuch manner heaven knew for maggie she could make love ifthis had been in question better than that on top of which itcame to her presently to say keeping in with what she hadalready spoken except of course that for the question of goingoff somewhere he d go readily quite delightedly with you iverily believe he d like to have you for a while to himself do you mean he thinks of proposing it the prince after amoment sounded oh no he doesn t ask as you must so often have seen but ibelieve he d go like a shot as you say if you were to suggestit it had the air she knew of a kind of condition made and shehad asked herself while she spoke if it wouldn t cause his arm tolet her go the fact that it didn t suggested to her that she hadmade him of a sudden still more intensely think think withsuch concentration that he could do but one thing at once and itwas precisely as if the concentration had the next moment beenproved in him he took a turn inconsistent with the superficialimpression a jump that made light of their approach to gravityand represented for her the need in him to gain time that shemade out was his drawback that the warning from her had come tohim and had come to charlotte after all too suddenly thatthey were in face of it rearranging that they had to rearrange was all before her again yet to do as they would like they mustenjoy a snatch longer or shorter of recovered independence amerigo for the instant was but doing as he didn t like and itwas as if she were watching his effort without disguise what syour father s idea this year then about fawns will he go atwhitsuntide and will he then stay on maggie went through the form of thought he will really do iimagine as he has in so many ways so often done before dowhatever may seem most agreeable to yourself and there s ofcourse always charlotte to be considered only their going earlyto fawns if they do go she said needn t in the least entailyour and my going ah amerigo echoed it needn t in the least entail your and mygoing we can do as we like what they may do needn t trouble us sincethey re by good fortune perfectly happy together oh the prince returned your father s never so happy as withyou near him to enjoy his being so well i may enjoy it said maggie but i m not the cause ofit you re the cause her husband declared of the greater part ofeverything that s good among us but she received this tributein silence and the next moment he pursued if mrs verver hasarrears of time with you to make up as you say she ll scarcelydo it or you scarcely will by our cutting your and my cutting too loose i see what you mean maggie mused he let her for a little to give her attention to it after which shall i just quite of a sudden he asked propose him ajourney maggie hesitated but she brought forth the fruit of reflection it would have the merit that charlotte then would be with me with me i mean so much more also that i shouldn t by choosingsuch a time for going away seem unconscious and ungrateful seemnot to respond seem in fact rather to wish to shake her off ishould respond on the contrary very markedly by being herealone with her for a month and would you like to be here alone with her for a month i could do with it beautifully or we might even she saidquite gaily go together down to fawns you could be so very content without me the prince presentlyinquired yes my own dear if you could be content for a while withfather that would keep me up i might for the time she wenton go to stay there with charlotte or better still she mightcome to portland place oho said the prince with cheerful vagueness i should feel you see she continued that the two of us wereshowing the same sort of kindness amerigo thought the two of us charlotte and i maggie again hesitated you and i darling i see i see he promptly took it in and what reason shall igive give i mean your father for asking him to go off why the very simplest if youconscientiously can the desire said maggie to be agreeableto him just that only something in this reply made her husband again reflect conscientiously why shouldn t i conscientiously it wouldn t by your own contention he developed represent any surprisefor him i must strike him sufficiently as at the worst thelast person in the world to wish to do anything to hurt him ah there it was again for maggie the note already sounded thenote of the felt need of not working harm why this precautionaryview she asked herself afresh when her father had complained at the very least as little as herself with their stillnesstogether so perfect what had suggested so around them theattitude of sparing them her inner vision fixed it once more this attitude saw it in the others as vivid and concrete extended it straight from her companion to charlotte before shewas well aware accordingly she had echoed in this intensity ofthought amerigo s last words you re the last person in theworld to wish to do anything to hurt him she heard herself heard her tone after she had spoken andheard it the more that for a minute after she felt herhusband s eyes on her face very close too close for her to seehim he was looking at her because he was struck and lookinghard though his answer when it came was straight enough why isn t that just what we have been talking about that i veaffected you as fairly studying his comfort and his pleasure hemight show his sense of it the prince went on by proposing tome an excursion and you would go with him maggie immediately asked he hung fire but an instant per dio she also had her pause but she broke it since gaiety was in theair with an intense smile you can say that safely because theproposal s one that of his own motion he won t make she couldn t have narrated afterwards and in fact was at a lossto tell herself by what transition what rather markedabruptness of change in their personal relation their drive cameto its end with a kind of interval established almost confessedto between them she felt it in the tone with which he repeated after her safely safely as regards being thrown with him perhaps after all insuch a case too long he s a person to think you might easilyfeel yourself to be so it won t maggie said come fromfather he s too modest their eyes continued to meet on it from corner to corner of thebrougham oh your modesty between you but he still smiledfor it so that unless i insist we shall simply go on as we are well we re going on beautifully he answered though by nomeans with the effect it would have had if their mutetransaction that of attempted capture and achieved escape hadnot taken place as maggie said nothing none the less togainsay his remark it was open to him to find himself the nextmoment conscious of still another idea i wonder if it would do i mean for me to break in to break in between your father and his wife but there would be a way hesaid we can make charlotte ask him and then as maggie herselfnow wondered echoing it again we can suggest to her to suggestto him that he shall let me take him off oh said maggie then if he asks her why i so suddenly break out she ll be ableto tell him the reason they were stopping and the footman who had alighted had rungat the house door that you think it would be so charming that i think it would be so charming that we ve persuaded herwill be convincing i see maggie went on while the footman came back to let themout i see she said again though she felt a littledisconcerted what she really saw of a sudden was that herstepmother might report her as above all concerned for theproposal and this brought her back her need that her fathershouldn t think her concerned in any degree for anything shealighted the next instant with a slight sense of defeat herhusband to let her out had passed before her and a little inadvance he awaited her on the edge of the low terrace a stephigh that preceded their open entrance on either side of whichone of their servants stood the sense of a life tremendouslyordered and fixed rose before her and there was something inamerigo s very face while his eyes again met her own through thedusky lamplight that was like a conscious reminder of it hehad answered her just before distinctly and it appeared toleave her nothing to say it was almost as if having planned forthe last word she saw him himself enjoying it it was almost asif in the strangest way in the world he were paying her back by the production of a small pang that of a new uneasiness forthe way she had slipped from him during their drive xxviiimaggie s new uneasiness might have had time to drop inasmuch asshe not only was conscious during several days that followed ofno fresh indication for it to feed on but was even struck inquite another way with an augmentation of the symptoms of thatdifference she had taken it into her head to work for sherecognised by the end of a week that if she had been in a mannercaught up her father had been not less so with the effect of herhusband s and his wife s closing in together round them and oftheir all having suddenly begun as a party of four to lead alife gregarious and from that reason almost hilarious so far asthe easy sound of it went as never before it might have been anaccident and a mere coincidence so at least she said to herselfat first but a dozen chances that furthered the whole appearancehad risen to the surface pleasant pretexts oh certainlypleasant as pleasant as amerigo in particular could make them for associated undertakings quite for shared adventures for itsalways turning out amusingly that they wanted to do very muchthe same thing at the same time and in the same way funny allthis was to some extent in the light of the fact that thefather and daughter for so long had expressed so few positivedesires yet it would be sufficiently natural that if amerigo andcharlotte had at last got a little tired of each other s companythey should find their relief not so much in sinking to therather low level of their companions as in wishing to pull thelatter into the train in which they so constantly moved we rein the train maggie mutely reflected after the dinner in eatonsquare with lady castledean we ve suddenly waked up in it andfound ourselves rushing along very much as if we had been put induring sleep shoved like a pair of labelled boxes into thevan and since i wanted to go i m certainly going she mighthave added i m moving without trouble they re doing it all forus it s wonderful how they understand and how perfectly itsucceeds for that was the thing she had most immediately toacknowledge it seemed as easy for them to make a quartette as ithad formerly so long appeared for them to make a pair ofcouples this latter being thus a discovery too absurdly belated the only point at which day after day the success appeared atall qualified was represented as might have been said by herirresistible impulse to give her father a clutch when the trainindulged in one of its occasional lurches then there was nodenying it his eyes and her own met so that they werethemselves doing active violence as against the others to thatvery spirit of union or at least to that very achievement ofchange which she had taken the field to invoke the maximum of change was reached no doubt the day the matchamparty dined in portland place the day really perhaps ofmaggie s maximum of social glory in the sense of its showing forher own occasion her very own with every one else extravagantlyrallying and falling in absolutely conspiring to make her itsheroine it was as if her father himself always with moreinitiative as a guest than as a host had dabbled too in theconspiracy and the impression was not diminished by the presenceof the assinghams likewise very much caught up now aftersomething of a lull by the side wind of all the rest of themotion and giving our young woman so far at least as fanny wasconcerned the sense of some special intention of encouragementand applause fanny who had not been present at the otherdinner thanks to a preference entertained and expressed bycharlotte made a splendid show at this one in neworange coloured velvet with multiplied turquoises and with aconfidence furthermore as different as possible her hostessinferred from her too marked betrayal of a belittled state atmatcham maggie was not indifferent to her own opportunity toredress this balance which seemed for the hour part of ageneral rectification she liked making out for herself that onthe high level of portland place a spot exempt on all sorts ofgrounds from jealous jurisdictions her friend could feel as good as any one and could in fact at moments almost appear totake the lead in recognition and celebration so far as theevening might conduce to intensify the lustre of the littleprincess mrs assingham produced on her the impression of givingher constantly her cue for this and it was in truth partly byher help intelligently quite gratefully accepted that thelittle princess in maggie was drawn out and emphasised shecouldn t definitely have said how it happened but she feltherself for the first time in her career living up to thepublic and popular notion of such a personage as it pressed uponher from all round rather wondering inwardly too while she didso at that strange mixture in things through which the popularnotion could be evidenced for her by such supposedly great onesof the earth as the castledeans and their kind fanny assinghammight really have been there at all events like one of theassistants in the ring at the circus to keep up the pace of thesleek revolving animal on whose back the lady in short spangledskirts should brilliantly caper and posture that was all doubtless maggie had forgotten had neglected had declined tobe the little princess on anything like the scale open to her but now that the collective hand had been held out to her withsuch alacrity so that she might skip up into the light even asseemed to her modest mind with such a show of pink stocking andsuch an abbreviation of white petticoat she could strike herselfas perceiving under arched eyebrows where her mistake had been she had invited for the later hours after her dinner a freshcontingent the whole list of her apparent london acquaintance which was again a thing in the manner of little princesses forwhom the princely art was a matter of course that was what shewas learning to do to fill out as a matter of course herappointed her expected her imposed character and though therewere latent considerations that somewhat interfered with thelesson she was having to night an inordinate quantity ofpractice none of it so successful as when quite wittingly shedirected it at lady castledean who was reduced by it at last toan unprecedented state of passivity the perception of this highresult caused mrs assingham fairly to flush with responsive joy she glittered at her young friend from moment to moment quitefeverishly it was positively as if her young friend had in somemarvellous sudden supersubtle way become a source of succourto herself become beautifully divinely retributive theintensity of the taste of these registered phenomena was in factthat somehow by a process and through a connexion not again tobe traced she so practised at the same time on amerigo andcharlotte with only the drawback her constant check andsecond thought that she concomitantly practised perhaps stillmore on her father this last was a danger indeed that for much of the ensuing time had its hours of strange beguilement those at which her sensefor precautions so suffered itself to lapse that she felt hercommunion with him more intimate than any other it couldn t butpass between them that something singular was happening so muchas this she again and again said to herself whereby the comfortof it was there after all to be noted just as much as thepossible peril and she could think of the couple they formedtogether as groping with sealed lips but with mutual looks thathad never been so tender for some freedom some fiction somefigured bravery under which they might safely talk of it themoment was to come and it finally came with an effect aspenetrating as the sound that follows the pressure of an electricbutton when she read the least helpful of meanings into theagitation she had created the merely specious description oftheir case would have been that after being for a long time asa family delightfully uninterruptedly happy they had still hada new felicity to discover a felicity for which blessedly herfather s appetite and her own in particular had been kept freshand grateful this livelier march of their intercourse as a wholewas the thing that occasionally determined in him the clutchinginstinct we have glanced at very much as if he had said to her in default of her breaking silence first everything isremarkably pleasant isn t it but where for it after all arewe up in a balloon and whirling through space or down in thedepths of the earth in the glimmering passages of a gold mine the equilibrium the precious condition lasted in spite ofrearrangement there had been a fresh distribution of thedifferent weights but the balance persisted and triumphed allof which was just the reason why she was forbidden face to facewith the companion of her adventure the experiment of a test ifthey balanced they balanced she had to take that it deprivedher of every pretext for arriving by however covert a process at what he thought but she had her hours thus of feeling supremely linked to himby the rigour of their law and when it came over her that allthe while the wish on his side to spare her might be what mostworked with him this very fact of their seeming to have nothing inward really to talk about wrapped him up for her in a kind ofsweetness that was wanting as a consecration even in heryearning for her husband she was powerless however was onlymore utterly hushed when the interrupting flash came when shewould have been all ready to say to him yes this is by everyappearance the best time we ve had yet but don t you see allthe same how they must be working together for it and how myvery success my success in shifting our beautiful harmony to anew basis comes round to being their success above all theircleverness their amiability their power to hold out theircomplete possession in short of our life for how could shesay as much as that without saying a great deal more withoutsaying they ll do everything in the world that suits us saveonly one thing prescribe a line for us that will make themseparate how could she so much as imagine herself even faintlymurmuring that without putting into his mouth the very words thatwould have made her quail separate my dear do you want themto separate then you want us to you and me for how can the oneseparation take place without the other that was the questionthat in spirit she had heard him ask with its dread train moreover of involved and connected inquiries their ownseparation his and hers was of course perfectly thinkable butonly on the basis of the sharpest of reasons well the sharpest the very sharpest would be that they could no longer afford asit were he to let his wife she to let her husband run themin such compact formation and say they accepted this account oftheir situation as a practical finality acting upon it andproceeding to a division would no sombre ghosts of the smotheredpast on either side show across the widening strait paleunappeased faces or raise in the very passage deprecating denouncing hands meanwhile however such things might be she was to have occasionto say to herself that there might be but a deeper treachery inrecoveries and reassurances she was to feel alone again as shehad felt at the issue of her high tension with her husband duringtheir return from meeting the castledeans in eaton square theevening in question had left her with a larger alarm but then alull had come the alarm after all was yet to be confirmed there came an hour inevitably when she knew with a chill whatshe had feared and why it had taken this hour a month toarrive but to find it before her was thoroughly to recognise it for it showed her sharply what amerigo had meant in alluding to aparticular use that they might make for their reaffirmed harmonyand prosperity of charlotte the more she thought at present of the tone he had employed to express their enjoyment of thisresource the more it came back to her as the product of aconscious art of dealing with her he had been conscious at themoment of many things conscious even not a little ofdesiring and thereby of needing to see what she would do in agiven case the given case would be that of her being to acertain extent as she might fairly make it out menaced horrible as it was to impute to him any intention represented by such a word why it was that to speak of making her stepmotherintervene as they might call it in a question that seemed justthen and there quite peculiarly their own business why it wasthat a turn so familiar and so easy should at the worst strikeher as charged with the spirit of a threat was an odditydisconnected for her temporarily from its grounds theadventure of an imagination within her that possibly had lost itsway that precisely was doubtless why she had learned to wait as the weeks passed by with a fair or rather indeed with anexcessive imitation of resumed serenity there had been noprompt sequel to the prince s equivocal light and that made forpatience yet she was none the less to have to admit afterdelay that the bread he had cast on the waters had come home and that she should thus be justified of her old apprehension the consequence of this in turn was a renewed pang in presenceof his remembered ingenuity to be ingenious with her whatdidn t what mightn t that mean when she had so absolutelynever at any point of contact with him put him by as much asthe value of a penny to the expense of sparing doubting fearing her of having in any way whatever to reckon with her the ingenuity had been in his simply speaking of their use ofcharlotte as if it were common to them in an equal degree andhis triumph on the occasion had been just in the simplicity she couldn t and he knew it say what was true oh you use her and i use her if you will yes but we use her ever sodifferently and separately not at all in the same way or degree there s nobody we really use together but ourselves don t yousee by which i mean that where our interests are the same i canso beautifully so exquisitely serve you for everything and youcan so beautifully so exquisitely serve me the only personeither of us needs is the other of us so why as a matter ofcourse in such a case as this drag in charlotte she couldn t so challenge him because it would have been andthere she was paralysed the note it would have translateditself on the spot for his ear into jealousy and fromreverberation to repercussion would have reached her father sexactly in the form of a cry piercing the stillness of peacefulsleep it had been for many days almost as difficult for her tocatch a quiet twenty minutes with her father as it had formerlybeen easy there had been in fact of old the time sostrangely seemed already far away an inevitability in herlonger passages with him a sort of domesticated beauty in thecalculability round about them of everything but at presentcharlotte was almost always there when amerigo brought her toeaton square where amerigo was constantly bringing her andamerigo was almost always there when charlotte brought herhusband to portland place where charlotte was constantlybringing him the fractions of occasions the chance minutes thatput them face to face had as yet of late contrived to countbut little between them either for the sense of opportunity orfor that of exposure inasmuch as the lifelong rhythm of theirintercourse made against all cursory handling of deep things they had never availed themselves of any given quarter of an hourto gossip about fundamentals they moved slowly through largestill spaces they could be silent together at any time beautifully with much more comfort than hurriedly expressive itappeared indeed to have become true that their common appealmeasured itself for vividness just by this economy of sound they might have been talking at each other when they talkedwith their companions but these latter assuredly were not inany directer way to gain light on the current phase of theirrelation such were some of the reasons for which maggiesuspected fundamentals as i have called them to be rising by anew movement to the surface suspected it one morning late inmay when her father presented himself in portland place alone he had his pretext of that she was fully aware the principino two days before had shown signs happily not persistent of afeverish cold and had notoriously been obliged to spend theinterval at home this was ground ample ground for punctualinquiry but what it wasn t ground for she quickly found herselfreflecting was his having managed in the interest of his visit to dispense so unwontedly as their life had recently come to bearranged with his wife s attendance it had so happened that sheherself was for the hour exempt from her husband s and it willat once be seen that the hour had a quality all its own when inote that remembering how the prince had looked in to say he wasgoing out the princess whimsically wondered if their respectivesposi mightn t frankly be meeting whimsically hoped indeed theywere temporarily so disposed of strange was her need atmoments to think of them as not attaching an excessiveimportance to their repudiation of the general practice that hadrested only a few weeks before on such a consecrated rightness repudiations surely were not in the air they had none of themcome to that for wasn t she at this minute testifying directlyagainst them by her own behaviour when she should confess tofear of being alone with her father to fear of what he mightthen ah with such a slow painful motion as she had a horrorof say to her then would be time enough for amerigo andcharlotte to confess to not liking to appear to foregather she had this morning a wonderful consciousness both of dreading aparticular question from him and of being able to check yes evento disconcert magnificently by her apparent manner of receivingit any restless imagination he might have about its importance the day bright and soft had the breath of summer it made themtalk to begin with of fawns of the way fawns invited maggieaware the while that in thus regarding with him the sweetnessof its invitation to one couple just as much as to another herhumbugging smile grew very nearly convulsive that was it andthere was relief truly of a sort in taking it in she washumbugging him already by absolute necessity as she had never never done in her life doing it up to the full height of whatshe had allowed for the necessity in the great dimly shiningroom where declining for his reasons to sit down he movedabout in amerigo s very footsteps the necessity affected her aspressing upon her with the very force of the charm itself of theold pleasantness between them so candidly playing up thereagain of the positive flatness of their tenderness a surfaceall for familiar use quite as if generalised from the longsuccession of tapestried sofas sweetly faded on which histheory of contentment had sat through unmeasured pauses besideher own she knew from this instant knew in advance and as wellas anything would ever teach her that she must never intermitfor a solitary second her so highly undertaking to prove thatthere was nothing the matter with her she saw of a sudden everything she might say or do in the light of that undertaking established connections from it with any number of remotematters struck herself for instance as acting all in itsinterest when she proposed their going out in the exercise oftheir freedom and in homage to the season for a turn in theregent s park this resort was close at hand at the top ofportland place and the principino beautifully better hadalready proceeded there under high attendance all of whichconsiderations were defensive for maggie all of which became toher mind part of the business of cultivating continuity upstairs while she left him to put on something to go out in the thought of his waiting below for her in possession of theempty house brought with it sharply if briefly one of herabrupt arrests of consistency the brush of a vain imaginationalmost paralysing her often for the minute before her glass the vivid look in other words of the particular differencehis marriage had made the particular difference seemed at suchinstants the loss more than anything else of their old freedom their never having had to think where they were togetherconcerned of any one of anything but each other it hadn t beenher marriage that did it that had never for three seconds suggested to either of them that they must act diplomatically must reckon with another presence no not even with herhusband s she groaned to herself while the vain imaginationlasted why did he marry ah why did he and then it came upto her more than ever that nothing could have been more beautifulthan the way in which till charlotte came so much more closelyinto their life amerigo hadn t interfered what she had gone onowing him for this mounted up again to her eyes like a columnof figures or call it even if one would a house of cards itwas her father s wonderful act that had tipped the house down andmade the sum wrong with all of which immediately after herquestion her why did he why did he rushed back inevitably the confounding the overwhelming wave of the knowledge of hisreason he did it for me he did it for me she moaned he didit exactly that our freedom meaning beloved man simply andsolely mine should be greater instead of less he did it divinely to liberate me so far as possible from caring whatbecame of him she found time upstairs even in her haste asshe had repeatedly found time before to let the wondermentsinvolved in these recognitions flash at her with their customaryeffect of making her blink the question in especial of whethershe might find her solution in acting herself in the spirit ofwhat he had done in forcing her care really to grow as muchless as he had tried to make it thus she felt the whole weightof their case drop afresh upon her shoulders was confronted unmistakably with the prime source of her haunted state it allcame from her not having been able not to mind not to mind whatbecame of him not having been able without anxiety to let himgo his way and take his risk and lead his life she had madeanxiety her stupid little idol and absolutely now while shestuck a long pin a trifle fallaciously into her hat she had with an approach to irritation told her maid a new woman whomshe had lately found herself thinking of as abysmal that shedidn t want her she tried to focus the possibility of someunderstanding between them in consequence of which he should cutloose very near indeed it looked any such possibility thatconsciousness too had taken its turn by the time she was ready all the vibration all the emotion of this present passage being precisely in the very sweetness of their lapse back into theconditions of the simpler time into a queer resemblance betweenthe aspect and the feeling of the moment and those of numberlessother moments that were sufficiently far away she had been quickin her preparation in spite of the flow of the tide thatsometimes took away her breath but a pause once more was stillleft for her to make a pause at the top of the stairs beforeshe came down to him in the span of which she asked herself ifit weren t thinkable from the perfectly practical point of view that she should simply sacrifice him she didn t go into thedetail of what sacrificing him would mean she didn t need to sodistinct was it in one of her restless lights that there he wasawaiting her that she should find him walking up and down thedrawing room in the warm fragrant air to which the open windowsand the abundant flowers contributed slowly and vaguely movingthere and looking very slight and young and superficially manageable almost as much like her child putting it a littlefreely as like her parent with the appearance about him aboveall of having perhaps arrived just on purpose to say it to her himself in so many words sacrifice me my own love dosacrifice me do sacrifice me should she want to should sheinsist on it she might verily hear him bleating it at her allconscious and all accommodating like some precious spotless exceptionally intelligent lamb the positive effect of theintensity of this figure however was to make her shake it awayin her resumed descent and after she had rejoined him after shehad picked him up she was to know the full pang of the thoughtthat her impossibility was made absolutely by hisconsciousness by the lucidity of his intention this she feltwhile she smiled there for him again all hypocritically whileshe drew on fair fresh gloves while she interrupted the processfirst to give his necktie a slightly smarter twist and then tomake up to him for her hidden madness by rubbing her nose intohis cheek according to the tradition of their frankest levity from the instant she should be able to convict him of intending every issue would be closed and her hypocrisy would have toredouble the only way to sacrifice him would be to do so withouthis dreaming what it might be for she kissed him she arrangedhis cravat she dropped remarks she guided him out she held hisarm not to be led but to lead him and taking it to her by muchthe same intimate pressure she had always used when a littlegirl to mark the inseparability of her doll she did all thesethings so that he should sufficiently fail to dream of what theymight be for xxixthere was nothing to show that her effort in any degree fellshort till they got well into the park and he struck her asgiving unexpectedly the go by to any serious search for theprincipino the way they sat down awhile in the sun was a sign ofthat his dropping with her into the first pair of sequesteredchairs they came across and waiting a little after they wereplaced as if now at last she might bring out as between them something more specific it made her but feel the more sharplyhow the specific in almost any direction was utterly forbiddenher how the use of it would be for all the world like undoingthe leash of a dog eager to follow up a scent it would come out the specific where the dog would come out would run to earth somehow the truth for she was believing herself in relation tothe truth at which she mustn t so much as indirectly point such at any rate was the fashion in which her passionateprudence played over possibilities of danger reading symptomsand betrayals into everything she looked at and yet having tomake it evident while she recognised them that she didn twince there were moments between them in their chairs when hemight have been watching her guard herself and trying to think ofsomething new that would trip her up there were pauses duringwhich with her affection as sweet and still as the sunshine shemight yet as at some hard game over a table for money havebeen defying him to fasten upon her the least little complicationof consciousness she was positively proud afterwards of thegreat style in which she had kept this up later on at thehour s end when they had retraced their steps to find amerigoand charlotte awaiting them at the house she was able to say toherself that truly she had put her plan through even thoughonce more setting herself the difficult task of making theirrelation every minute of the time not fall below the standardof that other hour in the treasured past which hung therebehind them like a framed picture in a museum a high watermarkfor the history of their old fortune the summer evening in thepark at fawns when side by side under the trees just as now they had let their happy confidence lull them with its mostgolden tone there had been the possibility of a trap for her atpresent in the very question of their taking up anew thatresidence wherefore she had not been the first to sound it inspite of the impression from him of his holding off to see whatshe would do she was saying to herself in secret can we again in this form migrate there can i for myself undertake it face all the intenser keeping up and stretching out indefinitely impossibly that our conditions in the country aswe ve established and accepted them would stand for she hadpositively lost herself in this inward doubt so much she wassubsequently to remember but remembering then too that hercompanion though perceptibly perhaps as if not to be eager hadbroken the ice very much as he had broken it in eaton squareafter the banquet to the castledeans her mind had taken a long excursion wandered far into the visionof what a summer at fawns with amerigo and charlotte still moreeminently in presence against that higher sky would bring forth wasn t her father meanwhile only pretending to talk of it justas she was in a manner pretending to listen he got off it finally at all events for the transition it couldn t well helpthrusting out at him it had amounted exactly to an arrest of herprivate excursion by the sense that he had begun to imitate oh as never yet the ancient tone of gold it had verily come fromhim at last the question of whether she thought it would be verygood but very good indeed that he should leave england for aseries of weeks on some pretext with the prince then it hadbeen that she was to know her husband s menace hadn t reallydropped since she was face to face with the effect of it ah the effect of it had occupied all the rest of their walk hadstayed out with them and come home with them besides making itimpossible that they shouldn t presently feign to recollect howrejoining the child had been their original purpose maggie suneffaced note was that it had at the end of five minutes more driven them to that endeavour as to a refuge and caused themafterwards to rejoice as well that the boy s irrepressiblyimportunate company in due course secured and enjoyed with theextension imparted by his governess a person expectant ofconsideration constituted a cover for any awkwardness for thatwas what it had all come to that the dear man had spoken to herto try her quite as he had been spoken to himself by charlotte with the same fine idea the princess took it in on the spot firmly grasping it she heard them together her father and hiswife dealing with the queer case the prince tells me thatmaggie has a plan for your taking some foreign journey with him and as he likes to do everything she wants he has suggested myspeaking to you for it as the thing most likely to make youconsent so i do speak see being always so eager myself asyou know to meet maggie s wishes i speak but without quiteunderstanding this time what she has in her head why shouldshe of a sudden at this particular moment desire to ship youoff together and to remain here alone with me the compliment sall to me i admit and you must decide quite as you like theprince is quite ready evidently to do his part but you ll haveit out with him that is you ll have it out with her somethingof that kind was what in her mind s ear maggie heard and this after his waiting for her to appeal to him directly was herfather s invitation to her to have it out well as she could sayto herself all the rest of the day that was what they did whilethey continued to sit there in their penny chairs that was whatthey had done as much as they would now ever ever have outanything the measure of this at least had been given thateach would fight to the last for the protection for theperversion of any real anxiety she had confessed instantly with her humbugging grin not flinching by a hair meeting hiseyes as mildly as he met hers she had confessed to her fancythat they might both he and his son in law have welcomed suchan escapade since they had both been so long so furiouslydomestic she had almost cocked her hat under the inspiration ofthis opportunity to hint how a couple of spirited young men reacting from confinement and sallying forth arm in arm mightencounter the agreeable in forms that would strike them for thetime at least as novel she had felt for fifty seconds with hereyes all so sweetly and falsely in her companion s horriblyvulgar yet without minding it either such luck should she haveif to be nothing worse than vulgar would see her through and ithought amerigo might like it better she had said thanwandering off alone do you mean that he won t go unless i take him she had considered here and never in her life had she consideredso promptly and so intently if she really put it that way herhusband challenged might belie the statement so that whatwould that do but make her father wonder make him perhaps askstraight out why she was exerting pressure she couldn t ofcourse afford to be suspected for an instant of exertingpressure which was why she was obliged only to make answer wouldn t that be just what you must have out with him decidedly if he makes me the proposal but he hasn t made ityet oh once more how she was to feel she had smirked perhaps he stoo shy because you re so sure he so really wants my company i think he has thought you might like it well i should but with this he looked away from her andshe held her breath to hear him either ask if she wished him toaddress the question to amerigo straight or inquire if sheshould be greatly disappointed by his letting it drop what had settled her as she was privately to call it was that he haddone neither of these things and had thereby markedly stood offfrom the risk involved in trying to draw out her reason toattenuate on the other hand this appearance and quite as if tofill out the too large receptacle made so musingly by hisabstention he had himself presently given her a reason hadpositively spared her the effort of asking whether he judgedcharlotte not to have approved he had taken everything onhimself that was what had settled her she had had to wait verylittle more to feel with this how much he was taking the pointhe made was his lack of any eagerness to put time and space onany such scale between himself and his wife he wasn t sounhappy with her far from it and maggie was to hold that he hadgrinned back paternally through his rather shielding glasses in easy emphasis of this as to be able to hint that he requiredthe relief of absence therefore unless it was for the princehimself oh i don t think it would have been for amerigo himself amerigo and i maggie had said perfectly rub on together well then there we are i see and she had again with sublime blandness assented there we are charlotte and i too her father had gaily proceeded perfectlyrub on together and then he had appeared for a little to bemaking time to put it only so he had mildly and happilyadded to put it only so he had spoken as if he might easilyput it much better yet as if the humour of contentedunderstatement fairly sufficed for the occasion he had playedthen either all consciously or all unconsciously intocharlotte s hands and the effect of this was to render treblyoppressive maggie s conviction of charlotte s plan she had donewhat she wanted his wife had which was also what amerigo hadmade her do she had kept her test maggie s test from becomingpossible and had applied instead a test of her own it wasexactly as if she had known that her stepdaughter would be afraidto be summoned to say under the least approach tocross examination why any change was desirable and it was forour young woman herself still more prodigiously as if herfather had been capable of calculations to match of judging itimportant he shouldn t be brought to demand of her what was thematter with her why otherwise with such an opportunity hadn the demanded it always from calculation that was why that waswhy he was terrified of the retort he might have invoked what my dear if you come to that is the matter with you when aminute later on he had followed up his last note by a touch ortwo designed still further to conjure away the ghost of theanomalous at that climax verily she would have had to be dumb tothe question there seems a kind of charm doesn t there on ourlife and quite as if just lately it had got itself somehowrenewed had waked up refreshed a kind of wicked selfishprosperity perhaps as if we had grabbed everything fixedeverything down to the last lovely object for the last glasscase of the last corner left over of my old show that s theonly take off that it has made us perhaps lazy a wee bitlanguid lying like gods together all careless of mankind do you consider that we re languid that form of rejoinder shehad jumped at for the sake of its pretty lightness do youconsider that we are careless of mankind living as we do in thebiggest crowd in the world and running about always pursued andpursuing it had made him think indeed a little longer than she had meant but he came up again as she might have said smiling well idon t know we get nothing but the fun do we no she had hastened to declare we certainly get nothing butthe fun we do it all he had remarked so beautifully we do it all so beautifully she hadn t denied this for amoment i see what you mean well i mean too he had gone on that we haven t no doubt enough the sense of difficulty enough enough for what enough not to be selfish i don t think you are selfish she had returned and hadmanaged not to wail it i don t say that it s me particularly or that it s you orcharlotte or amerigo but we re selfish together we move as aselfish mass you see we want always the same thing he had goneon and that holds us that binds us together we want eachother he had further explained only wanting it each time for each other that s what i call the happy spell but it salso a little possibly the immorality the immorality she had pleasantly echoed well we re tremendously moral for ourselves that is for eachother and i won t pretend that i know exactly at whoseparticular personal expense you and i for instance are happy what it comes to i daresay is that there s something haunting as if it were a bit uncanny in such a consciousness of ourgeneral comfort and privilege unless indeed he had rambled on it s only i to whom fantastically it says so much that s alli mean at any rate that it s sort of soothing as if we weresitting about on divans with pigtails smoking opium and seeingvisions let us then be up and doing what is it longfellowsays that seems sometimes to ring out like the police breakingin into our opium den to give us a shake but the beauty of itis at the same time that we are doing we re doing that is after all what we went in for we re working it our life ourchance whatever you may call it as we saw it as we felt it from the first we have worked it and what more can you do thanthat it s a good deal for me he had wound up to have madecharlotte so happy to have so perfectly contented her you froma good way back were a matter of course i mean your being allright so that i needn t mind your knowing that my greatinterest since then has rather inevitably been in making sureof the same success very much to your advantage as well forcharlotte if we ve worked our life our idea really as i say if at any rate i can sit here and say that i ve worked my shareof it it has not been what you may call least by our having putcharlotte so at her ease that has been soothing all round thathas curled up as the biggest of the blue fumes or whatever theyare of the opium don t you see what a cropper we would havecome if she hadn t settled down as she has and he had concludedby turning to maggie as for something she mightn t really havethought of you darling in that case i verily believe wouldhave been the one to hate it most to hate it maggie had wondered to hate our having with our tremendous intentions not broughtit off and i daresay i should have hated it for you even morethan for myself that s not unlikely perhaps when it was for me after all thatyou did it he had hesitated but only a moment i never told you so well charlotte herself soon enough told me but i never told her her father had answered are you very sure she had presently asked well i like to think how thoroughly i was taken with her andhow right i was and how fortunate to have that for my basis itold her all the good i thought of her then that maggie had returned was precisely part of thegood i mean it was precisely part of it that she could sobeautifully understand yes understand everything everything and in particular your reasons her telling me thatshowed me how she had understood they were face to face again now and she saw she had made hiscolour rise it was as if he were still finding in her eyes theconcrete image the enacted scene of her passage with charlotte which he was now hearing of for the first time and as to which itwould have been natural he should question her further hisforbearance to do so would but mark precisely the complicationof his fears what she does like he finally said is the wayit has succeeded your marriage yes my whole idea the way i ve been justified that s the joyi give her if for her either it had failed that however was not worth talking about he had broken off you think thenyou could now risk fawns risk it well morally from the point of view i was talking of that ofour sinking deeper into sloth our selfishness somehow seems atits biggest down there maggie had allowed him the amusement of her not taking this up is charlotte she had simply asked really ready oh if you and i and amerigo are whenever one cornerscharlotte he had developed more at his ease one finds thatshe only wants to know what we want which is what we got herfor what we got her for exactly and so for a little even thoughwith a certain effect of oddity in their more or less successfulease they left it left it till maggie made the remark that itwas all the same wonderful her stepmother should be willing before the season was out to exchange so much company for somuch comparative solitude ah he had then made answer that s because her idea i think this time is that we shall have more people more than we vehitherto had in the country don t you remember that that originally was what we were to get her for oh yes to give us a life maggie had gone through the form ofrecalling this and the light of their ancient candour shiningfrom so far back had seemed to bring out some things sostrangely that with the sharpness of the vision she had risento her feet well with a life fawns will certainly do hehad remained in his place while she looked over his head thepicture in her vision had suddenly swarmed the vibration wasthat of one of the lurches of the mystic train in which with hercompanion she was travelling but she was having to steadyherself this time before meeting his eyes she had measuredindeed the full difference between the move to fawns because eachof them now knew the others wanted it and the pairing off for ajourney of her husband and her father which nobody knew thateither wanted more company at fawns would be effectuallyenough the key in which her husband and her stepmother were atwork there was truly no question but that she and her fathermust accept any array of visitors no one could try to marry himnow what he had just said was a direct plea for that and whatwas the plea itself but an act of submission to charlotte hehad from his chair been noting her look but he had the nextminute also risen and then it was they had reminded each otherof their having come out for the boy their junction with him andwith his companion successfully effected the four had moved homemore slowly and still more vaguely yet with a vagueness thatpermitted of maggie s reverting an instant to the larger issue if we have people in the country then as you were saying doyou know for whom my first fancy would be you may be amused butit would be for the castledeans i see but why should i be amused well i mean i am myself i don t think i like her and yet ilike to see her which as amerigo says is rum but don t you feel she s very handsome her father inquired yes but it isn t for that then what is it for simply that she may be there just there before us it s as ifshe may have a value as if something may come of her i don t inthe least know what and she rather irritates me meanwhile idon t even know i admit why but if we see her often enough imay find out does it matter so very much her companion had asked while theymoved together she had hesitated you mean because you do rather like her he on his side too had waited a little but then he had taken itfrom her yes i guess i do rather like her which she accepted for the first case she could recall of theirnot being affected by a person in the same way it came backtherefore to his pretending but she had gone far enough and toadd to her appearance of levity she further observed that thoughthey were so far from a novelty she should also immediatelydesire at fawns the presence of the assinghams that puteverything on a basis independent of explanations yet it wasextraordinary at the same time how much once in the countryagain with the others she was going as they used to say athome to need the presence of the good fanny it was thestrangest thing in the world but it was as if mrs assinghammight in a manner mitigate the intensity of her consciousness ofcharlotte it was as if the two would balance one against theother as if it came round again in that fashion to her idea ofthe equilibrium it would be like putting this friend into herscale to make weight into the scale with her father and herself amerigo and charlotte would be in the other therefore it wouldtake the three of them to keep that one straight and as thisplayed all duskily in her mind it had received from her father with a sound of suddenness a luminous contribution ah rather do let s have the assinghams it would be to have them she had said as we used so much tohave them for a good long stay in the old way and on the oldterms as regular boarders fanny used to call it that is ifthey ll come as regular boarders on the old terms that s what i should liketoo but i guess they ll come her companion had added in a toneinto which she had read meanings the main meaning was that hefelt he was going to require them quite as much as she was hisrecognition of the new terms as different from the old what wasthat practically but a confession that something had happened and a perception that interested in the situation she had helpedto create mrs assingham would be by so much as this concerned in its inevitable development it amounted to anintimation off his guard that he should be thankful for someone to turn to if she had wished covertly to sound him he hadnow in short quite given himself away and if she had even atthe start needed anything more to settle her here assuredly wasenough he had hold of his small grandchild as they retracedtheir steps swinging the boy s hand and not bored as he neverwas by his always bristling like a fat little porcupine withshrill interrogation points so that secretly while they went she had wondered again if the equilibrium mightn t have been morereal mightn t above all have demanded less strange a study hadit only been on the books that charlotte should give him aprincipino of his own she had repossessed herself now of hisother arm only this time she was drawing him back gently helplessly back to what they had tried for the hour to getaway from just as he was consciously drawing the child and ashigh miss bogle on her left representing the duties of home wascomplacently drawing her the duties of home when the house inportland place reappeared showed even from a distance asvividly there before them amerigo and charlotte had come in that is amerigo had charlotte rather having come out and thepair were perched together in the balcony he bare headed shedivested of her jacket her mantle or whatever but crowned witha brilliant brave hat responsive to the balmy day which maggieimmediately spotted as new as insuperably original as worn in characteristic generous harmony for the first time all evidently to watch for the return of the absent to be there totake them over again as punctually as possible they were gay they were amused in the pleasant morning they leaned across therail and called down their greeting lighting up the front of thegreat black house with an expression that quite broke themonotony that might almost have shocked the decency of portlandplace the group on the pavement stared up as at the peopledbattlements of a castle even miss bogle who carried her headmost aloft gaped a little through the interval of space astoward truly superior beings there could scarce have been somuch of the open mouth since the dingy waits on christmas eve had so lamentably chanted for pennies the time when amerigo insatiable for english customs had come out with a gasped santissima vergine to marvel at the depositaries of thistradition and purchase a reprieve maggie s individual gape wasinevitably again for the thought of how the pair would be atwork xxxshe had not again for weeks had mrs assingham so effectuallyin presence as on the afternoon of that lady s return from theeaster party at matcham but the intermission was made up as soonas the date of the migration to fawns that of the more or lesssimultaneous adjournment of the two houses began to bediscussed it had struck her promptly that this renewal withan old friend of the old terms she had talked of with herfather was the one opening for her spirit that wouldn t toomuch advertise or betray her even her father who had always ashe would have said believed in their ancient ally wouldn tnecessarily suspect her of invoking fanny s aid toward anyspecial inquiry and least of all if fanny would only act asfanny so easily might maggie s measure of fanny s ease wouldhave been agitating to mrs assingham had it been all at oncerevealed to her as for that matter it was soon destined tobecome even on a comparatively graduated showing our youngwoman s idea in particular was that her safety her escape frombeing herself suspected of suspicion would proceed from thisfriend s power to cover to protect and as might be evenshowily to represent her represent that is her relation to theform of the life they were all actually leading this woulddoubtless be as people said a large order but that mrs assingham existed substantially or could somehow be madeprevailingly to exist for her private benefit was the finestflower maggie had plucked from among the suggestions sown likeabundant seed on the occasion of the entertainment offered inportland place to the matcham company mrs assingham thatnight rebounding from dejection had bristled with bravery andsympathy she had then absolutely she had perhaps recklessly for herself betrayed the deeper and darker consciousness animpression it would now be late for her inconsistently to attemptto undo it was with a wonderful air of giving out all thesetruths that the princess at present approached her again makingdoubtless at first a sufficient scruple of letting her know whatin especial she asked of her yet not a bit ashamed as she infact quite expressly declared of fanny s discerned foreboding ofthe strange uses she might perhaps have for her quite from thefirst really maggie said extraordinary things to her such as you can help me you know my dear when nobody else can suchas i almost wish upon my word that you had something thematter with you that you had lost your health or your money oryour reputation forgive me love so that i might be with youas much as i want or keep you with me without exciting comment without exciting any other remark than that such kindnesses are like me we have each our own way of making up for ourunselfishness and maggie who had no small self at all asagainst her husband or her father and only a weak and uncertainone as against her stepmother would verily at this crisis haveseen mrs assingham s personal life or liberty sacrificed withouta pang the attitude that the appetite in question maintained in her wasto draw peculiar support moreover from the current aspects andagitations of her victim this personage struck her in truth asready for almost anything as not perhaps effusively protesting yet as wanting with a restlessness of her own to know what shewanted and in the long run which was none so long either therewas to be no difficulty as happened about that it was as if for all the world maggie had let her see that she held her thatshe made her fairly responsible for something not to beginwith dotting all the i s nor hooking together all the links buttreating her without insistence rather with caressingconfidence as there to see and to know to advise and to assist the theory visibly had patched itself together for her that thedear woman had somehow from the early time had a hand in alltheir fortunes so that there was no turn of their commonrelations and affairs that couldn t be traced back in some degreeto her original affectionate interest on this affectionateinterest the good lady s young friend now built before her eyes very much as a wise or even as a mischievous child playingon the floor might pile up blocks skilfully and dizzily withan eye on the face of a covertly watching elder when the blocks tumbled down they but acted after the nature ofblocks yet the hour would come for their rising so high that thestructure would have to be noticed and admired mrs assingham sappearance of unreservedly giving herself involved meanwhile onher own side no separate recognitions her face of almostanxious attention was directed altogether to her young friend sso vivid felicity it suggested that she took for granted at themost certain vague recent enhancements of that state if theprincess now more than before was going and going she wasprompt to publish that she beheld her go that she had alwaysknown she would sooner or later and that any appeal forparticipation must more or less contain and invite the note oftriumph there was a blankness in her blandness assuredly andvery nearly an extravagance in her generalising gaiety aprecipitation of cheer particularly marked whenever they metagain after short separations meetings during the first flush ofwhich maggie sometimes felt reminded of other looks in otherfaces of two strangely unobliterated impressions above all thephysiognomic light that had played out in her husband at theshock she had come at last to talk to herself of the shock ofhis first vision of her on his return from matcham andgloucester and the wonder of charlotte s beautiful bold waveringgaze when the next morning in eaton square this old friend hadturned from the window to begin to deal with her if she had dared to think of it so crudely she would have saidthat fanny was afraid of her afraid of something she might sayor do even as for their few brief seconds amerigo andcharlotte had been which made exactly an expressive elementcommon to the three the difference however was that this lookhad in the dear woman its oddity of a constant renewal whereasit had never for the least little instant again peeped out of theothers other looks other lights radiant and steady with theothers had taken its place reaching a climax so short a timeago that morning of the appearance of the pair on the balcony ofher house to overlook what she had been doing with her father when their general interested brightness and beauty attuned tothe outbreak of summer had seemed to shed down warmth andwelcome and the promise of protection they were conjoined not todo anything to startle her and now at last so completely that with experience and practice they had almost ceased to feartheir liability mrs assingham on the other hand deprecatingsuch an accident not less had yet less assurance as having lesscontrol the high pitch of her cheer accordingly the tentative adventurous expressions of the would be smiling order thatpreceded her approach even like a squad of skirmishers orwhatever they were called moving ahead of the baggage train these things had at the end of a fortnight brought a dozen timesto our young woman s lips a challenge that had the cunning toawait its right occasion but of the relief of which as ademonstration she meanwhile felt no little need you ve such adread of my possibly complaining to you that you keep pealing allthe bells to drown my voice but don t cry out my dear tillyou re hurt and above all ask yourself how i can be so wicked asto complain what in the name of all that s fantastic can youdream that i have to complain of such inquiries the princesstemporarily succeeded in repressing and she did so in ameasure by the aid of her wondering if this ambiguity with whichher friend affected her wouldn t be at present a good deal likethe ambiguity with which she herself must frequently affect herfather she wondered how she should enjoy on his part such atake up as she but just succeeded from day to day in sparingmrs assingham and that made for her trying to be as easy withthis associate as mr verver blessed man all indulgent butall inscrutable was with his daughter she had extracted fromher none the less a vow in respect to the time that if thecolonel might be depended on they would spend at fawns andnothing came home to her more in this connection or inspiredher with a more intimate interest than her sense of absolutelyseeing her interlocutress forbear to observe that charlotte sview of a long visit even from such allies was there to bereckoned with fanny stood off from that proposition as visibly to the princess and as consciously to herself as she might have backed away fromthe edge of a chasm into which she feared to slip a truth thatcontributed again to keep before our young woman her own constantdanger of advertising her subtle processes that charlotte shouldhave begun to be restrictive about the assinghams which she hadnever and for a hundred obviously good reasons been before this in itself was a fact of the highest value for maggie and ofa value enhanced by the silence in which fanny herself so muchtoo unmistakably dressed it what gave it quite thrillingly itsprice was exactly the circumstance that it thus opposed her toher stepmother more actively if she was to back up her friendsfor holding out than she had ever yet been opposed though ofcourse with the involved result of the fine chance given mrs verver to ask her husband for explanations ah from the momentshe should be definitely caught in opposition there would benaturally no saying how much charlotte s opportunities mightmultiply what would become of her father she hauntedly asked if his wife on the one side should begin to press him to callhis daughter to order and the force of old habit to put it onlyat that should dispose him not less effectively to believe inthis young person at any price there she was all round imprisoned in the circle of the reasons it was impossible sheshould give certainly give him the house in the country was hishouse and thereby was charlotte s it was her own and amerigo sonly so far as its proper master and mistress should profuselyplace it at their disposal maggie felt of course that she saw nolimit to her father s profusion but this couldn t be even at thebest the case with charlotte s whom it would never be decent when all was said to reduce to fighting for her preferences there were hours truly when the princess saw herself as notunarmed for battle if battle might only take place withoutspectators this last advantage for her was however too sadly out of thequestion her sole strength lay in her being able to see that ifcharlotte wouldn t want the assinghams it would be because thatsentiment too would have motives and grounds she had all thewhile command of one way of meeting any objection any complaint on his wife s part reported to her by her father it would beopen to her to retort to his possible what are your reasons mydear by a lucidly produced what are hers love please isn tthat what we had better know mayn t her reasons be a dislike beautifully founded of the presence and thereby of theobservation of persons who perhaps know about her things it sinconvenient to her they should know that hideous card shemight in mere logic play being by this time at her stillswifter private pace intimately familiar with all the fingeredpasteboard in her pack but she could play it only on theforbidden issue of sacrificing him the issue so forbidden thatit involved even a horror of finding out if he would really haveconsented to be sacrificed what she must do she must do bykeeping her hands off him and nothing meanwhile as we see hadless in common with that scruple than such a mercilessmanipulation of their yielding beneficiaries as her spirit soboldly revelled in she saw herself in this connexion withoutdetachment saw others alone with intensity otherwise she mighthave been struck fairly have been amused by her free assignmentof the pachydermatous quality if she could face the awkwardnessof the persistence of her friends at fawns in spite of charlotte she somehow looked to them for an inspiration of courage thatwould improve upon her own they were in short not onlythemselves to find a plausibility and an audacity but weresomehow by the way to pick up these forms for her maggie aswell and she felt indeed that she was giving them scant timelonger when one afternoon in portland place she broke out withan irrelevance that was merely superficial what awfulness in heaven s name is there between them what doyou believe what do you know oh if she went by faces her visitor s sudden whiteness at this might have carried her far fanny assingham turned pale for it but there was something in such an appearance in the look it putinto the eyes that renewed maggie s conviction of what thiscompanion had been expecting she had been watching it come comefrom afar and now that it was there after all and the firstconvulsion over they would doubtless soon find themselves in amore real relation it was there because of the sunday luncheonthey had partaken of alone together it was there as strangelyas one would because of the bad weather the cold perverse junerain that was making the day wrong it was there because itstood for the whole sum of the perplexities and duplicities amongwhich our young woman felt herself lately to have picked hersteps it was there because amerigo and charlotte were againpaying together alone a week end visit which it had beenmaggie s plan infernally to promote just to see if this time they really would it was there because she had kept fanny onher side from paying one she would manifestly have been glad topay and had made her come instead stupidly vacantly boringly to luncheon all in the spirit of celebrating the fact that theprince and mrs verver had thus put it into her own power todescribe them exactly as they were it had abruptly occurred intruth that maggie required the preliminary help of determininghow they were though on the other hand before her guest hadanswered her question everything in the hour and the place everything in all the conditions affected her as crying it out her guest s stare of ignorance above all that of itself atfirst cried it out between them what do you mean anything there shouldn t be there shouldn t have been all thistime do you believe there is or what s your idea fanny s idea was clearly to begin with that her young friendhad taken her breath away but she looked at her very straightand very hard do you speak from a suspicion of your own i speak at last from a torment forgive me if it comes out i ve been thinking for months and months and i ve no one to turnto no one to help me to make things out no impression but myown don t you see to go by you ve been thinking for months and months mrs assingham tookit in but what then dear maggie have you been thinking well horrible things like a little beast that i perhaps am that there may be something something wrong and dreadful something they cover up the elder woman s colour had begun to come back she was able though with a visible effort to face the question less amazedly you imagine poor child that the wretches are in love is thatit but maggie for a minute only stared back at her help me to findout what i imagine i don t know i ve nothing but my perpetualanxiety have you any do you see what i mean if you ll tell metruly that at least one way or the other will do something forme fanny s look had taken a peculiar gravity a fulness with whichit seemed to shine is what it comes to that you re jealous ofcharlotte do you mean whether i hate her and maggie thought no noton account of father ah mrs assingham returned that isn t what one wouldsuppose what i ask is if you re jealous on account of yourhusband well said maggie presently perhaps that may be all if i munhappy i m jealous it must come to the same thing and withyou at least i m not afraid of the word if i m jealous don tyou see i m tormented she went on and all the more if i mhelpless and if i m both helpless and tormented i stuff mypocket handkerchief into my mouth i keep it there for the mostpart night and day so as not to be heard too indecentlymoaning only now with you at last i can t keep it longer i ve pulled it out and here i am fairly screaming at you they re away she wound up so they can t hear and i m by amiracle of arrangement not at luncheon with father at home ilive in the midst of miracles of arrangement half of which iadmit are my own i go about on tiptoe i watch for every sound i feel every breath and yet i try all the while to seem assmooth as old satin dyed rose colour have you ever thought ofme she asked as really feeling as i do her companion conspicuously required to be clear jealous unhappy tormented no said mrs assingham but at the sametime and though you may laugh at me for it i m bound toconfess that i ve never been so awfully sure of what i may callknowing you here you are indeed as you say such a deep littleperson i ve never imagined your existence poisoned and sinceyou wish to know if i consider that it need be i ve not theleast difficulty in speaking on the spot nothing decidedly strikes me as more unnecessary for a minute after this they remained face to face maggie hadsprung up while her friend sat enthroned and after moving toand fro in her intensity now paused to receive the light she hadinvoked it had accumulated considerably by this time roundmrs assingham s ample presence and it made even to our youngwoman s own sense a medium in which she could at last take adeeper breath i ve affected you these months and these lastweeks in especial as quiet and natural and easy but it was a question that took not imperceptibly someanswering you ve never affected me from the first hour ibeheld you as anything but in a way all your own absolutelygood and sweet and beautiful in a way as i say mrs assinghamalmost caressingly repeated just all your very own nobodyelse s at all i ve never thought of you but as outside of uglythings so ignorant of any falsity or cruelty or vulgarity asnever to have to be touched by them or to touch them i ve nevermixed you up with them there would have been time enough forthat if they had seemed to be near you but they haven t ifthat s what you want to know you ve only believed me contented then because you ve believedme stupid mrs assingham had a free smile now for the length of thisstride dissimulated though it might be in a graceful littlefrisk if i had believed you stupid i shouldn t have thought youinteresting and if i hadn t thought you interesting i shouldn thave noted whether i knew you as i ve called it or not whati ve always been conscious of is your having concealed about yousomewhere no small amount of character quite as much in fact fanny smiled as one could suppose a person of your size able tocarry the only thing was she explained that thanks to yournever calling one s attention to it i hadn t made out much moreabout it and should have been vague above all as to where youcarried it or kept it somewhere under i should simply havesaid like that little silver cross you once showed me blest bythe holy father that you always wear out of sight next yourskin that relic i ve had a glimpse of with which she continuedto invoke the privilege of humour but the precious littleinnermost say this time little golden personal nature of you blest by a greater power i think even than the pope thatyou ve never consentingly shown me i m not sure you ve everconsentingly shown it to anyone you ve been in general toomodest maggie trying to follow almost achieved a little fold of herforehead i strike you as modest to day modest when i standhere and scream at you oh your screaming i ve granted you is something new i mustfit it on somewhere the question is however mrs assinghamfurther proceeded of what the deuce i can fit it on to do youmean she asked to the fact of our friends being fromyesterday to to morrow at a place where they may more or lessirresponsibly meet she spoke with the air of putting it asbadly for them as possible are you thinking of their beingthere alone of their having consented to be and then as shehad waited without result for her companion to say but isn t ittrue that after you had this time again at the eleventh hour said you wouldn t they would really much rather not have gone yes they would certainly much rather not have gone but iwanted them to go then my dear child what in the world is the matter i wanted to see if they would and they ve had to maggieadded it was the only thing her friend appeared to wonder from the moment you and yourfather backed out oh i don t mean go for those people i mean go for us forfather and me maggie went on because now they know they know fanny assingham quavered that i ve been for some time past taking more notice notice ofthe queer things in our life maggie saw her companion for an instant on the point of askingher what these queer things might be but mrs assingham had thenext minute brushed by that ambiguous opening and taken as sheevidently felt a better one and is it for that you did it imean gave up the visit it s for that i did it to leave them to themselves as theyless and less want or at any rate less and less venture toappear to want to be left as they had for so long arrangedthings the princess went on you see they sometimes have tobe and then as if baffled by the lucidity of this mrs assingham for a little said nothing now do you think i mmodest with time however fanny could brilliantly think anything thatwould serve i think you re wrong that my dear is my answerto your question it demands assuredly the straightest i canmake i see no awfulness i suspect none i m deeplydistressed she added that you should do anything else it drew again from maggie a long look you ve never evenimagined anything ah god forbid for it s exactly as a woman of imagination thati speak there s no moment of my life at which i m not imaginingsomething and it s thanks to that darling mrs assinghampursued that i figure the sincerity with which your husband whom you see as viciously occupied with your stepmother isinterested is tenderly interested in his admirable adorablewife she paused a minute as to give her friend the full benefitof this as to maggie s measure of which however no sign came and then poor woman haplessly she crowned her effort hewouldn t hurt a hair of your head it had produced in maggie at once and apparently in theintended form of a smile the most extraordinary expression ah there it is but her guest had already gone on and i m absolutely certainthat charlotte wouldn t either it kept the princess with her strange grimace standing there no charlotte wouldn t either that s how they ve had again togo off together they ve been afraid not to lest it shoulddisturb me aggravate me somehow work upon me as i insistedthat they must that we couldn t all fail though father andcharlotte hadn t really accepted as i did this they had to yieldto the fear that their showing as afraid to move together wouldcount for them as the greater danger which would be the danger you see of my feeling myself wronged their least danger theyknow is in going on with all the things that i ve seemed toaccept and that i ve given no indication at any moment of notaccepting everything that has come up for them has come up inan extraordinary manner without my having by a sound or a signgiven myself away so that it s all as wonderful as you mayconceive they move at any rate among the dangers i speak of between that of their doing too much and that of their not havingany longer the confidence or the nerve or whatever you may callit to do enough her tone by this time might have shown astrangeness to match her smile which was still more marked asshe wound up and that s how i make them do what i like it had an effect on mrs assingham who rose with thedeliberation that from point to point marked the widening ofher grasp my dear child you re amazing amazing you re terrible maggie thoughtfully shook her head no i m not terrible andyou don t think me so i do strike you as surprising no doubt but surprisingly mild because don t you see i am mild i canbear anything oh bear mrs assingham fluted for love said the princess fanny hesitated of your father for love maggie repeated it kept her friend watching of your husband for love maggie said again it was for the moment as if the distinctness of this might havedetermined in her companion a choice between two or three highlydifferent alternatives mrs assingham s rejoinder at allevents however much or however little it was a choice waspresently a triumph speaking with this love of your own then have you undertaken to convey to me that you believe your husbandand your father s wife to be in act and in fact lovers of eachother and then as the princess didn t at first answer do youcall such an allegation as that mild oh i m not pretending to be mild to you but i ve told you andmoreover you must have seen for yourself how much so i ve beento them mrs assingham more brightly again bridled is that what youcall it when you make them for terror as you say do as youlike ah there wouldn t be any terror for them if they had nothing tohide mrs assingham faced her quite steady now are you reallyconscious love of what you re saying i m saying that i m bewildered and tormented and that i ve noone but you to speak to i ve thought i ve in fact been sure that you ve seen for yourself how much this is the case it s whyi ve believed you would meet me half way half way to what to denouncing fanny asked two persons friends of years whom i ve always immensely admired and liked and against whom i haven t the shadow of a charge to make maggie looked at her with wide eyes i had much rather youshould denounce me than denounce them denounce me denounce me she said if you can see your way it was exactly what sheappeared to have argued out with herself if conscientiously you can denounce me if conscientiously you can revile me if conscientiously you can put me in my place for a low mindedlittle pig well said mrs assingham consideringly as she paused foremphasis i think i shall be saved her friend took it for a minute however by carrying thoughtfuleyes eyes verily portentous over her head you say you ve noone to speak to and you make a point of your having so disguisedyour feelings not having as you call it given yourself away have you then never seen it not only as your right but as yourbounden duty worked up to such a pitch to speak to yourhusband i ve spoken to him said maggie mrs assingham stared ah then it isn t true that you ve madeno sign maggie had a silence i ve made no trouble i ve made no scene i ve taken no stand i ve neither reproached nor accused him you ll say there s a way in all that of being nasty enough oh dropped from fanny as if she couldn t help it but i don t think strangely enough that he regards me asnasty i think that at bottom for that is said the princess the strangeness he s sorry for me yes i think that deepwithin he pities me her companion wondered for the state you ve let yourself getinto for not being happy when i ve so much to make me so you ve everything said mrs assingham with alacrity yet sheremained for an instant embarrassed as to a further advance idon t understand however how if you ve done nothing an impatience from maggie had checked her i ve not doneabsolutely nothing but what then well she went on after a minute he knows what i ve done it produced on mrs assingham s part her whole tone and mannerexquisitely aiding a hush not less prolonged and the veryduration of which inevitably gave it something of the characterof an equal recognition and what then has he done maggie took again a minute he has been splendid splendid then what more do you want ah what you see said maggie not to be afraid it made her guest again hang fire not to be afraid really tospeak not to be afraid not to speak mrs assingham considered further you can t even to charlotte but as at this after a look at her maggie turned off with amovement of suppressed despair she checked herself and mighthave been watching her for all the difficulty and the pity ofit vaguely moving to the window and the view of the hill street it was almost as if she had had to give up from failure ofresponsive wit in her friend the last failure she had feared the hope of the particular relief she had been working for mrs assingham resumed the next instant however in the very tonethat seemed most to promise her she should have to give upnothing i see i see you would have in that case too manythings to consider it brought the princess round again provingitself thus the note of comprehension she wished most to clutchat don t be afraid maggie took it where she stood which she was soon able tosignify thank you it very properly encouraged her counsellor what your ideaimputes is a criminal intrigue carried on from day to day amidperfect trust and sympathy not only under your eyes but underyour father s that s an idea it s impossible for me for a moment to entertain ah there you are then it s exactly what i wanted from you you re welcome to it mrs assingham breathed you never have entertained it maggie pursued never for an instant said fanny with her head very high maggie took it again yet again as wanting more pardon my beingso horrid but by all you hold sacred mrs assingham faced her ah my dear upon my positive word asan honest woman thank you then said the princess so they remained a little after which but do you believe it love fanny inquired i believe you well as i ve faith in them it comes to the same thing maggie at this last appeared for a moment to think again butshe embraced the proposition the same thing then you re no longer unhappy her guest urged coming moregaily toward her i doubtless shan t be a great while but it was now mrs assingham s turn to want more i veconvinced you it s impossible she had held out her arms and maggie after a moment meetingher threw herself into them with a sound that had its oddity asa sign of relief impossible impossible she emphatically more than emphatically replied yet the next minute she hadburst into tears over the impossibility and a few seconds later pressing clinging sobbing had even caused them to flow audibly sympathetically and perversely from her friend xxxithe understanding appeared to have come to be that the coloneland his wife were to present themselves toward the middle of julyfor the good long visit at fawns on which maggie had obtainedfrom her father that he should genially insist as well as thatthe couple from eaton square should welcome there earlier in themonth and less than a week after their own arrival the adventof the couple from portland place oh we shall give you time tobreathe fanny remarked in reference to the general prospect with a gaiety that announced itself as heedless of criticism toeach member of the party in turn sustaining and bracing herselfby her emphasis pushed even to an amiable cynicism of theconfident view of these punctualities of the assinghams theground she could best occupy to her sense was that of her beingmoved as in this connexion she had always been moved by theadmitted grossness of her avidity the way the hospitality of theververs met her convenience and ministered to her ease destituteas the colonel had kept her from the first of any rusticretreat any leafy bower of her own any fixed base for the staleseason now at hand she had explained at home she had repeatedlyreexplained the terms of her dilemma the real difficulty ofher or as she now put it of their position when the paircould do nothing else in cadogan place they could still talk ofmarvellous little maggie and of the charm the sinister charm of their having to hold their breath to watch her a topic themomentous midnight discussion at which we have been present wasso far from having exhausted it came up irrepressibly at allprivate hours they had planted it there between them and itgrew from day to day in a manner to make their sense ofresponsibility almost yield to their sense of fascination mrs assingham declared at such moments that in the interest of thisadmirable young thing to whom she also declared she had quite come over she was ready to pass with all the world else evenwith the prince himself the object inconsequently as well ofher continued her explicitly shameless appreciation for avulgar indelicate pestilential woman showing her truecharacter in an abandoned old age the colonel s confessedattention had been enlisted we have seen as never yet underpressure from his wife by any guaranteed imbroglio but this she could assure him she perfectly knew was not a bit because hewas sorry for her or touched by what she had let herself in for but because when once they had been opened he couldn t keep hiseyes from resting complacently resting almost intelligently onthe princess if he was in love with her now however so muchthe better it would help them both not to wince at what theywould have to do for her mrs assingham had come back to that whenever he groaned or grunted she had at no beguiled moment since maggie s little march was positively beguiling let himlose sight of the grim necessity awaiting them we shall have as i ve again and again told you to lie for her to lie tillwe re black in the face to lie for her the colonel often at these hours as from avague vision of old chivalry in a new form wandered intoapparent lapses from lucidity to lie to her up and down and in and out it comes to the samething it will consist just as much of lying to the others too to the prince about one s belief in him to charlotte about one sbelief in her to mr verver dear sweet man about one s beliefin everyone so we ve work cut out with the biggest lie on topof all being that we like to be there for such a purpose wehate it unspeakably i m more ready to be a coward before it tolet the whole thing to let everyone selfishly andpusillanimously slide than before any social duty any felthuman call that has ever forced me to be decent i speak atleast for myself for you she had added as i ve given you soperfect an opportunity to fall in love with maggie you lldoubtless find your account in being so much nearer to her and what do you make the colonel could at this alwaysimperturbably enough ask of the account you yourself will findin being so much nearer to the prince of your confirmed if notexasperated infatuation with whom to say nothing of my weakgood nature about it you give such a pretty picture to the picture in question she had been always in fact ablecontemplatively to return the difficulty of my enjoyment ofthat is don t you see that i m making in my loyalty to maggie a sad hash of his affection for me you find means to call it then this whitewashing of his crime being loyal to maggie oh about that particular crime there is always much to say itis always more interesting to us than any other crime it has atleast that for it but of course i call everything i have in mindat all being loyal to maggie being loyal to her is more thananything else helping her with her father which is what shemost wants and needs the colonel had had it before but he could apparently never havetoo much of it helping her with him helping her against him then against what we ve already sofully talked of its having to be recognised between them that hedoubts that s where my part is so plain to see her through tosee her through to the end exaltation for the moment alwayslighted mrs assingham s reference to this plainness yet she atthe same time seldom failed the next instant to qualify herview of it when i talk of my obligation as clear i mean thatit s absolute for just how from day to day and through thickand thin to keep the thing up is i grant you another matter there s one way luckily nevertheless in which i m strong ican perfectly count on her the colonel seldom failed here as from the insidious growth ofan excitement to wonder to encourage not to see you relying to stick to me fast whatever she sees if i stick to her thatis to my own poor struggling way under providence of watchingover them all she ll stand by me to the death she won t give meaway for you know she easily can this regularly was the most lurid turn of their road but bobassingham with each journey met it as for the first time easily she can utterly dishonour me with her father she can let himknow that i was aware at the time of his marriage as i had beenaware at the time of her own of the relations that had pre existed between his wife and her husband and how can she do so if up to this minute by your ownstatement she is herself in ignorance of your knowledge it was a question that mrs assingham had ever for dealing with a manner to which repeated practice had given almost a grandeffect very much as if she was invited by it to say that aboutthis exactly she proposed to do her best lying but she said and with full lucidity something quite other it could giveitself a little the air still of a triumph over his coarseness by acting immediately with the blind resentment with which inher place ninety nine women out of a hundred would act and byso making mr verver in turn act with the same natural passion the passion of ninety nine men out of a hundred they ve only toagree about me the poor lady said they ve only to feel at oneover it feel bitterly practised upon cheated and injured they ve only to denounce me to each other as false and infamous for me to be quite irretrievably dished of course it s i whohave been and who continue to be cheated cheated by the princeand charlotte but they re not obliged to give me the benefit ofthat or to give either of us the benefit of anything they ll bewithin their rights to lump us all together as a false cruel conspiring crew and if they can find the right facts to supportthem get rid of us root and branch this on each occasion put the matter so at the worst thatrepetition even scarce controlled the hot flush with which shewas compelled to see the parts of the whole history all its uglyconsistency and its temporary gloss hang together she enjoyed invariably the sense of making her danger present of making itreal to her husband and of his almost turning pale when theireyes met at this possibility of their compromised state andtheir shared discredit the beauty was that as under a touch ofone of the ivory notes at the left of the keyboard he soundedout with the short sharpness of the dear fond stupid uneasy man conspiring so far as you were concerned to what end why to the obvious end of getting the prince a wife atmaggie s expense and then to that of getting charlotte a husbandat mr verver s of rendering friendly services yes which have produced as itturns out complications but from the moment you didn t do itfor the complications why shouldn t you have rendered them it was extraordinary for her always in this connexion how with time given him he fell to speaking better for her than shecould in the presence of her clear cut image of the worst speak for herself troubled as she was she thus never whollyfailed of her amusement by the way oh isn t what i may havemeddled for so far as it can be proved i did meddle open tointerpretation by which i mean to mr verver s and maggie s mayn t they see my motive in the light of that appreciation asthe wish to be decidedly more friendly to the others than to thevictimised father and daughter she positively liked to keep itup mayn t they see my motive as the determination to serve theprince in any case and at any price first to place himcomfortably in other words to find him his fill of money mayn tit have all the air for them of a really equivocal sinisterbargain between us something quite unholy and louche it produced in the poor colonel infallibly the echo louche love why haven t you said as much yourself haven t you put yourfinger on that awful possibility she had a way now with his felicities that made him enjoy beingreminded of them in speaking of your having always had such a mash such a mash precisely for the man i was to help to put sosplendidly at his ease a motherly mash an impartial look at itwould show it only as likely to have been but we re not talking of course about impartial looks we re talking of good innocentpeople deeply worked upon by a horrid discovery and going muchfurther in their view of the lurid as such people almost alwaysdo than those who have been wider awake all round from thefirst what i was to have got from my friend in such a view inexchange for what i had been able to do for him well that wouldhave been an equivalent of a kind best known to myself for meshrewdly to consider and she easily lost herself each time inthe anxious satisfaction of filling out the picture it wouldhave been seen it would have been heard of before the case ofthe woman a man doesn t want or of whom he s tired or for whomhe has no use but such uses and who is capable in herinfatuation in her passion of promoting his interests withother women rather than lose sight of him lose touch of him cease to have to do with him at all cela s est vu my dear andstranger things still as i needn t tell you very good then she wound up there is a perfectly possible conception of thebehaviour of your sweet wife since as i say there s noimagination so lively once it s started as that of reallyagitated lambs lions are nothing to them for lions aresophisticated are blases are brought up from the first toprowling and mauling it does give us you ll admit something tothink about my relief is luckily however in what i finally dothink he was well enough aware by this time of what she finally didthink but he was not without a sense again also for hisamusement by the way it would have made him for a spectator ofthese passages between the pair resemble not a little theartless child who hears his favourite story told for thetwentieth time and enjoys it exactly because he knows what isnext to happen what of course will pull them up if they turnout to have less imagination than you assume is the profit youcan have found in furthering mrs verver s marriage you weren tat least in love with charlotte oh mrs assingham at this always brought out my hand inthat is easily accounted for by my desire to be agreeable tohim to mr verver to the prince by preventing her in that way from taking as hewas in danger of seeing her do some husband with whom hewouldn t be able to open to keep open so large an account aswith his father in law i ve brought her near him kept herwithin his reach as she could never have remained either as asingle woman or as the wife of a different man kept her on that sweet construction to be his mistress kept her on that sweet construction to be his mistress shebrought it out grandly it had always so for her own ear as wellas visibly for her husband s its effect the facilities inthe case thanks to the particular conditions being so quiteideal down even to the facility of your minding everything so little from your own point of view as to have supplied him with theenjoyment of two beautiful women down even to that to the monstrosity of my folly but not mrs assingham added two of anything one beautiful woman and one beautiful fortune that s what a creature of pure virtueexposes herself to when she suffers her pure virtue suffers hersympathy her disinterestedness her exquisite sense for thelives of others to carry her too far voila i see it s the way the ververs have you it s the way the ververs have me it s in other words the waythey would be able to make such a show to each other of havingme if maggie weren t so divine she lets you off he never failed to insist on all this to thevery end which was how he had become so versed in what shefinally thought she lets me off so that now horrified and contrite at whati ve done i may work to help her out and mr verver she wasfond of adding lets me off too then you do believe he knows it determined in her always there with a significant pause adeep immersion in her thought i believe he would let me off ifhe did know so that i might work to help him out or rather really she went on that i might work to help maggie thatwould be his motive that would be his condition in forgivingme just as hers for me in fact her motive and her condition are my acting to spare her father but it s with maggie only thati m directly concerned nothing ever not a breath not a look i ll guarantee shall i have whatever happens from mr ververhimself so it is therefore that i shall probably by theclosest possible shave escape the penalty of my crimes you mean being held responsible i mean being held responsible my advantage will be thatmaggie s such a trump such a trump that as you say she ll stick to you stick to me on our understanding stick to me for ourunderstanding s signed and sealed and to brood over it againwas ever for mrs assingham to break out again with exaltation it s a grand high compact she has solemnly promised but in words oh yes in words enough since it s a matter of words to keepup her lie so long as i keep up mine and what do you call her lie why the pretence that she believes me believes they reinnocent she positively believes then they re guilty she has arrived atthat she s really content with it in the absence of proof it was here each time that fanny assingham most faltered butalways at last to get the matter for her own sense and with along sigh sufficiently straight it isn t a question of beliefor of proof absent or present it s inevitably with her aquestion of natural perception of insurmountable feeling sheirresistibly knows that there s something between them but shehasn t arrived at it as you say at all that s exactly whatshe hasn t done what she so steadily and intensely refuses todo she stands off and off so as not to arrive she keeps out tosea and away from the rocks and what she most wants of me is tokeep at a safe distance with her as i for my own skin only asknot to come nearer after which invariably she let him have itall so far from wanting proof which she must get in a manner by my siding with her she wants disproof as against herself and has appealed to me so extraordinarily to side against her it s really magnificent when you come to think of it the spiritof her appeal if i ll but cover them up brazenly enough theothers so as to show round and about them as happy as a bird she on her side will do what she can if i ll keep them quiet ina word it will enable her to gain time time as against any ideaof her father s and so somehow come out if i ll take care ofcharlotte in particular she ll take care of the prince andit s beautiful and wonderful really pathetic and exquisite tosee what she feels that time may do for her ah but what does she call poor little thing time well this summer at fawns to begin with she can live as yet of course but from hand to mouth but she has worked it out forherself i think that the very danger of fawns superficiallylooked at may practically amount to a greater protection therethe lovers if they are lovers will have to mind they ll feelit for themselves unless things are too utterly far gone withthem and things are not too utterly far gone with them she had inevitably poor woman her hesitation for this but sheput down her answer as for the purchase of some absolutelyindispensable article she would have put down her last shilling no it made him always grin at her is that a lie do you think you re worth lying to if it weren t the truth forme she added i wouldn t have accepted for fawns i can ibelieve keep the wretches quiet but how at the worst oh the worst don t talk about the worst i can keep themquiet at the best i seem to feel simply by our being there itwill work from week to week of itself you ll see he was willing enough to see but he desired to provide yetif it doesn t work ah that s talking about the worst well it might be but what were they doing from morning tonight at this crisis but talk who ll keep the others the others who ll keep them quiet if your couple have had a life together they can t have had it completely without witnesses without thehelp of persons however few who must have some knowledge someidea about them they ve had to meet secretly protectedly they ve had to arrange for if they haven t met and haven tarranged and haven t thereby in some quarter or other had togive themselves away why are we piling it up so therefore ifthere s evidence up and down london there must be people in possession of it ah it isn t all shealways remembered up and down london some of it must connectthem i mean she musingly added it naturally would withother places with who knows what strange adventures opportunities dissimulations but whatever there may have been it will also all have been buried on the spot oh they ve knownhow too beautifully but nothing all the same is likely tofind its way to maggie of itself because every one who may have anything to tell you hold willhave been so squared and then inveterately before she couldsay he enjoyed so much coming to this what will have squaredlady castledean the consciousness she had never lost her promptness ofhaving no stones to throw at any one else s windows she hasenough to do to guard her own glass that was what she wasdoing fanny said that last morning at matcham when all of uswent off and she kept the prince and charlotte over she helpedthem simply that she might herself be helped if it wasn tperhaps rather with her ridiculous mr blint that he might be they put in together therefore of course that day they got itclear and quite under her eyes inasmuch as they didn t becometraceable again as we know till late in the evening on thishistoric circumstance mrs assingham was always ready afresh tobrood but she was no less ready after her brooding devoutly toadd only we know nothing whatever else for which all our starsbe thanked the colonel s gratitude was apt to be less marked what did theydo for themselves all the same from the moment they got thatfree hand to the moment long after dinner time haven t you toldme of their turning up at their respective homes well it s none of your business i don t speak of it as mine but it s only too much theirs people are always traceable in england when tracings arerequired something sooner or later happens somebody sooneror later breaks the holy calm murder will out murder will but this isn t murder quite the contrary perhaps i verily believe she had her moments of adding that for theamusement of the row you would prefer an explosion this however was a remark he seldom noticed he wound up forthe most part after a long contemplative smoke with atransition from which no exposed futility in it had succeeded inweaning him what i can t for my life make out is your idea ofthe old boy charlotte s too inconceivably funny husband i have no idea i beg your pardon you ve just shown it you never speak of himbut as too inconceivably funny well he is she always confessed that is he may be for alli know too inconceivably great but that s not an idea itrepresents only my weak necessity of feeling that he s beyondme which isn t an idea either you see he may be stupid too precisely there you are yet on the other hand she always went on he may be sublime sublimer even than maggie herself he may in fact have alreadybeen but we shall never know with which her tone betrayedperhaps a shade of soreness for the single exemption she didn tyearningly welcome that i can see oh i say it came to affect the colonel himself with a senseof privation i m not sure even that charlotte will oh my dear what charlotte doesn t know but she brooded and brooded i m not sure even that the princewill it seemed privation in short for them all they ll bemystified confounded tormented but they won t know and alltheir possible putting their heads together won t make them that said fanny assingham will be their punishment and sheended ever when she had come so far at the same pitch itwill probably also if i get off with so little be mine and what her husband liked to ask will be mine nothing you re not worthy of any one s punishment is in whatone feels and what will make ours effective is that we shallfeel she was splendid with her ours she flared up with thisprophecy it will be maggie herself who will mete it out maggie she ll know about her father everything everything sherepeated on the vision of which each time mrs assingham aswith the presentiment of an odd despair turned away from it but she ll never tell us xxxiiif maggie had not so firmly made up her mind never to say eitherto her good friend or to any one else more than she meant abouther father she might have found herself betrayed into some suchoverflow during the week spent in london with her husband afterthe others had adjourned to fawns for the summer this wasbecause of the odd element of the unnatural imparted to the sosimple fact of their brief separation by the assumptions residentin their course of life hitherto she was used herself certainly by this time to dealing with odd elements but shedropped instantly even from such peace as she had patched up when it was a question of feeling that her unpenetrated parentmight be alone with them she thought of him as alone with themwhen she thought of him as alone with charlotte and this strangely enough even while fixing her sense to the full on hiswife s power of preserving quite of enhancing every felicitousappearance charlotte had done that under immeasurably fewerdifficulties indeed during the numerous months of their hymenealabsence from england the period prior to that wonderful reunionof the couples in the interest of the larger play of all thevirtues of each which was now bearing for mrs verver sstepdaughter at least such remarkable fruit it was the presentso much briefer interval in a situation possibly in a relation so changed it was the new terms of her problem that would taxcharlotte s art the princess could pull herself up repeatedly by remembering that the real relation between her father andhis wife was a thing that she knew nothing about and that instrictness was none of her business but she none the lessfailed to keep quiet as she would have called it before theprojected image of their ostensibly happy isolation nothingcould have had less of the quality of quietude than a certainqueer wish that fitfully flickered up in her a wish thatusurped perversely the place of a much more natural one ifcharlotte while she was about it could only have been worse that idea maggie fell to invoking instead of the idea that shemight desirably have been better for exceedingly odd as it wasto feel in such ways she believed she mightn t have worried somuch if she didn t somehow make her stepmother out under thebeautiful trees and among the dear old gardens as lavish offifty kinds of confidence and twenty kinds at least ofgentleness gentleness and confidence were certainly the rightthing as from a charming woman to her husband but the finetissue of reassurance woven by this lady s hands and flung overher companion as a light muffling veil formed precisely awrought transparency through which she felt her father s eyescontinually rest on herself the reach of his gaze came to herstraighter from a distance it showed him as still moreconscious down there alone of the suspected the feltelaboration of the process of their not alarming or hurting him she had herself now for weeks and weeks and all unwinkingly traced the extension of this pious effort but her perfectsuccess in giving no sign she did herself that credit wouldhave been an achievement quite wasted if mrs verver should makewith him those mistakes of proportion one set of them tooabruptly too incoherently designed to correct another set thatshe had made with his daughter however if she had been worse poor woman who should say that her husband would to acertainty have been better one groped noiselessly among such questions and it was actuallynot even definite for the princess that her own amerigo leftalone with her in town had arrived at the golden mean ofnon precautionary gallantry which would tend by his calculation to brush private criticism from its last perching place thetruth was in this connection that she had different sorts ofterrors and there were hours when it came to her that these dayswere a prolonged repetition of that night drive of weeks before from the other house to their own when he had tried to charmher by his sovereign personal power into some collapse thatwould commit her to a repudiation of consistency she was neveralone with him it was to be said without her having sooner orlater to ask herself what had already become of her consistency yet at the same time so long as she breathed no charge shekept hold of a remnant of appearance that could save her fromattack attack real attack from him as he would conduct itwas what she above all dreaded she was so far from sure thatunder that experience she mightn t drop into some depth ofweakness mightn t show him some shortest way with her that hewould know how to use again therefore since she had given him as yet no moment s pretext for pretending to her that she hadeither lost faith or suffered by a feather s weight in happiness she left him it was easy to reason with an immense advantagefor all waiting and all tension she wished him for the present to make up to her for nothing who could say to what making upmight lead into what consenting or pretending or destroyingblindness it might plunge her she loved him too helplessly still to dare to open the door by an inch to his treating heras if either of them had wronged the other something orsomebody and who at this which of them all would inevitably would in the gust of momentary selfishness be sacrificed tothat whereas what she intelligently needed was to know where shewas going knowledge knowledge was a fascination as well as afear and a part precisely of the strangeness of this juncturewas the way her apprehension that he would break out to her withsome merely general profession was mixed with her dire need toforgive him to reassure him to respond to him on no groundthat she didn t fully measure to do these things it must beclear to her what they were for but to act in that light was bythe same effect to learn horribly what the other things hadbeen he might tell her only what he wanted only what would workupon her by the beauty of his appeal and the result of thedirect appeal of any beauty in him would be her helplesssubmission to his terms all her temporary safety her hand to mouth success accordingly was in his neither perceiving nordivining this thanks to such means as she could take to preventhim take literally from hour to hour during these days of moreunbroken exposure from hour to hour she fairly expected somesign of his having decided on a jump ah yes it has been as youthink i ve strayed away i ve fancied myself free given myselfin other quantities with larger generosities because i thoughtyou were different different from what i now see but it wasonly only because i didn t know and you must admit that yougave me scarce reason enough reason enough i mean to keepclear of my mistake to which i confess for which i ll doexquisite penance which you can help me now i too beautifullyfeel to get completely over that was what while she watched herself she potentially heardhim bring out and while she carried to an end another day another sequence and yet another of their hours together withouthis producing it she felt herself occupied with him beyond eventhe intensity of surrender she was keeping her head for areason for a cause and the labour of this detachment with thelabour of her keeping the pitch of it down held them together inthe steel hoop of an intimacy compared with which artless passionwould have been but a beating of the air her greatest danger orat least her greatest motive for care was the obsession of thethought that if he actually did suspect the fruit of hisattention to her couldn t help being a sense of the growth of herimportance taking the measure with him as she had taken itwith her father of the prescribed reach of her hypocrisy shesaw how it would have to stretch even to her seeking to provethat she was not all the same important a single touch fromhim oh she should know it in case of its coming any brush ofhis hand of his lips of his voice inspired by recognition ofher probable interest as distinct from pity for her virtualgloom would hand her over to him bound hand and foot thereforeto be free to be free to act other than abjectly for herfather she must conceal from him the validity that like amicroscopic insect pushing a grain of sand she was taking oneven for herself she could keep it up with a change in sight but she couldn t keep it up forever so that really oneextraordinary effect of their week of untempered confrontation which bristled with new marks was to make her reach out inthought to their customary companions and calculate the kind ofrelief that rejoining them would bring she was learning almostfrom minute to minute to be a mistress of shades since always when there were possibilities enough of intimacy there were also by that fact in intercourse possibilities of iridescence but she was working against an adversary who was a master ofshades too and on whom if she didn t look out she shouldpresently have imposed a consciousness of the nature of theirstruggle to feel him in fact to think of his feeling himself her adversary in things of this fineness to see him at all inshort brave a name that would represent him as in opposition was already to be nearly reduced to a visible smotheringof her cry of alarm should he guess they were having in theirso occult manner a high fight and that it was she all thewhile in her supposed stupidity who had made it high and waskeeping it high in the event of his doing this before they couldleave town she should verily be lost the possible respite for her at fawns would come from the factthat observation in him there would inevitably find some ofits directness diverted this would be the case if only becausethe remarkable strain of her father s placidity might be thoughtof as likely to claim some larger part of his attention besideswhich there would be always charlotte herself to draw him off charlotte would help him again doubtless to study anything right or left that might be symptomatic but maggie could seethat this very fact might perhaps contribute in its degree toprotect the secret of her own fermentation it is not evenincredible that she may have discovered the gleam of a comfortthat was to broaden in the conceivable effect on the prince sspirit on his nerves on his finer irritability of some of thevery airs and aspects the light graces themselves of mrs verver s too perfect competence what it would most come to after all she said to herself was a renewal for him of theprivilege of watching that lady watch her very well then withthe elements after all so mixed in him how long would he go onenjoying mere spectatorship of that act for she had by this timemade up her mind that in charlotte s company he deferred tocharlotte s easier art of mounting guard wouldn t he get tired to put it only at that of seeing her always on the rampart erect and elegant with her lace flounced parasol now folded andnow shouldered march to and fro against a gold coloured east orwest maggie had gone far truly for a view of the question ofthis particular reaction and she was not incapable of pullingherself up with the rebuke that she counted her chickens beforethey were hatched how sure she should have to be of so manythings before she might thus find a weariness in amerigo sexpression and a logic in his weariness one of her dissimulated arts for meeting their tension meanwhile was to interweave mrs assingham as plausibly aspossible with the undulations of their surface to bring it aboutthat she should join them of an afternoon when they drovetogether or if they went to look at things looking at thingsbeing almost as much a feature of their life as if they werebazaar opening royalties then there were such combinations later in the day as her attendance on them and the colonel s aswell for such whimsical matters as visits to the opera no matterwho was singing and sudden outbreaks of curiosity about thebritish drama the good couple from cadogan place could alwaysunprotestingly dine with them and go on afterwards to suchpublicities as the princess cultivated the boldness of nowperversely preferring it may be said of her that during thesepassages she plucked her sensations by the way detached nervously the small wild blossoms of her dim forest so that shecould smile over them at least with the spacious appearance forher companions for her husband above all of bravely ofaltogether frivolously going a maying she had her intense hersmothered excitements some of which were almost inspirations she had in particular the extravagant positively at moments theamused sense of using her friend to the topmost notch accompanied with the high luxury of not having to explain never no never should she have to explain to fanny assingham again who poor woman on her own side would be charged it might beforever with that privilege of the higher ingenuity she put itall off on fanny and the dear thing herself might henceforthappraise the quantity more and more magnificent now in herblameless egoism maggie asked no questions of her and thus onlysignified the greatness of the opportunity she gave her shedidn t care for what devotions what dinners of their own theassinghams might have been booked that was a detail and shecould think without wincing of the ruptures and rearrangements towhich her service condemned them it all fell in beautifully moreover so that as hard at this time in spite of her fever as a little pointed diamond the princess showed something of theglitter of consciously possessing the constructive the creativehand she had but to have the fancy of presenting herself ofpresenting her husband in a certain high and convenient manner to make it natural they should go about with their gentleman andtheir lady to what else but this exactly had charlotte duringso many weeks of the earlier season worked her up herselfassuming and discharging so far as might be the character andoffice of one of those revolving subordinate presences that floatin the wake of greatness the precedent was therefore established and the group normallyconstituted mrs assingham meanwhile at table on the stairs in the carriage or the opera box might with her constantoverflow of expression for that matter and its singularlyresident character where men in especial were concerned lookacross at amerigo in whatever sense she liked it was not of thatmaggie proposed to be afraid she might warn him she mightrebuke him she might reassure him she might if it wereimpossible not to absolutely make love to him even this wasopen to her as a matter simply between them if it would helpher to answer for the impeccability he had guaranteed and maggiedesired in fact only to strike her as acknowledging the efficacyof her aid when she mentioned to her one evening a smallproject for the morrow privately entertained the idea irresistible intense of going to pay at the museum a visit tomr crichton mr crichton as mrs assingham could easilyremember was the most accomplished and obliging of publicfunctionaries whom every one knew and who knew every one whohad from the first in particular lent himself freely and forthe love of art and history to becoming one of the steadierlights of mr verver s adventurous path the custodian of one ofthe richest departments of the great national collection ofprecious things he could feel for the sincere private collectorand urge him on his way even when condemned to be present at hiscapture of trophies sacrificed by the country to parliamentarythrift he carried his amiability to the point of saying that since london under pettifogging views had to miss from time totime its rarest opportunities he was almost consoled to seesuch lost causes invariably wander at last one by one with thetormenting tinkle of their silver bells into the wondrous thealready famous fold beyond the mississippi there was a charm inhis almosts that was not to be resisted especially after mr verver and maggie had grown sure or almost again of enjoyingthe monopoly of them and on this basis of envy changed tosympathy by the more familiar view of the father and thedaughter mr crichton had at both houses though especially ineaton square learned to fill out the responsive and suggestivecharacter it was at his invitation fanny well recalled thatmaggie one day long before and under her own attendanceprecisely had for the glory of the name she bore paid a visitto one of the ampler shrines of the supreme exhibitory temple analcove of shelves charged with the gold and brown gold and ivory of old italian bindings and consecrated to the records ofthe prince s race it had been an impression that penetrated that remained yet maggie had sighed ever so prettily at itshaving to be so superficial she was to go back some day to divedeeper to linger and taste in spite of which however mrs assingham could not recollect perceiving that the visit had beenrepeated this second occasion had given way for a long time inher happy life to other occasions all testifying in theirdegree to the quality of her husband s blood its rich mixtureand its many remarkable references after which no doubt thecharming piety involved had grown on still further grounds bewildered and faint it now appeared none the less that some renewed conversationwith mr crichton had breathed on the faintness revivingly andmaggie mentioned her purpose as a conception of her very own tothe success of which she designed to devote her morning visitsof gracious ladies under his protection lighted up rosily forthis perhaps most flower loving and honey sipping member of thegreat bloomsbury hive its packed passages and cells and thoughnot sworn of the province toward which his friend had foundherself according to her appeal to him yearning again nothingwas easier for him than to put her in relation with the presidingurbanities so it had been settled maggie said to mrs assingham and she was to dispense with amerigo s company fannywas to remember later on that she had at first taken this lastfact for one of the finer notes of her young woman s detachment imagined she must be going alone because of the shade of ironythat in these ambiguous days her husband s personal presencemight be felt to confer practically on any tribute to histransmitted significance then as the next moment she felt itclear that so much plotted freedom was virtually a refinement ofreflection an impulse to commemorate afresh whatever might stillsurvive of pride and hope her sense of ambiguity happily felland she congratulated her companion on having anything soexquisite to do and on being so exquisitely in the humour to doit after the occasion had come and gone she was confirmed in heroptimism she made out in the evening that the hour spent amongthe projected lights the annals and illustrations theparchments and portraits the emblazoned volumes and the murmuredcommentary had been for the princess enlarging and inspiring maggie had said to her some days before very sweetly but veryfirmly invite us to dine please for friday and have any oneyou like or you can it doesn t in the least matter whom andthe pair in cadogan place had bent to this mandate with adocility not in the least ruffled by all that it took forgranted it provided for an evening this had been maggie s view and shelived up to her view in her friend s eyes by treating theoccasion more or less explicitly as new and strange the goodassinghams had feasted in fact at the two other boards on a scaleso disproportionate to the scant solicitations of their own thatit was easy to make a joke of seeing how they fed at home howthey met themselves the question of giving to eat maggie dinedwith them in short and arrived at making her husband appear todine much in the manner of a pair of young sovereigns who have in the frolic humour of the golden years of reigns proposedthemselves to a pair of faithfully serving subjects she showedan interest in their arrangements an inquiring tenderness almostfor their economies so that her hostess not unnaturally as theymight have said put it all down the tone and the freedom ofwhich she set the example to the effect wrought in her afresh byone of the lessons learned in the morning at the altar of thepast hadn t she picked it up from an anecdote or two offeredagain to her attention that there were for princesses of such aline more ways than one of being a heroine maggie s wayto night was to surprise them all truly by the extravagance ofher affability she was doubtless not positively boisterous yet though mrs assingham as a bland critic had never doubted herbeing graceful she had never seen her put so much of it intobeing what might have been called assertive it was all a tune towhich fanny s heart could privately palpitate her guest washappy happy as a consequence of something that had occurred butshe was making the prince not lose a ripple of her laugh thoughnot perhaps always enabling him to find it absolutely notfoolish foolish in public beyond a certain point he wasscarce the man to brook his wife s being thought to be so thatthere hovered before their friend the possibility of somesubsequent scene between them in the carriage or at home ofslightly sarcastic inquiry of promptly invited explanation ascene that according as maggie should play her part in it mightor might not precipitate developments what made theseappearances practically thrilling meanwhile was this mystery amystery it was clear to amerigo himself of the incident or theinfluence that had so peculiarly determined them the lady of cadogan place was to read deeper however withinthree days and the page was turned for her on the eve of heryoung confidant s leaving london the awaited migration to fawnswas to take place on the morrow and it was known meanwhile tomrs assingham that their party of four were to dine that night at the american embassy with another and a larger party so thatthe elder woman had a sense of surprise on receiving from theyounger under date of six o clock a telegram requesting herimmediate attendance please come to me at once dress early ifnecessary so that we shall have time the carriage ordered forus will take you back first mrs assingham on quickdeliberation dressed though not perhaps with full lucidity andby seven o clock was in portland place where her friend upstairs and described to her on her arrival as herself engagedin dressing instantly received her she knew on the spot poorfanny as she was afterwards to declare to the colonel that herfeared crisis had popped up as at the touch of a spring that herimpossible hour was before her her impossible hour was the hourof its coming out that she had known of old so much more than shehad ever said and she had often put it to herself inapprehension she tried to think even in preparation that sheshould recognise the approach of her doom by a consciousness akinto that of the blowing open of a window on some night of thehighest wind and the lowest thermometer it would be all in vainto have crouched so long by the fire the glass would have beensmashed the icy air would fill the place if the air in maggie sroom then on her going up was not as yet quite the polarblast she had expected it was distinctly none the less such anatmosphere as they had not hitherto breathed together theprincess she perceived was completely dressed that businesswas over it added indeed to the effect of her importantlyawaiting the assistance she had summoned of her showing a deckcleared so to speak for action her maid had already left her and she presented herself in the large clear room whereeverything was admirable but where nothing was out of place as for the first time in her life rather bedizened was it thatshe had put on too many things overcharged herself with jewels wore in particular more of them than usual and bigger ones inher hair a question her visitor presently answered byattributing this appearance largely to the bright red spot redas some monstrous ruby that burned in either of her cheeks these two items of her aspect had promptly enough their ownlight for mrs assingham who made out by it that nothing morepathetic could be imagined than the refuge and disguise heragitation had instinctively asked of the arts of dress multiplied to extravagance almost to incoherence she had had visibly her idea that of not betraying herself by inattentionsinto which she had never yet fallen and she stood there circledabout and furnished forth as always in a manner that testifiedto her perfect little personal processes it had ever been hersign that she was for all occasions found ready without looseends or exposed accessories or unremoved superfluities asuggestion of the swept and garnished in her whole splendid yetthereby more or less encumbered and embroidered setting thatreflected her small still passion for order and symmetry forobjects with their backs to the walls and spoke even of someprobable reference in her american blood to dusting andpolishing new england grandmothers if her apartment was princely in the clearness of the lingering day she looked asif she had been carried there prepared all attired anddecorated like some holy image in a procession and left precisely to show what wonder she could work under pressure herfriend felt how could she not as the truly pious priest mightfeel when confronted behind the altar before the festa withhis miraculous madonna such an occasion would be grave ingeneral with all the gravity of what he might look for but thegravity to night would be of the rarest what he might look forwould depend so on what he could give xxxiii something very strange has happened and i think you ought toknow it maggie spoke this indeed without extravagance yet with theeffect of making her guest measure anew the force of her appeal it was their definite understanding whatever fanny knew fanny sfaith would provide for and she knew accordingly at the end offive minutes what the extraordinary in the late occurrence hadconsisted of and how it had all come of maggie s achieved hour under mr crichton s protection at the museum he had desired mr crichton with characteristic kindness after the wonderfulshow after offered luncheon at his incorporated lodge hard by to see her safely home especially on his noting in attendingher to the great steps that she had dismissed her carriage which she had done really just for the harmless amusement oftaking her way alone she had known she should find herself asthe consequence of such an hour in a sort of exalted state under the influence of which a walk through the london streetswould be exactly what would suit her best an independent ramble impressed excited contented with nothing to mind and nobody totalk to and shop windows in plenty to look at if she liked alow taste of the essence it was to be supposed of her nature that she had of late for so many reasons been unable togratify she had taken her leave with her thanks she knew herway quite enough it being also sufficiently the case that shehad even a shy hope of not going too straight to wander a littlewild was what would truly amuse her so that keeping clear ofoxford street and cultivating an impression as of parts shedidn t know she had ended with what she had more or less hadbeen fancying an encounter with three or four shops an oldbookseller s an old printmonger s a couple of places with dimantiquities in the window that were not as so many of the othershops those in sloane street say a hollow parade which hadlong since ceased to beguile there had remained with hermoreover an allusion of charlotte s of some months before seeddropped into her imagination in the form of a casual speech aboutthere being in bloomsbury such funny little fascinating placesand even sometimes such unexpected finds there could perhapshave been no stronger mark than this sense of well nigh romanticopportunity no livelier sign of the impression made on her andalways so long retained so watchfully nursed by any observationof charlotte s however lightly thrown off and then she hadfelt somehow more at her ease than for months and monthsbefore she didn t know why but her time at the museum oddly had done it it was as if she hadn t come into so many noble andbeautiful associations nor secured them also for her boy secured them even for her father only to see them turn to vanityand doubt turn possibly to something still worse i believed inhim again as much as ever and i felt how i believed in him shesaid with bright fixed eyes i felt it in the streets as iwalked along and it was as if that helped me and lifted me up my being off by myself there not having for the moment towonder and watch having on the contrary almost nothing on mymind it was so much as if everything would come out right that she hadfallen to thinking of her father s birthday had given herselfthis as a reason for trying what she could pick up for it theywould keep it at fawns where they had kept it before since itwould be the twenty first of the month and she mightn t haveanother chance of making sure of something to offer him therewas always the impossibility of course of finding him anything the least bit good that he wouldn t already long ago in hisrummagings have seen himself and only not to think a quartergood enough this however was an old story and one could nothave had any fun with him but for his sweet theory that theindividual gift the friendship s offering was by a rigorouslaw of nature a foredoomed aberration and that the more it wasso the more it showed and the more one cherished it for showing how friendly it had been the infirmity of art was the candour ofaffection the grossness of pedigree the refinement of sympathy the ugliest objects in fact as a general thing were thebravest the tenderest mementos and as such figured in glasscases apart worthy doubtless of the home but not worthy of thetemple dedicated to the grimacing not to the clear faced gods she herself naturally through the past years had come to bemuch represented in those receptacles against the thick lockedpanes of which she still liked to flatten her nose finding inits place each time everything she had on successiveanniversaries tried to believe he might pretend at hersuggestion to be put off with or at least think curious shewas now ready to try it again they had always with his pleasurein her pretence and her pleasure in his with the funny betrayalof the sacrifice to domestic manners on either side played thegame so happily to this end on her way home she had loiteredeverywhere quite too deludedly among the old books and the oldprints which had yielded nothing to her purpose but with astrange inconsequence in one of the other shops that of a smallantiquarian a queer little foreign man who had shown her anumber of things shown her finally something that struck withit as rather a rarity and thinking it would compared to some ofher ventures quite superlatively do she had bought boughtreally when it came to that for a price it appears now itwon t do at all said maggie something has happened since thatputs it quite out of the question i had only my day ofsatisfaction in it but i feel at the same time as i keep ithere before me that i wouldn t have missed it for the world she had talked from the first of her friend s entrancescoherently enough even with a small quaver that overstated hercalm but she held her breath every few seconds as if fordeliberation and to prove she didn t pant all of which markedfor fanny the depth of her commotion her reference to herthought about her father about her chance to pick up somethingthat might divert him her mention in fine of his fortitudeunder presents having meanwhile naturally it should be said much less an amplitude of insistence on the speaker s lips than apower to produce on the part of the listener herself the promptresponse and full comprehension of memory and sympathy of oldamused observation the picture was filled out by the latter sfond fancy but maggie was at any rate under arms she knew whatshe was doing and had already her plan a plan for making forallowing as yet no difference in accordance with which shewould still dine out and not with red eyes nor convulsedfeatures nor neglected items of appearance nor anything thatwould raise a question yet there was some knowledge that exactly to this support of her not breaking down she desired she required possession of and with the sinister rise and fallof lightning unaccompanied by thunder it played before mrs assingham s eyes that she herself should have at whatever riskor whatever cost to supply her with the stuff of her need allour friend s instinct was to hold off from this till she shouldsee what the ground would bear she would take no step nearerunless intelligibly to meet her and awkward though it might beto hover there only pale and distorted with mere imbecilities ofvagueness there was a quality of bald help in the fact of not asyet guessing what such an ominous start could lead to shecaught however after a second s thought at the princess sallusion to her lost reassurance you mean you were so at your ease on monday the night you dinedwith us i was very happy then said maggie yes we thought you so gay and so brilliant fanny felt itfeeble but she went on we were so glad you were happy maggie stood a moment at first only looking at her you thoughtme all right eh surely dearest we thought you all right well i daresay it was natural but in point of fact i never wasmore wrong in my life for all the while if you please thiswas brewing mrs assingham indulged as nearly as possible to luxury hervagueness this that replied the princess whose eyes her companion now saw had turned to an object on the chimney piece of the room ofwhich among so many precious objects the ververs wherever theymight be always revelled peculiarly in matchless old mantelornaments her visitor had not taken heed do you mean the gilt cup i mean the gilt cup the piece now recognised by fanny as new to her own vision was acapacious bowl of old looking rather strikingly yellow gold mounted by a short stem on an ample foot which held a centralposition above the fire place where to allow it the better toshow a clearance had been made of other objects notably of thelouis seize clock that accompanied the candelabra this lattertrophy ticked at present on the marble slab of a commode thatexactly matched it in splendour and style mrs assingham tookit the bowl as a fine thing but the question was obviously notof its intrinsic value and she kept off from it admiring it ata distance but what has that to do it has everything you ll see with which again however forthe moment maggie attached to her strange wide eyes he knewher before before i had ever seen him he knew but fanny while she cast about her for the linksshe missed could only echo it amerigo knew charlotte more than i ever dreamed fanny felt then it was stare for stare but surely you alwaysknew they had met i didn t understand i knew too little don t you see what imean the princess asked mrs assingham wondered during these instants how much she evennow knew it had taken a minute to perceive how gently she wasspeaking with that perception of its being no challenge ofwrath no heat of the deceived soul but only a free exposure ofthe completeness of past ignorance inviting derision even if itmust the elder woman felt first a strange barely crediblerelief she drew in as if it had been the warm summer scent of aflower the sweet certainty of not meeting any way she shouldturn any consequence of judgment she shouldn t be judged saveby herself which was her own wretched business the next moment however at all events she blushed within for her immediatecowardice she had thought of herself thought of getting off before so much as thinking that is of pitifully seeing that shewas in presence of an appeal that was all an appeal that utterlyaccepted its necessity in a general way dear child yes butnot a in connexion with what you ve been telling me they were intimate you see intimate said the princess fanny continued to face her taking from her excited eyes thishistory so dim and faint for all her anxious emphasis of thefar away other time there s always the question of what oneconsiders what one considers intimate well i know what i considerintimate now too intimate said maggie to let me knowanything about it it was quiet yes but not too quiet for fanny assingham scapacity to wince only compatible with letting me you mean she had asked it after a pause but turning again to the newornament of the chimney and wondering even while she took relieffrom it at this gap in her experience but here are things mydear of which my ignorance is perfect they went about together they re known to have done it and idon t mean only before i mean after after said fanny assingham before we were married yes but after we were engaged ah i ve known nothing about that and she said it with abraver assurance clutching with comfort at something that wasapparently new to her that bowl maggie went on is so strangely too strangely almost to believe at this time of day the proof they weretogether all the while up to the very eve of our marriage don tyou remember how just before that she came back so unexpectedly from america the question had for mrs assingham and whether all consciouslyor not the oddest pathos of simplicity oh yes dear of coursei remember how she came back from america and how she stayedwith us and what view one had of it maggie s eyes still all the time pressed and penetrated sothat during a moment just here she might have given the littleflare have made the little pounce of asking what then one s view had been to the small flash of this eruption fanny stood for her minute wittingly exposed but she saw it as quicklycease to threaten quite saw the princess even though in all herpain refuse in the interest of their strange and exaltedbargain to take advantage of the opportunity for planting thestab of reproach the opportunity thus coming all of itself shesaw her or she believed she saw her look at her chance forstraight denunciation look at it and then pass it by and shefelt herself with this fact hushed well nigh to awe at thelucid higher intention that no distress could confound and thatno discovery since it was however obscurely a case of discovery could make less needful these seconds were brief they rapidly passed but they lasted long enough to renew ourfriend s sense of her own extraordinary undertaking the functionagain imposed on her the answerability again drilled into her by this intensity of intimation she was reminded of the terms onwhich she was let off her quantity of release having made itssufficient show in that recall of her relation to charlotte s oldreappearance and deep within the whole impression glowed ah soinspiringly when it came to that her steady view clear from thefirst of the beauty of her companion s motive it was like afresh sacrifice for a larger conquest only see me through now do it in the face of this and in spite of it and i leave you ahand of which the freedom isn t to be said the aggravation offear or call it apparently of knowledge had jumped straightinto its place as an aggravation above all for her father theeffect of this being but to quicken to passion her reasons formaking his protectedness or in other words the forms of hisignorance still the law of her attitude and the key to hersolution she kept as tight hold of these reasons and theseforms in her confirmed horror as the rider of a plunging horsegrasps his seat with his knees and she might absolutely havebeen putting it to her guest that she believed she could stay onif they should only meet nothing more though ignorant still ofwhat she had definitely met fanny yearned within over herspirit and so no word about it said passed through merepitying eyes a vow to walk ahead and at crossroads with alantern for the darkness and wavings away for unadvised traffic look out for alarms there was accordingly no wait in maggie sreply they spent together hours spent at least a morning thecertainty of which has come back to me now but that i didn tdream of it at the time that cup there has turned witness bythe most wonderful of chances that s why since it has beenhere i ve stood it out for my husband to see put it where itwould meet him almost immediately if he should come into theroom i ve wanted it to meet him she went on and i ve wantedhim to meet it and to be myself present at the meeting but thathasn t taken place as yet often as he has lately been in the wayof coming to see me here yes in particular lately he hasn tshowed to day it was with her managed quietness more and more that she talked an achieved coherence that helped her evidently to hear and to watch herself there was support andthereby an awful harmony but which meant a further guidance inthe facts she could add together it s quite as if he had aninstinct something that has warned him off or made him uneasy he doesn t quite know naturally what has happened but guesses with his beautiful cleverness that something has and isn t in ahurry to be confronted with it so in his vague fear he keepsoff but being meanwhile in the house i ve no idea not having seen him to day by exception sincebefore luncheon he spoke to me then the princess freelyexplained of a ballot of great importance at a club forsomebody some personal friend i think who s coming up and issupposed to be in danger to make an effort for him he thought hehad better lunch there you see the efforts he can make forwhich maggie found a smile that went to her friend s heart he sin so many ways the kindest of men but it was hours ago mrs assingham thought the more danger then of his coming inand finding me here i don t know you see what you now considerthat you ve ascertained nor anything of the connexion with it ofthat object that you declare so damning her eyes rested on thisodd acquisition and then quitted it went back to it and againturned from it it was inscrutable in its rather stupid elegance and yet from the moment one had thus appraised it vivid anddefinite in its domination of the scene fanny could no moreoverlook it now than she could have overlooked a lightedchristmas tree but nervously and all in vain she dipped into hermind for some floating reminiscence of it at the same time thatthis attempt left her blank she understood a good deal she evennot a little shared the prince s mystic apprehension the goldenbowl put on under consideration a sturdy a consciousperversity as a document somehow it was ugly though itmight have a decorative grace his finding me here in presenceof it might be more flagrantly disagreeable for all of us thanyou intend or than would necessarily help us and i must taketime truly to understand what it means you re safe as far as that goes maggie returned you maytake it from me that he won t come in and that i shall only findhim below waiting for me when i go down to the carriage fanny assingham took it from her took it and more we re to sittogether at the ambassador s then or at least you two are withthis new complication thrust up before you all unexplained andto look at each other with faces that pretend for the ghastlyhour not to be seeing it maggie looked at her with a face that might have been the one shewas preparing unexplained my dear quite the contrary explained fully intensely admirably explained with nothingreally to add my own love she kept it up i don t wantanything more i ve plenty to go upon and to do with as it is fanny assingham stood there in her comparative darkness with herlinks verily still missing but the most acceptable effect ofthis was singularly as yet a cold fear of getting nearer thefact but when you come home i mean he ll come up with youagain won t he see it then on which maggie gave her after an instant s visible thought thestrangest of slow headshakes i don t know perhaps he ll neversee it if it only stands there waiting for him he may neveragain said the princess come into this room fanny more deeply wondered never again oh yes it may be how do i know with this she quietly went on she had not looked again at the incriminating piece but therewas a marvel to her friend in the way the little wordrepresenting it seemed to express and include for her the wholeof her situation then you intend not to speak to him maggie waited to speak well about your having it and about what you consider that itrepresents oh i don t know that i shall speak if he doesn t but hiskeeping away from me because of that what will that be but tospeak he can t say or do more it won t be for me to speak maggie added in a different tone one of the tones that hadalready so penetrated her guest it will be for me to listen mrs assingham turned it over then it all depends on thatobject that you regard for your reasons as evidence i think i may say that i depend on it i can t said maggie treat it as nothing now mrs assingham at this went closer to the cup on the chimney quite liking to feel that she did so moreover without goingcloser to her companion s vision she looked at the preciousthing if precious it was found herself in fact eyeing it as if by her dim solicitation to draw its secret from it rather thansuffer the imposition of maggie s knowledge it was brave andrich and firm with its bold deep hollow and without this queertorment about it would thanks to her love of plenty of yellow figure to her as an enviable ornament a possession reallydesirable she didn t touch it but if after a minute she turnedaway from it the reason was rather oddly and suddenly in herfear of doing so then it all depends on the bowl i mean yourfuture does for that s what it comes to i judge what it comes to maggie presently returned is what thatthing has put me so almost miraculously in the way of learning how far they had originally gone together if there was so muchbetween them before there can t with all the otherappearances not be a great deal more now and she went on andon she steadily made her points if such things were alreadythen between them they make all the difference for possible doubtof what may have been between them since if there had beennothing before there might be explanations but it makes to daytoo much to explain i mean to explain away she said fanny assingham was there to explain away of this she was dulyconscious for that at least had been true up to now in thelight however of maggie s demonstration the quantity evenwithout her taking as yet a more exact measure might well seemlarger than ever besides which with or without exactness theeffect of each successive minute in the place was to put her morein presence of what maggie herself saw maggie herself saw thetruth and that was really while they remained there together enough for mrs assingham s relation to it there was a force inthe princess s mere manner about it that made the detail of whatshe knew a matter of minor importance fanny had in factsomething like a momentary shame over her own need of asking forthis detail i don t pretend to repudiate she said after alittle my own impressions of the different times i suppose youspeak of any more she added than i can forget whatdifficulties and as it constantly seemed to me what dangers every course of action whatever i should decide upon made forme i tried i tried hard to act for the best and you know she next pursued while at the sound of her own statement aslow courage and even a faint warmth of conviction came back toher and you know i believe it s what i shall turn out to havedone this produced a minute during which their interchange thoughquickened and deepened was that of silence only and the long charged look all of which found virtual consecration when maggieat last spoke i m sure you tried to act for the best it kept fanny assingham again a minute in silence i neverthought dearest you weren t an angel not however that this alone was much help it was up to thevery eve you see the princess went on up to within two orthree days of our marriage that that you know and shebroke down for strangely smiling yes as i say it was while she was with me but i didn t knowit that is said fanny assingham i didn t know of anything inparticular it sounded weak that she felt but she had reallyher point to make what i mean is that i don t know forknowledge now anything i didn t then that s how i am shestill however floundered i mean it s how i was but don t they how you were and how you are maggie asked come practically to the same thing the elder woman s words hadstruck her own ear as in the tone now mistimed of their recent but all too factitious understanding arrived at in hours when as there was nothing susceptible of proof there was nothingdefinitely to disprove the situation had changed by well bywhatever there was by the outbreak of the definite and thiscould keep maggie at least firm she was firm enough as shepursued it was on the whole thing that amerigo married me with which her eyes had their turn again at her damnatory piece and it was on that it was on that but they came back to hervisitor and it was on it all that father married her her visitor took it as might be they both married ah that youmust believe with the highest intentions father did certainly and then at the renewal of thisconsciousness it all rolled over her ah to thrust such thingson us to do them here between us and with us day after day andin return in return to do it to him to him to him fanny hesitated you mean it s for him you most suffer andthen as the princess after a look but turned away moving aboutthe room which made the question somehow seem a blunder iask she continued because i think everything everything wenow speak of may be for him really may be made for him quiteas if it hadn t been but maggie had the next moment faced about as if without hearingher father did it for me did it all and only for me mrs assingham with a certain promptness threw up her head butshe faltered again before she spoke well it was only an intended word but maggie showed after an instantthat it had reached her do you mean that that s the reason that that s a reason fanny at first however feeling the response in this didn t sayall she meant she said for the moment something else instead he did it for you largely at least for you and it was for youthat i did in my smaller interested way well what i could do for i could do something she continued i thought i saw yourinterest as he himself saw it and i thought i saw charlotte s ibelieved in her and i believed in her said maggie mrs assingham waited again but she presently pushed on shebelieved then in herself ah maggie murmured something exquisite faintly eager in the prompt simplicity ofit supported her friend further and the prince believed hisbelief was real just as he believed in himself maggie spent a minute in taking it from her he believed inhimself just as i too believed in him for i absolutely did maggie to which fanny then added and i believe in him yet i mean she subjoined well i mean i do maggie again took it from her after which she was again restlessly set afloat then when this had come to an end anddo you believe in charlotte yet mrs assingham had a demur that she felt she could now afford we ll talk of charlotte some other day they both at any rate thought themselves safe at the time then why did they keep from me everything i might have known her friend bent upon her the mildest eyes why did i myself keepit from you oh you weren t for honour obliged dearest maggie the poor woman broke out on this you aredivine they pretended to love me the princess went on and theypretended to love him and pray what was there that i didn t pretend not at any rate to care for me as you cared for amerigo andfor charlotte they were much more interesting it was perfectlynatural how couldn t you like amerigo maggie continued mrs assingham gave it up how couldn t i how couldn t i then with a fine freedom she went all her way how can t i how can t i it fixed afresh maggie s wide eyes on her i see i see well it s beautiful for you to be able to and of course she added you wanted to help charlotte yes fanny considered it i wanted to help charlotte but iwanted also you see to help you by not digging up a past thati believed with so much on top of it solidly buried i wanted as i still want she richly declared to help every one it set maggie once more in movement movement which however spent itself again with a quick emphasis then it s a good dealmy fault if everything really began so well fanny assingham met it as she could you ve been only tooperfect you ve thought only too much but the princess had already caught at the words yes i vethought only too much yet she appeared to continue for theminute full of that fault she had it in fact by this promptedthought all before her of him dear man of him her friend able to take in thus directly her vision of herfather watched her with a new suspense that way might safetylie it was like a wider chink of light he believed with abeauty in charlotte yes and it was i who had made him believe i didn t mean to atthe time so much for i had no idea then of what was coming buti did it i did it the princess declared with a beauty ah with a beauty you too mrs assinghaminsisted maggie however was seeing for herself it was another matter the thing was that he made her think it would be so possible fanny again hesitated the prince made her think maggie stared she had meant her father but her vision seemed tospread they both made her think she wouldn t have thoughtwithout them yet amerigo s good faith mrs assingham insisted wasperfect and there was nothing all the more she added against your father s the remark however kept maggie for a moment still nothingperhaps but his knowing that she knew knew that he was doing it so much for me to what extent shesuddenly asked of her friend do you think he was aware that sheknew ah who can say what passes between people in such a relation the only thing one can be sure of is that he was generous andmrs assingham conclusively smiled he doubtless knew as much aswas right for himself as much that is as was right for her yes then as was right for her the point is fanny declared that whatever his knowledge it made all the way it went forhis good faith maggie continued to gaze and her friend now fairly waited on hersuccessive movements isn t the point very considerably thathis good faith must have been his faith in her taking almost asmuch interest in me as he himself took fanny assingham thought he recognised he adopted your longfriendship but he founded on it no selfishness no said maggie with still deeper consideration he countedher selfishness out almost as he counted his own so you may say very well maggie went on if he had none of his own heinvited her may have expected her on her side to have aslittle and she may only since have found that out mrs assingham looked blank since and he may have become aware maggie pursued that she hasfound it out that she has taken the measure since theirmarriage she explained of how much he had asked of her more say than she had understood at the time he may have made out atlast how such a demand was in the long run to affect her he may have done many things mrs assingham responded butthere s one thing he certainly won t have done he ll never haveshown that he expected of her a quarter as much as she must haveunderstood he was to give i ve often wondered maggie mused what charlotte reallyunderstood but it s one of the things she has never told me then as it s one of the things she has never told me either weshall probably never know it and we may regard it as none of ourbusiness there are many things said mrs assingham that weshall never know maggie took it in with a long reflection never but there are others her friend went on that stare us in theface and that under whatever difficulty you may feel youlabour may now be enough for us your father has beenextraordinary it had been as if maggie were feeling her way but she rallied tothis with a rush extraordinary magnificent said fanny assingham her companion held tight to it magnificent then he ll do for himself whatever there may be to do what heundertook for you he ll do to the end he didn t undertake it tobreak down in what quiet patient exquisite as he is did heever break down he had never in his life proposed to himself tohave failed and he won t have done it on this occasion ah this occasion and maggie s wail showed her of a sudden thrown back on it am i in the least sure that with everything he even knows what it is and yet am i in the least sure hedoesn t if he doesn t then so much the better leave him alone do you mean give him up leave her fanny assingham went on leave her to him maggie looked at her darkly do you mean leave him to her afterthis after everything aren t they for that matter intimatelytogether now intimately how do i know but fanny kept it up aren t you and your husband in spite ofeverything maggie s eyes still further if possible dilated it remains tobe seen if you re not then where s your faith in my husband mrs assingham but for an instant hesitated in your father itall comes back to that rest on it on his ignorance fanny met it again on whatever he may offer you take that take it maggie stared mrs assingham held up her head and be grateful on which fora minute she let the princess face her do you see i see said maggie at last then there you are but maggie had turned away moving to thewindow as if still to keep something in her face from sight shestood there with her eyes on the street while mrs assingham sreverted to that complicating object on the chimney as to whichher condition so oddly even to herself was that both ofrecurrent wonder and recurrent protest she went over it lookedat it afresh and yielded now to her impulse to feel it in herhands she laid them on it lifting it up and was surprised thus with the weight of it she had seldom handled so muchmassive gold that effect itself somehow prompted her to furtherfreedom and presently to saying i don t believe in this youknow it brought maggie round to her don t believe in it you willwhen i tell you ah tell me nothing i won t have it said mrs assingham shekept the cup in her hand held it there in a manner that gavemaggie s attention to her she saw the next moment a quality ofexcited suspense this suggested to her oddly that she had with the liberty she was taking an air of intention and theimpression betrayed by her companion s eyes grew more distinct ina word of warning it s of value but its value s impaired i velearned by a crack a crack in the gold it isn t gold with which somewhat strangely maggie smiled that s the point what is it then it s glass and cracked under the gilt as i say at that glass of this weight well said maggie it s crystal and was once i suppose precious but what she then asked do you mean to do with it she had come away from her window one of the three by which thewide room enjoying an advantageous back commanded the westernsky and caught a glimpse of the evening flush while mrs assingham possessed of the bowl and possessed too of thisindication of a flaw approached another for the benefit of theslowly fading light here thumbing the singular piece weighingit turning it over and growing suddenly more conscious aboveall of an irresistible impulse she presently spoke again acrack then your whole idea has a crack maggie by this time at some distance from her waited a moment if you mean by my idea the knowledge that has come to me that but fanny with decision had already taken her up there s onlyone knowledge that concerns us one fact with which we can haveanything to do which one then the fact that your husband has never never never but thevery gravity of this statement while she raised her eyes to herfriend across the room made her for an instant hang fire well never what never been half so interested in you as now but don t you mydear really feel it maggie considered oh i think what i ve told you helps me tofeel it his having to day given up even his forms his keepingaway from me his not having come and she shook her head asagainst all easy glosses it is because of that you know well then if it s because of this and fanny assingham whohad been casting about her and whose inspiration decidedly hadcome raised the cup in her two hands raised it positively aboveher head and from under it solemnly smiled at the princess asa signal of intention so for an instant full of her thought andof her act she held the precious vessel and then with due notetaken of the margin of the polished floor bare fine and hard inthe embrasure of her window she dashed it boldly to the ground where she had the thrill of seeing it with the violence of thecrash lie shattered she had flushed with the force of hereffort as maggie had flushed with wonder at the sight and thishigh reflection in their faces was all that passed between themfor a minute more after which whatever you meant by it and idon t want to know now has ceased to exist mrs assinghamsaid and what in the world my dear did you mean by it thatsound as at the touch of a spring rang out as the first effectof fanny s speech it broke upon the two women s absorption witha sharpness almost equal to the smash of the crystal for thedoor of the room had been opened by the prince without theirtaking heed he had apparently had time moreover to catch theconclusion of fanny s act his eyes attached themselves throughthe large space allowing just there as happened a free view tothe shining fragments at this lady s feet his question had beenaddressed to his wife but he moved his eyes immediatelyafterwards to those of her visitor whose own then held them in amanner of which neither party had been capable doubtless formute penetration since the hour spent by him in cadogan place onthe eve of his marriage and the afternoon of charlotte sreappearance something now again became possible for thesecommunicants under the intensity of their pressure somethingthat took up that tale and that might have been a redemption ofpledges then exchanged this rapid play of suppressed appeal anddisguised response lasted indeed long enough for more resultsthan one long enough for mrs assingham to measure the feat ofquick self recovery possibly therefore of recognition still moreimmediate accompanying amerigo s vision and estimate of theevidence with which she had been so admirably she felt as shelooked at him inspired to deal she looked at him and looked athim there were so many things she wanted on the spot to say but maggie was looking too and was moreover looking at themboth so that these things for the elder woman quickly enoughreduced themselves to one she met his question not too late since in their silence it had remained in the air gatheringherself to go leaving the golden bowl split into three pieces onthe ground she simply referred him to his wife she should seethem later they would all meet soon again and meanwhile as towhat maggie had meant she said in her turn from the door why maggie herself was doubtless by this time ready to tell him xxxivleft with her husband maggie however for the time saidnothing she only felt on the spot a strong sharp wish not tosee his face again till he should have had a minute to arrangeit she had seen it enough for her temporary clearness and hernext movement seen it as it showed during the stare of surprisethat followed his entrance then it was that she knew how hugelyexpert she had been made for judging it quickly by that visionof it indelibly registered for reference that had flashed alight into her troubled soul the night of his late return frommatcham the expression worn by it at that juncture for howeverfew instants had given her a sense of its possibilities one ofthe most relevant of which might have been playing up for her before the consummation of fanny assingham s retreat just longenough to be recognised what she had recognised in it was hisrecognition the result of his having been forced by the flushof their visitor s attitude and the unextinguished report of herwords to take account of the flagrant signs of the accident ofthe incident on which he had unexpectedly dropped he had notunnaturally failed to see this occurrence represented by thethree fragments of an object apparently valuable which lay thereon the floor and which even across the width of the room hiskept interval reminded him unmistakably though confusedly ofsomething known some other unforgotten image that was a mereshock that was a pain as if fanny s violence had been aviolence redoubled and acting beyond its intention a violencecalling up the hot blood as a blow across the mouth might havecalled it maggie knew as she turned away from him that shedidn t want his pain what she wanted was her own simplecertainty not the red mark of conviction flaming there in hisbeauty if she could have gone on with bandaged eyes she wouldhave liked that best if it were a question of saying what shenow apparently should have to and of taking from him what hewould say any blindness that might wrap it would be the nearestapproach to a boon she went in silence to where her friend never in intention visibly so much her friend as at that moment had braced herselfto so amazing an energy and there under amerigo s eyes shepicked up the shining pieces bedizened and jewelled in herrustling finery she paid with humility of attitude this prompttribute to order only to find however that she could carry buttwo of the fragments at once she brought them over to thechimney piece to the conspicuous place occupied by the cupbefore fanny s appropriation of it and after laying themcarefully down went back for what remained the solid detachedfoot with this she returned to the mantel shelf placing it withdeliberation in the centre and then for a minute occupyingherself as with the attempt to fit the other morsels after shehad squared again her little objects on the chimney she waswithin an ace in fact of turning on him with that appeal besides its being lucid for her all the while that the occasionwas passing that they were dining out that he wasn t dressed and that though she herself was she was yet in allprobability so horribly red in the face and so awry in manyways with agitation that in view of the ambassador s company of possible comments and constructions she should need beforeher glass some restoration of appearances amerigo meanwhile after all could clearly make the most of herhaving enjoined on him to wait suggested it by the positive pompof her dealings with the smashed cup to wait that is till sheshould pronounce as mrs assingham had promised for her thisdelay again certainly tested her presence of mind though thatstrain was not what presently made her speak keep her eyes forthe time from her husband s as she might she soon found herselfmuch more drivingly conscious of the strain on his own wit therewas even a minute when her back was turned to him during whichshe knew once more the strangeness of her desire to spare him astrangeness that had already fifty times brushed her in thedepth of her trouble as with the wild wing of some bird of theair who might blindly have swooped for an instant into the shaftof a well darkening there by his momentary flutter the far offround of sky it was extraordinary this quality in the taste ofher wrong which made her completed sense of it seem rather tosoften than to harden and it was the more extraordinary the moreshe had to recognise it for what it came to was that seeingherself finally sure knowing everything having the fact in allits abomination so utterly before her that there was nothingelse to add what it came to was that merely by being with himthere in silence she felt within her the sudden split betweenconviction and action they had begun to cease on the spot surprisingly to be connected conviction that is budged noinch only planting its feet the more firmly in the soil butaction began to hover like some lighter and larger but easierform excited by its very power to keep above ground it would befree it would be independent it would go in wouldn t it forsome prodigious and superior adventure of its own what wouldcondemn it so to speak to the responsibility of freedom thisglimmered on maggie even now was the possibility richer withevery lapsing moment that her husband would have on the wholequestion a new need of her a need which was in fact being bornbetween them in these very seconds it struck her truly as so newthat he would have felt hitherto none to compare with it at all would indeed absolutely by this circumstance be really needingher for the first one in their whole connection no he had usedher had even exceedingly enjoyed her before this but there hadbeen no precedent for that character of a proved necessity to himwhich she was rapidly taking on the immense advantage of thisparticular clue moreover was that she should have now toarrange alter to falsify nothing should have to be butconsistently simple and straight she asked herself withconcentration while her back was still presented what would bethe very ideal of that method after which the next instant ithad all come to her and she had turned round upon him for theapplication fanny assingham broke it knowing it had a crackand that it would go if she used sufficient force she thought when i had told her that that would be the best thing to do withit thought so from her own point of view that hadn t been atall my idea but she acted before i understood i had on thecontrary she explained put it here in full view exactlythat you might see he stood with his hands in his pockets he had carried his eyesto the fragments on the chimney piece and she could alreadydistinguish the element of relief absolutely of succour in hisacceptance from her of the opportunity to consider the fruits oftheir friend s violence every added inch of reflection and delayhaving the advantage from this point on of counting for himdouble it had operated within her now to the last intensity herglimpse of the precious truth that by her helping him helpinghim to help himself as it were she should help him to help her hadn t she fairly got into his labyrinth with him wasn t sheindeed in the very act of placing herself there for him at itscentre and core whence on that definite orientation and by aninstinct all her own she might securely guide him out of it sheoffered him thus assuredly a kind of support that was not tohave been imagined in advance and that moreover required ahmost truly some close looking at before it could be believed inand pronounced void of treachery yes look look she seemedto see him hear her say even while her sounded words were other look look both at the truth that still survives in thatsmashed evidence and at the even more remarkable appearance thati m not such a fool as you supposed me look at the possibilitythat since i am different there may still be something in itfor you if you re capable of working with me to get that out consider of course as you must the question of what you mayhave to surrender on your side what price you may have to pay whom you may have to pay with to set this advantage free buttake in at any rate that there is something for you if youdon t too blindly spoil your chance for it he went no nearerthe damnatory pieces but he eyed them from where he stood witha degree of recognition just visibly less to be dissimulated allof which represented for her a certain traceable process and heruttered words meanwhile were different enough from those hemight have inserted between the lines of her already spoken it s the golden bowl you know that you saw at the littleantiquario s in bloomsbury so long ago when you went there withcharlotte when you spent those hours with her unknown to me aday or two before our marriage it was shown you both but youdidn t take it you left it for me and i came upon it extraordinarily through happening to go into the same shop onmonday last in walking home in prowling about to pick up somesmall old thing for father s birthday after my visit to themuseum my appointment there with mr crichton of which i toldyou it was shown me and i was struck with it and took it knowing nothing about it at the time what i now know i velearned since i learned this afternoon a couple of hours ago receiving from it naturally a great impression so there it is in its three pieces you can handle them don t be afraid if youwant to make sure the thing is the thing you and charlotte sawtogether its having come apart makes an unfortunate differencefor its beauty its artistic value but none for anything else its other value is just the same i mean that of its having givenme so much of the truth about you i don t therefore so much carewhat becomes of it now unless perhaps you may yourself when youcome to think have some good use for it in that case maggiewound up we can easily take the pieces with us to fawns it was wonderful how she felt by the time she had seen herselfthrough this narrow pass that she had really achievedsomething that she was emerging a little in fine with theprospect less contracted she had done for him that is what herinstinct enjoined had laid a basis not merely momentary on whichhe could meet her when by the turn of his head he did finallymeet her this was the last thing that glimmered out of his look but it came into sight none the less as a perception of hisdistress and almost as a question of his eyes so that for stillanother minute before he committed himself there occurredbetween them a kind of unprecedented moral exchange over whichher superior lucidity presided it was not however that when hedid commit himself the show was promptly portentous but what inthe world has fanny assingham had to do with it she could verily out of all her smothered soreness almost havesmiled his question so affected her as giving the whole thing upto her but it left her only to go the straighter she has hadto do with it that i immediately sent for her and that sheimmediately came she was the first person i wanted to see because i knew she would know know more about what i hadlearned i mean than i could make out for myself i made out asmuch as i could for myself that i also wanted to have done butit didn t in spite of everything take me very far and she hasreally been a help not so much as she would like to be not somuch as poor dear she just now tried to be yet she has doneher very best for you never forget that and has kept me alongimmeasurably better than i should have been able to come withouther she has gained me time and that these three months don tyou see has been everything she had said don t you see on purpose and was to feel thenext moment that it had acted these three months the princeasked counting from the night you came home so late from matcham counting from the hours you spent with charlotte at gloucester your visit to the cathedral which you won t have forgottendescribing to me in so much detail for that was the beginning ofmy being sure before it i had been sufficiently in doubt sure maggie developed of your having and of your having for a longtime had two relations with charlotte he stared a little at sea as he took it up two something in the tone of it gave it a sense or an ambiguity almost foolish leaving maggie to feel as in a flash how such aconsequence a foredoomed infelicity partaking of the ridiculouseven in one of the cleverest might be of the very essence of thepenalty of wrong doing oh you may have had fifty had the samerelation with her fifty times it s of the number of kinds ofrelation with her that i speak a number that doesn t matter really so long as there wasn t only one kind as father and isupposed one kind she went on was there before us we tookthat fully for granted as you saw and accepted it we neverthought of there being another kept out of our sight but afterthe evening i speak of i knew there was something else as i say i had before that my idea which you never dreamed i had fromthe moment i speak of it had more to go upon and you becameyourselves you and she vaguely yet uneasily conscious of thedifference but it s within these last hours that i ve most seenwhere we are and as i ve been in communication with fannyassingham about my doubts so i wanted to let her know mycertainty with the determination of which however you mustunderstand she has had nothing to do she defends you maggieremarked he had given her all his attention and with this impression forher again that he was in essence fairly reaching out to herfor time time only time she could sufficiently imagine and towhatever strangeness that he absolutely liked her to talk evenat the cost of his losing almost everything else by it it wasstill for a minute as if he waited for something worse wantedeverything that was in her to come out any definite fact anything more precisely nameable so that he too as was hisright should know where he was what stirred in him above all while he followed in her face the clear train of her speech musthave been the impulse to take up something she put before himthat he was yet afraid directly to touch he wanted to make freewith it but had to keep his hands off for reasons he hadalready made out and the discomfort of his privation yearned ather out of his eyes with an announcing gleam of the fever thenone too tolerable chill of specific recognition she affectedhim as speaking more or less for her father as well and his eyesmight have been trying to hypnotise her into giving him theanswer without his asking the question had he his idea and hashe now with you anything more those were the words he had tohold himself from not speaking and that she would as yet certainly do nothing to make easy she felt with her sharpestthrill how he was straitened and tied and with the miserablepity of it her present conscious purpose of keeping him so couldnone the less perfectly accord to name her father on any suchbasis of anxiety of compunction would be to do the impossiblething to do neither more nor less than give charlotte away visibly palpably traceably he stood off from this movedback from it as from an open chasm now suddenly perceived butwhich had been between the two with so much so strangely muchelse quite uncalculated verily it towered before her thishistory of their confidence they had built strong and piledhigh based as it was on such appearances their conviction that thanks to her native complacencies of so many sorts she wouldalways quite to the end and through and through take them asnobly sparing her amerigo was at any rate having the sensationof a particular ugliness to avoid a particular difficulty tocount with that practically found him as unprepared as if he hadbeen like his wife an abjectly simple person and shemeanwhile however abjectly simple was further discerning forherself that whatever he might have to take from her shebeing on her side beautifully free he would absolutely not beable for any qualifying purpose to name charlotte either ashis father in law s wife mrs verver rose between them there forthe time in august and prohibitive form to protect her defendher explain about her was at the least to bring her into thequestion which would be by the same stroke to bring her husband but this was exactly the door maggie wouldn t open to him on allof which she was the next moment asking herself if thus warnedand embarrassed he were not fairly writhing in his pain hewrithed on that hypothesis some seconds more for it was nottill then that he had chosen between what he could do and what hecouldn t you re apparently drawing immense conclusions from very smallmatters won t you perhaps feel in fairness that you restriking out triumphing or whatever i may call it rather tooeasily feel it when i perfectly admit that your smashed cupthere does come back to me i frankly confess now to theoccasion and to having wished not to speak of it to you at thetime we took two or three hours together by arrangement it wason the eve of my marriage at the moment you say but that put iton the eve of yours too my dear which was directly the point it was desired to find for you at the eleventh hour some smallwedding present a hunt for something worth giving you and yetpossible from other points of view as well in which it seemed icould be of use you were naturally not to be told preciselybecause it was all for you we went forth together and we looked we rummaged about and as i remember we called it we prowled then it was that as i freely recognise we came across thatcrystal cup which i m bound to say upon my honour i think itrather a pity fanny assingham from whatever good motive shouldhave treated so he had kept his hands in his pockets he turnedhis eyes again but more complacently now to the ruins of theprecious vessel and maggie could feel him exhale into theachieved quietness of his explanation a long deep breath ofcomparative relief behind everything beneath everything it wassomehow a comfort to him at last to be talking with her and heseemed to be proving to himself that he could talk it was at alittle shop in bloomsbury i think i could go to the place now the man understood italian i remember he wanted awfully to workoff his bowl but i didn t believe in it and we didn t take it maggie had listened with an interest that wore all the expressionof candour oh you left it for me but what did you take he looked at her first as if he were trying to remember then asif he might have been trying to forget nothing i think atthat place what did you take then at any other what did you get me sincethat was your aim and end for a wedding gift the prince continued very nobly to bethink himself didn t weget you anything maggie waited a little she had for some time now kept her eyeson him steadily but they wandered at this to the fragments onher chimney yes it comes round after all to your having gotme the bowl i myself was to come upon it the other day by sowonderful a chance was to find it in the same place and to haveit pressed upon me by the same little man who does as you say understand italian i did believe in it you see must havebelieved in it somehow instinctively for i took it as soon as isaw it though i didn t know at all then she added what i wastaking with it the prince paid her for an instant visibly the deference oftrying to imagine what this might have been i agree with youthat the coincidence is extraordinary the sort of thing thathappens mainly in novels and plays but i don t see you must letme say the importance or the connexion of my having made the purchase where you failed of it she hadquickly taken him up but she had with her eyes on him oncemore another drop into the order of her thoughts to which through whatever he might say she was still adhering it s notmy having gone into the place at the end of four years thatmakes the strangeness of the coincidence for don t such chancesas that in london easily occur the strangeness she lucidlysaid is in what my purchase was to represent to me after i hadgot it home which value came she explained from the wonderof my having found such a friend such a friend as a wonder assuredly her husband could buttake it as the little man in the shop he did for me more than he knew i owe it to him he took an interest in me maggie said and taking that interest he recalled your visit he remembered youand spoke of you to me on which the prince passed the comment of a sceptical smile ahbut my dear if extraordinary things come from people s takingan interest in you my life in that case she asked must be very agitated well he liked me i mean very particularly it s only so i canaccount for my afterwards hearing from him and in fact he gaveme that to day she pursued he gave me it frankly as hisreason to day the prince inquiringly echoed but she was singularly able it had been marvellously given her she afterwards said to herself to abide for her light forher clue by her own order i inspired him with sympathy there you are but the miracle isthat he should have a sympathy to offer that could be of use tome that was really the oddity of my chance the princessproceeded that i should have been moved in my ignorance to goprecisely to him he saw her so keep her course that it was as if he could at thebest but stand aside to watch her and let her pass he only madea vague demonstration that was like an ineffective gesture i msorry to say any ill of your friends and the thing was a longtime ago besides which there was nothing to make me recur to it but i remember the man s striking me as a decided little beast she gave a slow headshake as if no after consideration notthat way were an issue i can only think of him as kind for hehad nothing to gain he had in fact only to lose it was what hecame to tell me that he had asked me too high a price more thanthe object was really worth there was a particular reason whichhe hadn t mentioned and which had made him consider and repent he wrote for leave to see me again wrote in such terms that isaw him here this afternoon here it made the prince look about him downstairs in the little red room while he was waiting helooked at the few photographs that stand about there andrecognised two of them though it was so long ago he rememberedthe visit made him by the lady and the gentleman and that gavehim his connexion it gave me mine for he remembered everythingand told me everything you see you too had produced your effect only unlike you he had thought of it again he had recurred toit he told me of your having wished to make each otherpresents but of that s not having come off the lady was greatlytaken with the piece i had bought of him but you had your reasonagainst receiving it from her and you had been right he wouldthink that of you more than ever now maggie went on he wouldsee how wisely you had guessed the flaw and how easily the bowlcould be broken i had bought it myself you see for apresent he knew i was doing that this was what had worked inhim especially after the price i had paid her story had dropped an instant she still brought it out insmall waves of energy each of which spent its force so that hehad an opportunity to speak before this force was renewed butthe quaint thing was what he now said and what pray was theprice she paused again a little it was high certainly for thosefragments i think i feel as i look at them there ratherashamed to say the prince then again looked at them he might have been growingused to the sight but shall you at least get your money back oh i m far from wanting it back i feel so that i m getting itsworth with which before he could reply she had a quicktransition the great fact about the day we re talking of seemsto me to have been quite remarkably that no present was thenmade me if your undertaking had been for that that was not atleast what came of it you received then nothing at all the prince looked vague andgrave almost retrospectively concerned nothing but an apology for empty hands and empty pockets whichwas made me as if it mattered a mite ever so frankly ever sobeautifully and touchingly this amerigo heard with interest yet not with confusion ah ofcourse you couldn t have minded distinctly as she went on hewas getting the better of the mere awkwardness of his arrest quite as if making out that he need suffer arrest from her now before they should go forth to show themselves in the worldtogether in no greater quantity than an occasion ill chosen atthe best for a scene might decently make room for he looked athis watch their engagement all the while remained before him but i don t make out you see what case against me yourest on everything i m telling you why the whole case the case ofyour having for so long so successfully deceived me the idea ofyour finding something for me charming as that would have been was what had least to do with your taking a morning together atthat moment what had really to do with it said maggie wasthat you had to you couldn t not from the moment you were againface to face and the reason of that was that there had been somuch between you before before i came between you at all her husband had been for these last moments moving about underher eyes but at this as to check any show of impatience heagain stood still you ve never been more sacred to me than youwere at that hour unless perhaps you ve become so at this one the assurance of his speech she could note quite held up itshead in him his eyes met her own so for the declaration thatit was as if something cold and momentarily unimaginable breathedupon her from afar off out of his strange consistency she kepther direction still however under that oh the thing i veknown best of all is that you ve never wanted together tooffend us you ve wanted quite intensely not to and theprecautions you ve had to take for it have been for a long timeone of the strongest of my impressions that i think sheadded is the way i ve best known known he repeated after a moment known known that you were older friends and so much moreintimate ones than i had any reason to suppose when we married known there were things that hadn t been told me and that gavetheir meaning little by little to other things that were beforeme would they have made a difference in the matter of ourmarriage the prince presently asked if you had known them she took her time to think i grant you not in the matter ofours and then as he again fixed her with his hard yearning which he couldn t keep down the question is so much bigger thanthat you see how much what i know makes of it for me that waswhat acted on him this iteration of her knowledge into thequestion of the validity of the various bearings of which hecouldn t on the spot trust himself to pretend in any high way to go what her claim as she made it represented for him thathe couldn t help betraying if only as a consequence of theeffect of the word itself her repeated distinct know know onhis nerves she was capable of being sorry for his nerves at atime when he should need them for dining out pompously ratherresponsibly without his heart in it yet she was not to let thatprevent her using with all economy so precious a chance forsupreme clearness i didn t force this upon you you mustrecollect and it probably wouldn t have happened for you if youhadn t come in ah said the prince i was liable to come in you know i didn t think you were this evening and why not well she answered you have many liabilities of differentsorts with which she recalled what she had said to fannyassingham and then you re so deep it produced in his features in spite of his control of them oneof those quick plays of expression the shade of a grimace thattestified as nothing else did to his race it s you cara whoare deep which after an instant she had accepted from him she could sofeel at last that it was true then i shall have need of itall but what would you have done he was by this time asking if ihadn t come in i don t know she had hesitated what would you oh io that isn t the question i depend upon you i go on youwould have spoken to morrow i think i would have waited and for what he asked to see what difference it would make for myself my possessionat last i mean of real knowledge oh said the prince my only point now at any rate she went on is thedifference as i say that it may make for you your knowingwas from the moment you did come in all i had in view and shesounded it again he should have it once more your knowing thati ve ceased that you ve ceased with her pause in fact she had fairlymade him press her for it why to be as i was not to know it was once more then after a little that he had had to standreceptive yet the singular effect of this was that there wasstill something of the same sort he was made to want he hadanother hesitation but at last this odd quantity showed thendoes any one else know it was as near as he could come to naming her father and shekept him at that distance any one any one i mean but fanny assingham i should have supposed you had had by this time particular meansof learning i don t see she said why you ask me then after an instant and only after an instant as she saw hemade out what she meant and it gave her all strangely enough the still further light that charlotte for herself knew aslittle as he had known the vision loomed in this light itfairly glared for the few seconds the vision of the two othersalone together at fawns and charlotte as one of them havinggropingly to go on always not knowing and not knowing thepicture flushed at the same time with all its essential colour that of the so possible identity of her father s motive andprinciple with her own he was deep as amerigo called it sothat no vibration of the still air should reach his daughter just as she had earned that description by making and by forthat matter intending still to make her care for his serenity or at any rate for the firm outer shell of his dignity allmarvellous enamel her paramount law more strangely even thananything else her husband seemed to speak now but to help her inthis i know nothing but what you tell me then i ve told you all i intended find out the rest find it out he waited she stood before him a moment it took that time to go on depthupon depth of her situation as she met his face surged and sankwithin her but with the effect somehow once more that theyrather lifted her than let her drop she had her feet somewhere through it all it was her companion absolutely who was at sea and she kept her feet she pressed them to what was beneath her she went over to the bell beside the chimney and gave a ring thathe could but take as a summons for her maid it stoppedeverything for the present it was an intimation to him to go anddress but she had to insist find out for yourself part fifthxxxvafter the little party was again constituted at fawns which hadtaken for completeness some ten days maggie naturally feltherself still more possessed in spirit of everything that hadlast happened in london there was a phrase that came back to herfrom old american years she was having by that idiom the timeof her life she knew it by the perpetual throb of this sense ofpossession which was almost too violent either to recognise orto hide it was as if she had come out that was her most generalconsciousness out of a dark tunnel a dense wood or even simplya smoky room and had thereby at least for going on theadvantage of air in her lungs it was as if she were somehow atlast gathering in the fruits of patience she had either beenreally more patient than she had known at the time or had beenso for longer the change brought about by itself as great adifference of view as the shift of an inch in the position of atelescope it was her telescope in fact that had gained inrange just as her danger lay in her exposing herself to theobservation by the more charmed and therefore the more reckless use of this optical resource not under any provocation toproduce it in public was her unremitted rule but thedifficulties of duplicity had not shrunk while the need of ithad doubled humbugging which she had so practised with herfather had been a comparatively simple matter on the basis ofmere doubt but the ground to be covered was now greatly larger and she felt not unlike some young woman of the theatre who engaged for a minor part in the play and having mastered her cueswith anxious effort should find herself suddenly promoted toleading lady and expected to appear in every act of the five shehad made much to her husband that last night of her knowing but it was exactly this quantity she now knew that from themoment she could only dissimulate it added to her responsibilityand made of the latter all a mere question of havingsomething precious and precarious in charge there was no one tohelp her with it not even fanny assingham now this goodfriend s presence having become inevitably with that climax oftheir last interview in portland place a severely simplifiedfunction she had her use oh yes a thousand times but it couldonly consist henceforth in her quite conspicuously touching at nopoint whatever assuredly at least with maggie the matter theyhad discussed she was there inordinately as a value but as avalue only for the clear negation of everything she was theirgeneral sign precisely of unimpaired beatitude and she was tolive up to that somewhat arduous character poor thing as shemight she might privately lapse from it if she must withamerigo or with charlotte only not of course ever so much asfor the wink of an eye with the master of the house such lapseswould be her own affair which maggie at present could take nothought of she treated her young friend meanwhile it was to besaid to no betrayal of such wavering so that from the moment ofher alighting at the door with the colonel everything went onbetween them at concert pitch what had she done that lastevening in maggie s room but bring the husband and wife moretogether than as would seem they had ever been therefore whatindiscretion should she not show by attempting to go behind thegrand appearance of her success which would be to court a doubtof her beneficent work she knew accordingly nothing but harmonyand diffused restlessly nothing but peace an extravagant expressive aggressive peace not incongruous after all withthe solid calm of the place a kind of helmetted trident shakingpax britannica the peace it must be added had become as the days elapsed apeace quite generally animated and peopled thanks to that factof the presence of company in which maggie s ability topreserve an appearance had learned from so far back to find itsbest resource it was not inconspicuous it was in fact striking that this resource just now seemed to meet in the highestdegree every one s need quite as if every one were by themultiplication of human objects in the scene by the creation bythe confusion of fictive issues hopeful of escaping somebodyelse s notice it had reached the point in truth that thecollective bosom might have been taken to heave with theknowledge of the descent upon adjacent shores for a shortperiod of mrs rance and the lutches still united and still sodivided for conquest the sense of the party showed at least oddly enough as favourable to the fancy of the quaint turn thatsome near week end might derive from their reappearance thismeasured for maggie the ground they had all travelled togethersince that unforgotten afternoon of the none so distant year that determinant september sunday when sitting with her fatherin the park as in commemoration of the climax both of their oldorder and of their old danger she had proposed to him that theyshould call in charlotte call her in as a specialist might besummoned to an invalid s chair wasn t it a sign of somethingrather portentous their being ready to be beholden as for adiversion to the once despised kitty and dotty that had alreadyhad its application in truth to her invocation of thecastledeans and several other members again of the historicmatcham week made before she left town and made alwaysconsistently with an idea since she was never henceforth toapproach these people without an idea and since that luridelement of their intercourse grew and grew for her with eachoccasion the flame with which it burned afresh during theseparticular days the way it held up the torch to anything toeverything that might have occurred as the climax of revelsspringing from traditions so vivified this by itself justifiedher private motive and reconsecrated her diplomacy she hadalready produced by the aid of these people something of theeffect she sought that of being good for whatever hercompanions were good for and of not asking either of them togive up anyone or anything for her sake there was moreover frankly a sharpness of point in it that she enjoyed it gave anaccent to the truth she wished to illustrate the truth that thesurface of her recent life thick sown with the flower of earnestendeavour with every form of the unruffled and the undoubting suffered no symptom anywhere to peep out it was as if under herpressure neither party could get rid of the complicity as itmight be figured of the other as if in a word she saw amerigoand charlotte committed for fear of betrayals on their own side to a kind of wan consistency on the subject of lady castledean s set and this latter group by the same stroke compelled toassist at attestations the extent and bearing of which theyrather failed to grasp and which left them indeed in spite ofhereditary high spirits a trifle bewildered and even a triflescared they made none the less at fawns for number for movement forsound they played their parts during a

inthe form of a daylight bore one of the perceived outsiders whoare liable to be met in the drawing room or to be sat next to atdinner if the princess moreover had failed of her occult usefor so much of the machinery of diversion she would still havehad a sense not other than sympathetic for the advantage nowextracted from it by fanny assingham s bruised philosophy thisgood friend s relation to it was actually the revanche shesufficiently indicated of her obscured lustre at matcham whereshe had known her way about so much less than most of the others she knew it at fawns through the pathless wild of the righttone positively better than any one maggie could note for her and her revenge had the magnanimity of a brave pointing out of itto every one else a wonderful irresistible conscious almostcompassionate patronage here was a house she triumphantlycaused it to be noted in which she so bristled with values thatsome of them might serve by her amused willingness to share forsuch of the temporarily vague among her fellow guests such ofthe dimly disconcerted as had lost the key to their own it mayhave been partly through the effect of this especial strain ofcommunity with her old friend that maggie found herself oneevening moved to take up again their dropped directness ofreference they had remained downstairs together late the otherwomen of the party had filed singly or in couples up the grand staircase on which from the equally grand hall theseretreats and advances could always be pleasantly observed themen had apparently taken their way to the smoking room while theprincess in possession thus of a rare reach of view hadlingered as if to enjoy it then she saw that mrs assingham wasremaining a little and as for the appreciation of her enjoyment upon which they stood looking at each other across the clearedprospect until the elder woman only vaguely expressive andtentative now came nearer it was like the act of asking ifthere were anything she could yet do and that question wasanswered by her immediately feeling on this closer view as shehad felt when presenting herself in portland place after maggie slast sharp summons their understanding was taken up by these newsnatched moments where that occasion had left it he has never told her that i know of that i m at lastsatisfied and then as mrs assingham opened wide eyes i vebeen in the dark since we came down not understanding what hehas been doing or intending not making out what can have passedbetween them but within a day or two i ve begun to suspect andthis evening for reasons oh too many to tell you i ve beensure since it explains nothing has passed between them that swhat has happened it explains the princess repeated withenergy it explains it explains she spoke in a manner thather auditor was afterwards to describe to the colonel oddlyenough as that of the quietest excitement she had turned backto the chimney place where in honour of a damp day and a chillnight the piled logs had turned to flame and sunk to embers andthe evident intensity of her vision for the fact she impartedmade fanny assingham wait upon her words it explained thisstriking fact more indeed than her companion though consciousof fairly gaping with good will could swallow at once theprincess however as for indulgence and confidence quicklyfilled up the measure he hasn t let her know that i know and clearly doesn t mean to he has made up his mind he ll saynothing about it therefore as she s quite unable to arrive atthe knowledge by herself she has no idea how much i m really inpossession she believes said maggie and so far as her ownconviction goes she knows that i m not in possession ofanything and that somehow for my own help seems to meimmense immense my dear mrs assingham applausively murmured thoughnot quite even as yet seeing all the way he s keeping quietthen on purpose on purpose maggie s lighted eyes at least looked furtherthan they had ever looked he ll never tell her now fanny wondered she cast about her most of all she admired herlittle friend in whom this announcement was evidently animatedby an heroic lucidity she stood there in her full uniform likesome small erect commander of a siege an anxious captain who hassuddenly got news replete with importance for him of agitation of division within the place this importance breathed upon hercomrade so you re all right oh all right s a good deal to say but i seem at least to see as i haven t before where i am with it fanny bountifully brooded there was a point left vague and youhave it from him your husband himself has told you told me why what you speak of it isn t of an assurance received fromhim then that you do speak at which maggie had continued to stare dear me no do yousuppose i ve asked him for an assurance ah you haven t her companion smiled that s what i supposedyou might mean then darling what have you asked him for i ve asked him for nothing but this in turn made fanny stare then nothing that eveningof the embassy dinner passed between you on the contrary everything passed everything everything i told him what i knew and i told him how i knewit mrs assingham waited and that was all wasn t it quite enough oh love she bridled that s for you to have judged then i have judged said maggie i did judge i made sure heunderstood then i let him alone mrs assingham wondered but he didn t explain explain thank god no maggie threw back her head as with horror at the thought then the next moment added and i didn t either the decency of pride in it shed a cold little light yet as fromheights at the base of which her companion rather panted but ifhe neither denies nor confesses he does what s a thousand times better he lets it alone hedoes maggie went on as he would do as i see now that i wassure he would he lets me alone fanny assingham turned it over then how do you know so where as you say you are why just by that i put him in possession of the difference the difference made about me by the fact that i hadn t been after all though with a wonderful chance i admitted helpingme too stupid to have arrived at knowledge he had to see thati m changed for him quite changed from the idea of me that hehad so long been going on with it became a question then of hisreally taking in the change and what i now see is that he isdoing so fanny followed as she could which he shows by letting you asyou say alone maggie looked at her a minute and by letting her mrs assingham did what she might to embrace it checked alittle however by a thought that was the nearest approach shecould have in this almost too large air to an inspiration ah but does charlotte let him oh that s another affair with which i ve practically nothingto do i dare say however she doesn t and the princess had amore distant gaze for the image evoked by the question i don tin fact well see how she can but the point for me is that heunderstands yes fanny assingham cooed understands well what i want i want a happiness without a hole in it bigenough for you to poke in your finger a brilliant perfect surface to begin with at least i see the golden bowl as it was to have been and maggie dweltmusingly on this obscured figure the bowl with all ourhappiness in it the bowl without the crack for mrs assingham too the image had its force and the preciousobject shone before her again reconstituted plausible presentable but wasn t there still a piece missing yet if helets you alone and you only let him mayn t our doing so you mean be noticed mayn t it give usaway well we hope not we try not we take such care we aloneknow what s between us we and you and haven t you preciselybeen struck since you ve been here maggie asked with ourmaking so good a show her friend hesitated to your father but it made her hesitate too she wouldn t speak of her fatherdirectly to everyone to her now that you understand it held poor fanny again in wonder to charlotte yes ifthere s so much beneath it for you and if it s all such a plan that makes it hang together it makes you hang together shefairly exhaled her admiration you re like nobody else you reextraordinary maggie met it with appreciation but with a reserve no i m notextraordinary but i am for every one quiet well that s just what is extraordinary quiet is more than i am and you leave me far behind with which again for aninstant mrs assingham frankly brooded now that iunderstand you say but there s one thing i don t understand and the next minute while her companion waited she hadmentioned it how can charlotte after all not have pressedhim not have attacked him about it how can she not have askedhim asked him on his honour i mean if you know how can she not why of course said the princess limpidly she must well then well then you think he must have told her why exactly what imean said maggie is that he will have done nothing of thesort will as i say have maintained the contrary fanny assingham weighed it under her direct appeal for thetruth under her direct appeal for the truth her appeal to his honour her appeal to his honour that s my point fanny assingham braved it for the truth as from him to her from him to any one mrs assingham s face lighted he ll simply he ll insistentlyhave lied maggie brought it out roundly he ll simply he ll insistentlyhave lied it held again her companion who next however with a singlemovement throwing herself on her neck overflowed oh if youknew how you help me maggie had liked her to understand so far as this was possible but had not been slow to see afterwards how the possibility waslimited when one came to think by mysteries she was not tosound this inability in her was indeed not remarkable inasmuchas the princess herself as we have seen was only now in aposition to boast of touching bottom maggie lived inwardly ina consciousness that she could but partly open even to so good afriend and her own visitation of the fuller expanse of whichwas for that matter still going on they had been duskierstill however these recesses of her imagination that nodoubt was what might at present be said for them she had lookedinto them on the eve of her leaving town almost withoutpenetration she had made out in those hours and also of atruth during the days which immediately followed little morethan the strangeness of a relation having for its chief mark whether to be prolonged or not the absence of any intimate result of the crisis she had invited her husband to recognise they had dealt with this crisis again face to face verybriefly the morning after the scene in her room but with theodd consequence of her having appeared merely to leave it on hishands he had received it from her as he might have received abunch of keys or a list of commissions attentive to herinstructions about them but only putting them for the time very carefully and safely into his pocket the instructions hadseemed from day to day to make so little difference for hisbehaviour that is for his speech or his silence to produce asyet so little of the fruit of action he had taken from her onthe spot in a word before going to dress for dinner all shethen had to give after which on the morrow he had asked herfor more a good deal as if she might have renewed her supplyduring the night but he had had at his command for this latterpurpose an air of extraordinary detachment and discretion an airamounting really to an appeal which if she could have broughtherself to describe it vulgarly she would have described ascool just as he himself would have described it in any one elseas cheeky a suggestion that she should trust him on theparticular ground since she didn t on the general neither hisspeech nor his silence struck her as signifying more or less under this pressure than they had seemed to signify for weekspast yet if her sense hadn t been absolutely closed to thepossibility in him of any thought of wounding her she might havetaken his undisturbed manner the perfection of his appearance ofhaving recovered himself for one of those intentions of highimpertinence by the aid of which great people les grandsseigneurs persons of her husband s class and type always knowhow to re establish a violated order it was her one purely good fortune that she could feel thus sureimpertinence to her at any rate was not among the arts on whichhe proposed to throw himself for though he had in so almostmystifying a manner replied to nothing denied nothing explained nothing apologised for nothing he had somehowconveyed to her that this was not because of any determination totreat her case as not worth it there had been consideration on both occasions in the way he had listened to her even thoughat the same time there had been extreme reserve a reserveindeed it was also to be remembered qualified by the fact that on their second and shorter interview in portland place andquite at the end of this passage she had imagined him positivelyproposing to her a temporary accommodation it had been but thematter of something in the depths of the eyes he finally fixedupon her and she had found in it the more she kept it beforeher the tacitly offered sketch of a working arrangement leaveme my reserve don t question it it s all i have just now don t you see so that if you ll make me the concession ofletting me alone with it for as long a time as i require ipromise you something or other grown under cover of it eventhough i don t yet quite make out what as a return for yourpatience she had turned away from him with some such unspokenwords as that in her ear and indeed she had to represent toherself that she had spiritually heard them had to listen tothem still again to explain her particular patience in face ofhis particular failure he hadn t so much as pretended to meetfor an instant the question raised by her of her acceptedignorance of the point in time the period before their ownmarriage from which his intimacy with charlotte dated as anignorance in which he and charlotte had been personallyinterested and to the pitch of consummately protecting foryears each other s interest as a condition so imposed upon herthe fact of its having ceased might have made it on the spot the first article of his defence he had vouchsafed it however nothing better than his longest stare of postponed consideration that tribute he had coldly paid it and maggie might herself havebeen stupefied truly had she not had something to hold on by at her own present ability even provisional to make terms witha chapter of history into which she could but a week before nothave dipped without a mortal chill at the rate at which she wasliving she was getting used hour by hour to these extensions ofview and when she asked herself at fawns to what singleobservation of her own in london the prince had had anaffirmation to oppose she but just failed to focus the smallstrained wife of the moments in question as some panting dancerof a difficult step who had capered before the footlights of anempty theatre to a spectator lounging in a box her best comprehension of amerigo s success in not committinghimself was in her recall meanwhile of the inquiries he hadmade of her on their only return to the subject and which he hadin fact explicitly provoked their return in order to make he hadhad it over with her again the so distinctly remarkable incidentof her interview at home with the little bloomsbury shopman thisanecdote for him had not altogether surprisingly requiredsome straighter telling and the prince s attitude in presence ofit had represented once more his nearest approach to across examination the difficulty in respect to the little manhad been for the question of his motive his motive in writing first in the spirit of retraction to a lady with whom he hadmade a most advantageous bargain and in then coming to see herso that his apology should be personal maggie had felt herexplanation weak but there were the facts and she could give noother left alone after the transaction with the knowledge thathis visitor designed the object bought of him as a birthday giftto her father for maggie confessed freely to having chattered tohim almost as to a friend the vendor of the golden bowl hadacted on a scruple rare enough in vendors of any class andalmost unprecedented in the thrifty children of israel he hadn tliked what he had done and what he had above all made such a good thing of having done at the thought of his purchaser sgood faith and charming presence opposed to that flaw in heracquestion which would make it verily as an offering to a lovedparent a thing of sinister meaning and evil effect he had knownconscientious he had known superstitious visitings had givenway to a whim all the more remarkable to his own commercial mind no doubt from its never having troubled him in other connexions she had recognised the oddity of her adventure and left it toshow for what it was she had not been unconscious on the otherhand that if it hadn t touched amerigo so nearly he would havefound in it matter for some amused reflection he had uttered anextraordinary sound something between a laugh and a howl on hersaying as she had made a point of doing oh most certainly hetold me his reason was because he liked me though sheremained in doubt of whether that inarticulate comment had beenprovoked most by the familiarities she had offered or by thosethat so pictured she had had to endure that the partner of herbargain had yearned to see her again that he had plainly jumpedat a pretext for it this also she had frankly expressed herselfto the prince as having in no snubbing no scandalised butrather in a positively appreciative and indebted spirit notdelayed to make out he had wished ever so seriously to returnher a part of her money and she had wholly declined to receiveit and then he had uttered his hope that she had not at allevents already devoted the crystal cup to the beautiful purposeshe had so kindly and so fortunately named to him it wasn t athing for a present to a person she was fond of for she wouldn twish to give a present that would bring ill luck that had cometo him so that he couldn t rest and he should feel better nowthat he had told her his having led her to act in ignorance waswhat he should have been ashamed of and if she would pardon gracious lady as she was all the liberties he had taken shemight make of the bowl any use in life but that one it was after this that the most extraordinary incident of all ofcourse had occurred his pointing to the two photographs withthe remark that those were persons he knew and that morewonderful still he had made acquaintance with them yearsbefore precisely over the same article the lady on thatoccasion had taken up the fancy of presenting it to thegentleman and the gentleman guessing and dodging ever socleverly had declared that he wouldn t for the world receive anobject under such suspicion he himself the little man hadconfessed wouldn t have minded about them but he had neverforgotten either their talk or their faces the impressionaltogether made by them and if she really wished to know now what had perhaps most moved him it was the thought that sheshould ignorantly have gone in for a thing not good enough forother buyers he had been immensely struck that was anotherpoint with this accident of their turning out after so long friends of hers too they had disappeared and this was the onlylight he had ever had upon them he had flushed up quite red with his recognition with all his responsibility had declaredthat the connexion must have had mysteriously something to dowith the impulse he had obeyed and maggie had made to herhusband while he again stood before her no secret of the shock for herself so suddenly and violently received she had done herbest even while taking it full in the face not to give herselfaway but she wouldn t answer no she wouldn t for what shemight in her agitation have made her informant think he mightthink what he would there had been three or four minutes duringwhich while she asked him question upon question she haddoubtless too little cared and he had spoken for hisremembrance as fully as she could have wished he had spoken oh delightedly for the terms on which his other visitors hadappeared to be with each other and in fact for that convictionof the nature and degree of their intimacy under which in spiteof precautions they hadn t been able to help leaving him he hadobserved and judged and not forgotten he had been sure they weregreat people but no ah no distinctly hadn t liked them ashe liked the signora principessa certainly she had created novagueness about that he had been in possession of her name andaddress for sending her both her cup and her account but theothers he had only always wondered about he had been sure theywould never come back and as to the time of their visit hecould place it positively to a day by reason of a transactionof importance recorded in his books that had occurred but a fewhours later he had left her in short definitely rejoicing thathe had been able to make up to her for not having been quite square over their little business by rendering her sounexpectedly the service of this information his joy moreover was as much as amerigo would a matter of the personal interestwith which her kindness gentleness grace her charmingpresence and easy humanity and familiarity had inspired him allof which while in thought maggie went over it again and again oh over any imputable rashness of her own immediate passionand pain as well as over the rest of the straight little storyshe had after all to tell might very conceivably make a longsum for the prince to puzzle out there were meanwhile after the castledeans and those invited tomeet them had gone and before mrs rance and the lutches hadcome three or four days during which she was to learn the fullextent of her need not to be penetrable and then it was indeedthat she felt all the force and threw herself upon all the help of the truth she had confided several nights earlier to fannyassingham she had known it in advance had warned herself of itwhile the house was full charlotte had designs upon her of anature best known to herself and was only waiting for the betteropportunity of their finding themselves less companioned thisconsciousness had been exactly at the bottom of maggie s wish tomultiply their spectators there were moments for her positively moments of planned postponement of evasion scarcelyless disguised than studied during which she turned over withanxiety the different ways there being two or three possibleones in which her young stepmother might at need seek to workupon her amerigo s not having told her of his passage with hiswife gave for maggie altogether a new aspect to charlotte sconsciousness and condition an aspect with which forapprehension for wonder and even at moments inconsequentlyenough for something like compassion the princess had now toreckon she asked herself for she was capable of that what hehad meant by keeping the sharer of his guilt in the dark about amatter touching her otherwise so nearly what he had meant thatis for this unmistakably mystified personage herself maggiecould imagine what he had meant for her all sorts of thinkablethings whether things of mere form or things of sincerity things of pity or things of prudence he had meant for instance in all probability primarily to conjure away any suchappearance of a changed relation between the two women as hisfather in law might notice and follow up it would have been opento him however given the pitch of their intimacy to avert thisdanger by some more conceivable course with charlotte since anearnest warning in fact the full freedom of alarm that of hisinsisting to her on the peril of suspicion incurred and on theimportance accordingly of outward peace at any price would havebeen the course really most conceivable instead of warning andadvising he had reassured and deceived her so that our youngwoman who had been from far back by the habit if her nature as much on her guard against sacrificing others as if she feltthe great trap of life mainly to be set for one s doing so nowfound herself attaching her fancy to that side of the situationof the exposed pair which involved for themselves at least thesacrifice of the least fortunate she never at present thought of what amerigo might beintending without the reflection by the same stroke that whatever this quantity he was leaving still more to her owningenuity he was helping her when the thing came to the test only by the polished possibly almost too polished surface hismanner to his wife wore for an admiring world and that surely was entitled to scarcely more than the praise of negativediplomacy he was keeping his manner right as she had related tomrs assingham the case would have been beyond calculation truly if on top of everything he had allowed it to go wrong she had hours of exaltation indeed when the meaning of all thispressed in upon her as a tacit vow from him to abide withoutquestion by whatever she should be able to achieve or think fitto prescribe then it was that even while holding her breath forthe awe of it she truly felt almost able enough for anything itwas as if she had passed in a time incredibly short from beingnothing for him to being all it was as if rightly noted everyturn of his head every tone of his voice in these days mightmean that there was but one way in which a proud man reduced toabjection could hold himself during those of maggie s vigils inwhich that view loomed largest the image of her husband that itthus presented to her gave out a beauty for the revelation ofwhich she struck herself as paying if anything all too little to make sure of it to make sure of the beauty shining out of thehumility and of the humility lurking in all the pride of hispresence she would have gone the length of paying more yet ofpaying with difficulties and anxieties compared to which thoseactually before her might have been as superficial as headachesor rainy days the point at which these exaltations dropped however was thepoint at which it was apt to come over her that if hercomplications had been greater the question of paying would havebeen limited still less to the liabilities of her own pocket thecomplications were verily great enough whether for ingenuitiesor sublimities so long as she had to come back to it so oftenthat charlotte all the while could only be struggling withsecrets sharper than her own it was odd how that certainty againand again determined and coloured her wonderments of detail thequestion for instance of how amerigo in snatched opportunitiesof conference put the haunted creature off with falseexplanations met her particular challenges and evaded if thatwas what he did do her particular demands even the convictionthat charlotte was but awaiting some chance really to test hertrouble upon her lover s wife left maggie s sense meanwhile openas to the sight of gilt wires and bruised wings the spacious butsuspended cage the home of eternal unrest of pacings beatings shakings all so vain into which the baffled consciousnesshelplessly resolved itself the cage was the deluded condition and maggie as having known delusion rather understood thenature of cages she walked round charlotte s cautiously and ina very wide circle and when inevitably they had to communicateshe felt herself comparatively outside on the breast ofnature and saw her companion s face as that of a prisonerlooking through bars so it was that through bars bars richlygilt but firmly though discreetly planted charlotte finallystruck her as making a grim attempt from which at first theprincess drew back as instinctively as if the door of the cagehad suddenly been opened from within xxxvithey had been alone that evening alone as a party of six andfour of them after dinner under suggestion not to be resisted sat down to bridge in the smoking room they had passedtogether to that apartment on rising from table charlotte andmrs assingham alike indulgent always to tobacco and in factpractising an emulation which as fanny said would for herself had the colonel not issued an interdict based on the fear of herstealing his cigars have stopped only at the short pipe herecards had with inevitable promptness asserted their rule thegame forming itself as had often happened before of mr ververwith mrs assingham for partner and of the prince with mrs verver the colonel who had then asked of maggie license torelieve his mind of a couple of letters for the earliest post outon the morrow was addressing himself to this task at the otherend of the room and the princess herself had welcomed thecomparatively hushed hour for the bridge players were seriousand silent much in the mood of a tired actress who has the goodfortune to be off while her mates are on almost long enoughfor a nap on the property sofa in the wing maggie s nap had shebeen able to snatch forty winks would have been of the spiritrather than of the sense yet as she subsided near a lamp withthe last salmon coloured french periodical she was to fail forrefreshment even of that sip of independence there was no question for her as she found of closing her eyesand getting away they strayed back to life in the stillness over the top of her review she could lend herself to none ofthose refinements of the higher criticism with which its pagesbristled she was there where her companions were there againand more than ever there it was as if of a sudden they hadbeen made in their personal intensity and their rare complexityof relation freshly importunate to her it was the first eveningthere had been no one else mrs rance and the lutches were duethe next day but meanwhile the facts of the situation wereupright for her round the green cloth and the silver flambeaux the fact of her father s wife s lover facing his mistress thefact of her father sitting all unsounded and unblinking betweenthem the fact of charlotte keeping it up keeping up everything across the table with her husband beside her the fact of fannyassingham wonderful creature placed opposite to the three andknowing more about each probably when one came to think thaneither of them knew of either erect above all for her was thesharp edged fact of the relation of the whole group individuallyand collectively to herself herself so speciously eliminatedfor the hour but presumably more present to the attention ofeach than the next card to be played yes under that imputation to her sense they sat theimputation of wondering beneath and behind all their apparentlystraight play if she weren t really watching them from hercorner and consciously as might be said holding them in herhand she was asking herself at last how they could bear it for though cards were as nought to her and she could follow no move so that she was always on such occasions out of the party theystruck her as conforming alike in the matter of gravity andpropriety to the stiff standard of the house her father sheknew was a high adept one of the greatest she had been ever in her stupidity his small his sole despair amerigo excelledeasily as he understood and practised every art that couldbeguile large leisure mrs assingham and charlotte moreover were accounted as good as members of a sex incapable of thenobler consistency could be therefore evidently they were not all so up to their usual form merely passing it off whether forher or for themselves and the amount of enjoyed or at leastachieved security represented by so complete a conquest ofappearances was what acted on her nerves precisely with a kindof provocative force she found herself for five minutes thrilling with the idea of the prodigious effect that just asshe sat there near them she had at her command with the sensethat if she were but different oh ever so different all thishigh decorum would hang by a hair there reigned for her absolutely during these vertiginous moments that fascination ofthe monstrous that temptation of the horribly possible which weso often trace by its breaking out suddenly lest it should gofurther in unexplained retreats and reactions after it had been thus vividly before her for a little that springing up under her wrong and making them all start stare andturn pale she might sound out their doom in a single sentence asentence easy to choose among several of the lurid after she hadfaced that blinding light and felt it turn to blackness she rosefrom her place laying aside her magazine and moved slowly roundthe room passing near the card players and pausing an instantbehind the chairs in turn silent and discreet she bent a vaguemild face upon them as if to signify that little as shefollowed their doings she wished them well and she took fromeach across the table in the common solemnity an upwardrecognition which she was to carry away with her on her movingout to the terrace a few minutes later her father and herhusband mrs assingham and charlotte had done nothing but meether eyes yet the difference in these demonstrations made each aseparate passage which was all the more wonderful since withthe secret behind every face they had alike tried to look at herthrough it and in denial of it it all left her as she wandered off with the strangest ofimpressions the sense forced upon her as never yet of anappeal a positive confidence from the four pairs of eyes thatwas deeper than any negation and that seemed to speak on thepart of each of some relation to be contrived by her a relationwith herself which would spare the individual the danger theactual present strain of the relation with the others theythus tacitly put it upon her to be disposed of the wholecomplexity of their peril and she promptly saw why because shewas there and there just as she was to lift it off them andtake it to charge herself with it as the scapegoat of old ofwhom she had once seen a terrible picture had been charged withthe sins of the people and had gone forth into the desert to sinkunder his burden and die that indeed wasn t their design andtheir interest that she should sink under hers it wouldn t betheir feeling that she should do anything but live live onsomehow for their benefit and even as much as possible in theircompany to keep proving to them that they had truly escaped andthat she was still there to simplify this idea of hersimplifying and of their combined struggle dim as yet butsteadily growing toward the perception of her adopting it fromthem clung to her while she hovered on the terrace where thesummer night was so soft that she scarce needed the light shawlshe had picked up several of the long windows of the occupiedrooms stood open to it and the light came out in vague shaftsand fell upon the old smooth stones the hour was moonless andstarless and the air heavy and still which was why in herevening dress she need fear no chill and could get away in theouter darkness from that provocation of opportunity which hadassaulted her within on her sofa as a beast might have leapedat her throat nothing in fact was stranger than the way in which when she hadremained there a little her companions watched by her throughone of the windows actually struck her as almost consciously andgratefully safer they might have been really charming as theyshowed in the beautiful room and charlotte certainly as always magnificently handsome and supremely distinguished they mighthave been figures rehearsing some play of which she herself wasthe author they might even for the happy appearance theycontinued to present have been such figures as would by thestrong note of character in each fill any author with thecertitude of success especially of their own histrionic theymight in short have represented any mystery they would the pointbeing predominantly that the key to the mystery the key thatcould wind and unwind it without a snap of the spring was therein her pocket or rather no doubt clasped at this crisis in herhand and pressed as she walked back and forth to her breast she walked to the end and far out of the light she returned andsaw the others still where she had left them she passed roundthe house and looked into the drawing room lighted also butempty now and seeming to speak the more in its own voice ofall the possibilities she controlled spacious and splendid likea stage again awaiting a drama it was a scene she might people by the press of her spring either with serenities and dignitiesand decencies or with terrors and shames and ruins things asugly as those formless fragments of her golden bowl she wastrying so hard to pick up she continued to walk and continued to pause she stopped afreshfor the look into the smoking room and by this time it was asif the recognition had of itself arrested her she saw as in apicture with the temptation she had fled from quite extinct whyit was she had been able to give herself so little from thefirst to the vulgar heat of her wrong she might fairly as shewatched them have missed it as a lost thing have yearned forit for the straight vindictive view the rights of resentment the rages of jealousy the protests of passion as for somethingshe had been cheated of not least a range of feelings which formany women would have meant so much but which for her husband swife for her father s daughter figured nothing nearer toexperience than a wild eastern caravan looming into view withcrude colours in the sun fierce pipes in the air high spearsagainst the sky all a thrill a natural joy to mingle with butturning off short before it reached her and plunging into otherdefiles she saw at all events why horror itself had almostfailed her the horror that foreshadowed in advance would byher thought have made everything that was unaccustomed in hercry out with pain the horror of finding evil seated all at itsease where she had only dreamed of good the horror of the thinghideously behind behind so much trusted so much pretended nobleness cleverness tenderness it was the first sharp falsityshe had known in her life to touch at all or be touched by ithad met her like some bad faced stranger surprised in one of thethick carpeted corridors of a house of quiet on a sundayafternoon and yet yes amazingly she had been able to look atterror and disgust only to know that she must put away from herthe bitter sweet of their freshness the sight from the window of the group so constituted told her why told her how named toher as with hard lips named straight at her so that she musttake it full in the face that other possible relation to thewhole fact which alone would bear upon her irresistibly it wasextraordinary they positively brought home to her that to feelabout them in any of the immediate inevitable assuaging ways the ways usually open to innocence outraged and generositybetrayed would have been to give them up and that giving themup was marvellously not to be thought of she had never fromthe first hour of her state of acquired conviction given them upso little as now though she was no doubt as the consequence ofa step taken a few minutes later to invoke the conception ofdoing that if might be even less she had resumed her walk stopping here and there while she rested on the cool smoothstone balustrade to draw it out in the course of which after alittle she passed again the lights of the empty drawing room andpaused again for what she saw and felt there it was not at once however that this became quite concrete that was the effect of her presently making out that charlottewas in the room launched and erect there in the middle andlooking about her that she had evidently just come round to it from her card table by one of the passages with theexpectation to all appearance of joining her stepdaughter shehad pulled up at seeing the great room empty maggie not havingpassed out on leaving the group in a manner to be observed sodefinite a quest of her with the bridge party interrupted oraltered for it was an impression that fairly assailed theprincess and to which something of attitude and aspect of theair of arrested pursuit and purpose in charlotte together withthe suggestion of her next vague movements quickly added itsmeaning this meaning was that she had decided that she had beeninfinitely conscious of maggie s presence before that she knewthat she would at last find her alone and that she wanted her for some reason enough to have presumably called on bobassingham for aid he had taken her chair and let her go and thearrangement was for maggie a signal proof of her earnestness ofthe energy in fact that though superficially commonplace in asituation in which people weren t supposed to be watching eachother was what affected our young woman on the spot as abreaking of bars the splendid shining supple creature was out ofthe cage was at large and the question now almost grotesquelyrose of whether she mightn t by some art just where she was andbefore she could go further be hemmed in and secured it wouldhave been for a moment in this case a matter of quickly closingthe windows and giving the alarm with poor maggie s sense that though she couldn t know what she wanted of her it was enoughfor trepidation that at these firm hands anything should be tosay nothing of the sequel of a flight taken again along theterrace even under the shame of the confessed feebleness of suchevasions on the part of an outraged wife it was to thisfeebleness none the less that the outraged wife had presentlyresorted the most that could be said for her being as she feltwhile she finally stopped short at a distance that she could atany rate resist her abjection sufficiently not to sneak into thehouse by another way and safely reach her room she had literallycaught herself in the act of dodging and ducking and it told herthere vividly in a single word what she had all along beenmost afraid of she had been afraid of the particular passage with charlotte thatwould determine her father s wife to take him into her confidenceas she couldn t possibly as yet have done to prepare for him astatement of her wrong to lay before him the infamy of what shewas apparently suspected of this should she have made up hermind to do it would rest on a calculation the thought of whichevoked strangely other possibilities and visions it would showher as sufficiently believing in her grasp of her husband to beable to assure herself that with his daughter thrown on thedefensive with maggie s cause and maggie s word in fine against her own it wasn t maggie s that would most certainlycarry the day such a glimpse of her conceivable idea whichwould be founded on reasons all her own reasons of experienceand assurance impenetrable to others but intimately familiar toherself such a glimpse opened out wide as soon as it had comeinto view for if so much as this was still firm ground betweenthe elder pair if the beauty of appearances had been soconsistently preserved it was only the golden bowl as maggieherself knew it that had been broken the breakage stood not forany wrought discomposure among the triumphant three it stoodmerely for the dire deformity of her attitude toward them shewas unable at the minute of course fully to measure thedifference thus involved for her and it remained inevitably anagitating image the way it might be held over her that if shedidn t of her own prudence satisfy charlotte as to thereference in her mocking spirit of so much of the unuttered andunutterable of the constantly and unmistakably implied herfather would be invited without further ceremony to recommend herto do so but any confidence any latent operating insolence that mrs verver should thanks to her large native resources continue to be possessed of and to hold in reserve glimmeredsuddenly as a possible working light and seemed to offer formeeting her a new basis and something like a new system maggie felt truly a rare contraction of the heart on makingout the next instant what the new system would probably have tobe and she had practically done that before perceiving that thething she feared had already taken place charlotte extendingher search appeared now to define herself vaguely in thedistance of this after an instant the princess was sure though the darkness was thick for the projected clearness of thesmoking room windows had presently contributed its help herfriend came slowly into that circle having also for herself bythis time not indistinguishably discovered that maggie was onthe terrace maggie from the end saw her stop before one of thewindows to look at the group within and then saw her come nearerand pause again still with a considerable length of the placebetween them yes charlotte had seen she was watching her from afar and hadstopped now to put her further attention to the test her facewas fixed on her through the night she was the creature who hadescaped by force from her cage yet there was in her whole motionassuredly even as so dimly discerned a kind of portentousintelligent stillness she had escaped with an intention butwith an intention the more definite that it could so accord withquiet measures the two women at all events only hovered there for these first minutes face to face over their interval andexchanging no sign the intensity of their mutual look might havepierced the night and maggie was at last to start with thescared sense of having thus yielded to doubt to dread tohesitation for a time that with no other proof needed wouldhave completely given her away how long had she stood staring a single minute or five long enough in any case to have feltherself absolutely take from her visitor something that thelatter threw upon her irresistibly by this effect of silence by this effect of waiting and watching by this effect unmistakably of timing her indecision and her fear if then scared and hanging back she had as was so evident sacrificedall past pretences it would have been with the instant knowledgeof an immense advantage gained that charlotte finally saw hercome on maggie came on with her heart in her hands she came onwith the definite prevision throbbing like the tick of a watch of a doom impossibly sharp and hard but to which after lookingat it with her eyes wide open she had none the less bowed herhead by the time she was at her companion s side for thatmatter by the time charlotte had without a motion without aword simply let her approach and stand there her head wasalready on the block so that the consciousness that everythinghad now gone blurred all perception of whether or no the axe hadfallen oh the advantage it was perfectly enough in truth with mrs verver for what was maggie s own sense but that ofhaving been thrown over on her back with her neck from thefirst half broken and her helpless face staring up thatposition only could account for the positive grimace of weaknessand pain produced there by charlotte s dignity i ve come to join you i thought you would be here oh yes i m here maggie heard herself return a little flatly it s too close in doors very but close even here charlotte was still and grave shehad even uttered her remark about the temperature with anexpressive weight that verged upon solemnity so that maggie reduced to looking vaguely about at the sky could only feel hernot fail of her purpose the air s heavy as if with thunder ithink there ll be a storm she made the suggestion to carry offan awkwardness which was a part always of her companion sgain but the awkwardness didn t diminish in the silence thatfollowed charlotte had said nothing in reply her brow was darkas with a fixed expression and her high elegance her handsomehead and long straight neck testified through the dusk totheir inveterate completeness and noble erectness it was as ifwhat she had come out to do had already begun and when as aconsequence maggie had said helplessly don t you wantsomething won t you have my shawl everything might havecrumbled away in the comparative poverty of the tribute mrs verver s rejection of it had the brevity of a sign that theyhadn t closed in for idle words just as her dim serious face uninterruptedly presented until they moved again might haverepresented the success with which she watched all her messagepenetrate they presently went back the way she had come but shestopped maggie again within range of the smoking room window andmade her stand where the party at cards would be before her sideby side for three minutes they fixed this picture of quietharmonies the positive charm of it and as might have been said the full significance which as was now brought home to maggie could be no more after all than a matter of interpretation differing always for a different interpreter as she herself hadhovered in sight of it a quarter of an hour before it would havebeen a thing for her to show charlotte to show in righteousirony in reproach too stern for anything but silence but now itwas she who was being shown it and shown it by charlotte andshe saw quickly enough that as charlotte showed it so she mustat present submissively seem to take it the others were absorbed and unconscious either silent overtheir game or dropping remarks unheard on the terrace and it wasto her father s quiet face discernibly expressive of nothingthat was in his daughter s mind that our young woman s attentionwas most directly given his wife and his daughter were bothclosely watching him and to which of them could he have beennotified of this would his raised eyes first all impulsively have responded in which of them would he have felt it mostimportant to destroy for his clutch at the equilibrium any germof uneasiness not yet since his marriage had maggie so sharplyand so formidably known her old possession of him as a thingdivided and contested she was looking at him by charlotte sleave and under charlotte s direction quite in fact as if theparticular way she should look at him were prescribed to her quite even as if she had been defied to look at him in anyother it came home to her too that the challenge wasn t asmight be said in his interest and for his protection but pressingly insistently in charlotte s for that of her securityat any price she might verily by this dumb demonstration havebeen naming to maggie the price naming it as a question formaggie herself a sum of money that she properly was to find she must remain safe and maggie must pay what she was to paywith being her own affair straighter than ever thus the princess again felt it all putupon her and there was a minute just a supreme instant duringwhich there burned in her a wild wish that her father would onlylook up it throbbed for these seconds as a yearning appeal tohim she would chance it that is if he would but just raise hiseyes and catch them across the larger space standing in theouter dark together then he might be affected by the sight taking them as they were he might make some sign she scarceknew what that would save her save her from being the one thisway to pay all he might somehow show a preference distinguishing between them might out of pity for her signalto her that this extremity of her effort for him was more than heasked that represented maggie s one little lapse fromconsistency the sole small deflection in the whole course of herscheme it had come to nothing the next minute for the dearman s eyes had never moved and charlotte s hand promptly passedinto her arm had already had very firmly drawn her on quite for that matter as from some sudden some equal perception onher part too of the more ways than one in which their impressioncould appeal they retraced their steps along the rest of theterrace turning the corner of the house and presently cameabreast of the other windows those of the pompous drawing room still lighted and still empty here charlotte again paused andit was again as if she were pointing out what maggie had observedfor herself the very look the place had of being vivid in itsstillness of having with all its great objects as ordered andbalanced as for a formal reception been appointed for some hightransaction some real affair of state in presence of thisopportunity she faced her companion once more she traced in herthe effect of everything she had already communicated shesignified with the same success that the terrace and the sullennight would bear too meagre witness to the completion of heridea soon enough then within the room under the old lustres ofvenice and the eyes of the several great portraits more or lesscontemporary with these that awaited on the walls of fawns theirfinal far migration soon enough maggie found herself staring and at first all too gaspingly at the grand total to which eachseparate demand mrs verver had hitherto made upon her howevershe had made it now amounted i ve been wanting and longer than you d perhaps believe to puta question to you for which no opportunity has seemed to me yetquite so good as this it would have been easier perhaps if youhad struck me as in the least disposed ever to give me one ihave to take it now you see as i find it they stood in thecentre of the immense room and maggie could feel that the sceneof life her imagination had made of it twenty minutes before wasby this time sufficiently peopled these few straight wordsfilled it to its uttermost reaches and nothing was now absentfrom her consciousness either of the part she was called uponto play in it charlotte had marched straight in dragging herrich train she rose there beautiful and free with her wholeaspect and action attuned to the firmness of her speech maggiehad kept the shawl she had taken out with her and clutching ittight in her nervousness drew it round her as if huddling in itfor shelter covering herself with it for humility she lookedout as from under an improvised hood the sole headgear of somepoor woman at somebody s proud door she waited even like thepoor woman she met her friend s eyes with recognitions shecouldn t suppress she might sound it as she could whatquestion then everything in her from head to foot crowded itupon charlotte that she knew she knew too well that she wasshowing so that successful vagueness to save some scrap of herdignity from the imminence of her defeat was already a lostcause and the one thing left was if possible at any cost eventhat of stupid inconsequence to try to look as if she weren tafraid if she could but appear at all not afraid she mightappear a little not ashamed that is not ashamed to be afraid which was the kind of shame that could be fastened on her itbeing fear all the while that moved her her challenge at anyrate her wonder her terror the blank blurred surface whatever it was that she presented became a mixture that ceasedto signify for to the accumulated advantage by which charlottewas at present sustained her next words themselves had little toadd have you any ground of complaint of me is there any wrong youconsider i ve done you i feel at last that i ve a right to askyou their eyes had to meet on it and to meet long maggie s avoidedat least the disgrace of looking away what makes you want toask it my natural desire to know you ve done that for so long littlejustice maggie waited a moment for so long you mean you vethought i mean my dear that i ve seen i ve seen week after week that you seemed to be thinking of something that perplexed orworried you is it anything for which i m in any degreeresponsible maggie summoned all her powers what in the world should it be ah that s not for me to imagine and i should be very sorry tohave to try to say i m aware of no point whatever at which i mayhave failed you said charlotte nor of any at which i may havefailed any one in whom i can suppose you sufficiently interestedto care if i ve been guilty of some fault i ve committed it allunconsciously and am only anxious to hear from you honestlyabout it but if i ve been mistaken as to what i speak of thedifference more and more marked as i ve thought in all yourmanner to me why obviously so much the better no form ofcorrection received from you could give me greater satisfaction she spoke it struck her companion with rising withextraordinary ease as if hearing herself say it all besidesseeing the way it was listened to helped her from point topoint she saw she was right that this was the tone for her totake and the thing for her to do the thing as to which she wasprobably feeling that she had in advance in her delays anduncertainties much exaggerated the difficulty the difficultywas small and it grew smaller as her adversary continued toshrink she was not only doing as she wanted but had by thistime effectively done it and hung it up all of which butdeepened maggie s sense of the sharp and simple need now ofseeing her through to the end if you ve been mistaken yousay and the princess but barely faltered you have beenmistaken charlotte looked at her splendidly hard you re perfectly sureit s all my mistake all i can say is that you ve received a false impression ah then so much the better from the moment i had received it iknew i must sooner or later speak of it for that you see is systematically my way and now charlotte added you make meglad i ve spoken i thank you very much it was strange how for maggie too with this the difficultyseemed to sink her companion s acceptance of her denial was likea general pledge not to keep things any worse for her than theyessentially had to be it positively helped her to build up herfalsehood to which accordingly she contributed another block i ve affected you evidently quite accidentally in some way ofwhich i ve been all unaware i ve not felt at any time thatyou ve wronged me how could i come within a mile charlotte inquired of such apossibility maggie with her eyes on her more easily now made no attempt tosay she said after a little something more to the presentpoint i accuse you i accuse you of nothing ah that s lucky charlotte had brought this out with the richness almost ofgaiety and maggie to go on had to think with her ownintensity of amerigo to think how he on his side had had togo through with his lie to her how it was for his wife he haddone so and how his doing so had given her the clue and set herthe example he must have had his own difficulty about it andshe was not after all falling below him it was in fact as if thanks to her hovering image of him confronted with thisadmirable creature even as she was confronted there glowed uponher from afar yet straight and strong a deep explanatory lightwhich covered the last inch of the ground he had given hersomething to conform to and she hadn t unintelligently turned onhim gone back on him as he would have said by notconforming they were together thus he and she close closetogether whereas charlotte though rising there radiantly beforeher was really off in some darkness of space that would steepher in solitude and harass her with care the heart of theprincess swelled accordingly even in her abasement she hadkept in tune with the right and something certainly somethingthat might be like a rare flower snatched from an impossibleledge would and possibly soon come of it for her the right the right yes it took this extraordinary form of herhumbugging as she had called it to the end it was only aquestion of not by a hair s breadth deflecting into the truth so supremely was she braced you must take it from me thatyour anxiety rests quite on a misconception you must take itfrom me that i ve never at any moment fancied i could suffer byyou and marvellously she kept it up not only kept it up butimproved on it you must take it from me that i ve never thoughtof you but as beautiful wonderful and good which is all ithink that you can possibly ask charlotte held her a moment longer she needed not then to haveappeared only tactless the last word it s much more my dear than i dreamed of asking i only wanted your denial well then you have it upon your honour upon my honour and she made a point even our young woman of not turning away her grip of her shawl had loosened she had let it fall behindher but she stood there for anything more and till the weightshould be lifted with which she saw soon enough what more was tocome she saw it in charlotte s face and felt it make betweenthem in the air a chill that completed the coldness of theirconscious perjury will you kiss me on it then she couldn t say yes but she didn t say no what availed herstill however was to measure in her passivity how much toofar charlotte had come to retreat but there was somethingdifferent also something for which while her cheek received theprodigious kiss she had her opportunity the sight of theothers who having risen from their cards to join the absentmembers of their party had reached the open door at the end ofthe room and stopped short evidently in presence of thedemonstration that awaited them her husband and her father werein front and charlotte s embrace of her which wasn t to bedistinguished for them either she felt from her embrace ofcharlotte took on with their arrival a high publicity xxxviiher father had asked her three days later in an interval ofcalm how she was affected in the light of their reappearanceand of their now perhaps richer fruition by dotty and kitty andby the once formidable mrs rance and the consequence of thisinquiry had been for the pair just such another strolltogether away from the rest of the party and off into the park as had asserted its need to them on the occasion of the previousvisit of these anciently more agitating friends that of theirlong talk on a sequestered bench beneath one of the great trees when the particular question had come up for them the thenpurblind discussion of which at their enjoyed leisure maggiehad formed the habit of regarding as the first beginning oftheir present situation the whirligig of time had thus broughtround for them again on their finding themselves face to facewhile the others were gathering for tea on the terrace the sameodd impulse quietly to slope so adam verver himself as theywent familiarly expressed it that had acted in its way ofold acted for the distant autumn afternoon and for the sharpnessof their since so outlived crisis it might have been funny tothem now that the presence of mrs rance and the lutches andwith symptoms too at that time less developed had once fortheir anxiety and their prudence constituted a crisis it mighthave been funny that these ladies could ever have figured totheir imagination as a symbol of dangers vivid enough toprecipitate the need of a remedy this amount of entertainmentand assistance they were indeed disposed to extract from theiractual impressions they had been finding it for months past bymaggie s view a resource and a relief to talk with an approachto intensity when they met of all the people they weren treally thinking of and didn t really care about the people withwhom their existence had begun almost to swarm and they closedin at present round the spectres of their past as they permittedthemselves to describe the three ladies with a better imitationof enjoying their theme than they had been able to achieve certainly during the stay for instance of the castledeans thecastledeans were a new joke comparatively and they had had always to maggie s view to teach themselves the way of it whereas the detroit the providence party rebounding so fromprovidence from detroit was an old and ample one of which themost could be made and as to which a humorous insistence could beguarded sharp and sudden moreover this afternoon had been theirwell nigh confessed desire just to rest together a little asfrom some strain long felt but never named to rest as whoshould say shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand each pair ofeyes so yearningly and indeed what could it be but so wearily closed as to render the collapse safe from detection by the otherpair it was positively as if in short the inward felicity oftheir being once more perhaps only for half an hour simplydaughter and father had glimmered out for them and they hadpicked up the pretext that would make it easiest they werehusband and wife oh so immensely as regards other persons but after they had dropped again on their old bench consciousthat the party on the terrace augmented as in the past byneighbours would do beautifully without them it was wonderfullylike their having got together into some boat and paddled offfrom the shore where husbands and wives luxuriant complications made the air too tropical in the boat they were father anddaughter and poor dotty and kitty supplied abundantly for theirsituation the oars or the sail why into the bargain for thatmatter this came to maggie couldn t they always live so far asthey lived together in a boat she felt in her face with thequestion the breath of a possibility that soothed her theyneeded only know each other henceforth in the unmarriedrelation that other sweet evening in the same place he hadbeen as unmarried as possible which had kept down so to speak the quantity of change in their state well then that othersweet evening was what the present sweet evening would resemble with the quite calculable effect of an exquisite inwardrefreshment they had after all whatever happened always andever each other each other that was the hidden treasure and thesaving truth to do exactly what they would with a provisionfull of possibilities who could tell as yet what thanks toit they wouldn t have done before the end they had meanwhile been tracing together in the golden air that toward six o clock of a july afternoon hung about the massedkentish woods several features of the social evolution of herold playmates still beckoned on it would seem by unattainableideals still falling back beyond the sea to their nativeseats for renewals of the moral financial conversational onescarce knew what to call it outfit and again and for everreappearing like a tribe of wandering jewesses our couple hadfinally exhausted however the study of these annals and maggiewas to take up after a drop a different matter or one at leastwith which the immediate connection was not at first apparent were you amused at me just now when i wondered what otherpeople could wish to struggle for did you think me she askedwith some earnestness well fatuous fatuous he seemed at a loss i mean sublime in our happiness as if looking down from aheight or rather sublime in our general position that s whati mean she spoke as from the habit of her anxious consciencesomething that disposed her frequently to assure herself for herhuman commerce of the state of the books of the spirit because i don t at all want she explained to be blinded ormade sniffy by any sense of a social situation her fatherlistened to this declaration as if the precautions of her generalmercy could still as they betrayed themselves have surprisesfor him to say nothing of a charm of delicacy and beauty hemight have been wishing to see how far she could go and where shewould all touchingly to him arrive but she waited a little asif made nervous precisely by feeling him depend too much onwhat she said they were avoiding the serious standing off anxiously from the real and they fell again and again as ifto disguise their precaution itself into the tone of the timethat came back to them from their other talk when they hadshared together this same refuge don t you remember she wenton how when they were here before i broke it to you that iwasn t so very sure we ourselves had the thing itself he did his best to do so had you mean a social situation yes after fanny assingham had first broken it to me that atthe rate we were going we should never have one which was what put us on charlotte oh yes they had had itover quite often enough for him easily to remember maggie had another pause taking it from him that he now couldboth affirm and admit without wincing that they had been attheir critical moment put on charlotte it was as if thisrecognition had been threshed out between them as fundamental tothe honest view of their success well she continued irecall how i felt about kitty and dotty that even if we hadalready then been more placed or whatever you may call what weare now it still wouldn t have been an excuse for wondering whyothers couldn t obligingly leave me more exalted by having themselves smaller ideas for those she said were thefeelings we used to have oh yes he responded philosophically i remember the feelingswe used to have maggie appeared to wish to plead for them a little in tenderretrospect as if they had been also respectable it was badenough i thought to have no sympathy in your heart when you hada position but it was worse to be sublime about it as i was soafraid as i m in fact still afraid of being when it wasn t eventhere to support one and she put forth again the earnestnessshe might have been taking herself as having outlived became forit which was doubtless too often even now her danger almostsententious one must always whether or no have someimagination of the states of others of what they may feeldeprived of however she added kitty and dotty couldn timagine we were deprived of anything and now and now butshe stopped as for indulgence to their wonder and envy and now they see still more that we can have got everything and kept everything and yet not be proud no we re not proud she answered after a moment i m not surethat we re quite proud enough yet she changed the next instantthat subject too she could only do so however by harkingback as if it had been a fascination she might have beenwishing under this renewed this still more suggestivevisitation to keep him with her for remounting the stream oftime and dipping again for the softness of the water into thecontracted basin of the past we talked about it we talkedabout it you don t remember so well as i you too didn t know and it was beautiful of you like kitty and dotty you too thoughtwe had a position and were surprised when i thought we oughtto have told them we weren t doing for them what they supposed in fact maggie pursued we re not doing it now we re not yousee really introducing them i mean not to the people theywant then what do you call the people with whom they re now havingtea it made her quite spring round that s just what you asked methe other time one of the days there was somebody and i toldyou i didn t call anybody anything i remember that such people the people we made so welcome didn t count that fanny assingham knew they didn t she hadawakened his daughter the echo and on the bench there asbefore he nodded his head amusedly he kept nervously shakinghis foot yes they were only good enough the people who came for us i remember he said again that was the way it allhappened that was the way that was the way and you asked me maggieadded if i didn t think we ought to tell them tell mrs rance in particular i mean that we had been entertaining her up tothen under false pretences precisely but you said she wouldn t have understood to which you replied that in that case you were like her youdidn t understand no no but i remember how about our having in our benightedinnocence no position you quite crushed me with yourexplanation well then said maggie with every appearance of delight i llcrush you again i told you that you by yourself had one therewas no doubt of that you were different from me you had thesame one you always had and then i asked you her father concurred why in that caseyou hadn t the same then indeed you did he had brought her face round to himbefore and this held it covering him with its kindledbrightness the result of the attested truth of their being ablethus in talk to live again together what i replied was that ihad lost my position by my marriage that one i know how isaw it would never come back i had done something to it ididn t quite know what given it away somehow and yet not asthen appeared really got my return i had been assured alwaysby dear fanny that i could get it only i must wake up so i wastrying you see to wake up trying very hard yes and to a certain extent you succeeded as also in wakingme but you made much he said of your difficulty to whichhe added it s the only case i remember mag of you ever makinganything of a difficulty she kept her eyes on him a moment that i was so happy as iwas that you were so happy as you were well you admitted maggie kept it up that that was a gooddifficulty you confessed that our life did seem to bebeautiful he thought a moment yes i may very well have confessed it forso it did seem to me but he guarded himself with his dim hiseasier smile what do you want to put on me now only that we used to wonder that we were wondering then if ourlife wasn t perhaps a little selfish this also for a time muchat his leisure adam verver retrospectively fixed because fannyassingham thought so oh no she never thought she couldn t think if she would anything of that sort she only thinks people are sometimesfools maggie developed she doesn t seem to think so muchabout their being wrong wrong that is in the sense of beingwicked she doesn t the princess further adventured quite somuch mind their being wicked i see i see and yet it might have been for his daughter thathe didn t so very vividly see then she only thought us fools oh no i don t say that i m speaking of our being selfish and that comes under the head of the wickedness fanny condones oh i don t say she condones a scruple in maggie raised itscrest besides i m speaking of what was her father showed however after a little that he had not beenreached by this discrimination his thoughts were resting for themoment where they had settled look here mag he saidreflectively i ain t selfish i ll be blowed if i m selfish well maggie if he would talk of that could also pronounce then father i am oh shucks said adam verver to whom the vernacular in momentsof deepest sincerity could thus come back i ll believe it hepresently added when amerigo complains of you ah it s just he who s my selfishness i m selfish so to speak for him i mean she continued that he s my motive ineverything well her father could from experience fancy what she meant but hasn t a girl a right to be selfish about her husband what i don t mean she observed without answering is that i mjealous of him but that s his merit it s not mine her father again seemed amused at her you could be otherwise oh how can i talk she asked of otherwise it isn t luckilyfor me otherwise if everything were different she furtherpresented her thought of course everything would be and thenagain as if that were but half my idea is this that when youonly love a little you re naturally not jealous or are onlyjealous also a little so that it doesn t matter but when youlove in a deeper and intenser way then you are in the sameproportion jealous your jealousy has intensity and no doubt ferocity when however you love in the most abysmal andunutterable way of all why then you re beyond everything andnothing can pull you down mr verver listened as if he had nothing on these high lines tooppose and that s the way you love for a minute she failed to speak but at last she answered itwasn t to talk about that i do feel however beyond everything and as a consequence of that i dare say she added with aturn to gaiety seem often not to know quite where i am the mere fine pulse of passion in it the suggestion as of acreature consciously floating and shining in a warm summer sea some element of dazzling sapphire and silver a creature cradledupon depths buoyant among dangers in which fear or folly orsinking otherwise than in play was impossible something of allthis might have been making once more present to him with hisdiscreet his half shy assent to it her probable enjoyment of arapture that he in his day had presumably convinced no greatnumber of persons either of his giving or of his receiving hesat awhile as if he knew himself hushed almost admonished andnot for the first time yet it was an effect that might havebrought before him rather what she had gained than what he hadmissed besides who but himself really knew what he after all hadn t or even had gained the beauty of her condition was keeping him at any rate as he might feel in sight of the sea where thoughhis personal dips were over the whole thing could shine at him and the air and the plash and the play become for him too asensation that couldn t be fixed upon him as missing since ifit wasn t personally floating if it wasn t even sitting in thesand it could yet pass very well for breathing the bliss in acommunicated irresistible way for tasting the balm it couldpass further for knowing for knowing that without him nothingmight have been which would have been missing least of all i guess i ve never been jealous he finally remarked and itsaid more to her he had occasion next to perceive than he wasintending for it made her as by the pressure of a spring givehim a look that seemed to tell of things she couldn t speak but she at last tried for one of them oh it s you father whoare what i call beyond everything nothing can pull you down he returned the look as with the sociability of their easycommunion though inevitably throwing in this time a shade ofsolemnity he might have been seeing things to say and others whether of a type presumptuous or not doubtless better keptback so he settled on the merely obvious well then we make apair we re all right oh we re all right a declaration launched not only with allher discriminating emphasis but confirmed by her rising withdecision and standing there as if the object of their smallexcursion required accordingly no further pursuit at thisjuncture however with the act of their crossing the bar toget as might be into port there occurred the only approach toa betrayal of their having had to beat against the wind herfather kept his place and it was as if she had got over firstand were pausing for her consort to follow if they were allright they were all right yet he seemed to hesitate and waitfor some word beyond his eyes met her own suggestively and itwas only after she had contented herself with simply smiling athim smiling ever so fixedly that he spoke for the remainingimportance of it from the bench where he leaned back raisinghis face to her his legs thrust out a trifle wearily and hishands grasping either side of the seat they had beaten againstthe wind and she was still fresh they had beaten against thewind and he as at the best the more battered vessel perhapsjust vaguely drooped but the effect of their silence was thatshe appeared to beckon him on and he might have been fairlyalongside of her when at the end of another minute he foundtheir word the only thing is that as for ever putting up againwith your pretending that you re selfish at this she helped him out with it you won t take it from me i won t take it from you well of course you won t for that s your way it doesn tmatter and it only proves but it doesn t matter either whatit proves i m at this very moment she declared frozen stiffwith selfishness he faced her awhile longer in the same way it was strangely asif by this sudden arrest by their having in their acceptanceof the unsaid or at least their reference to it practicallygiven up pretending it was as if they were in for it forsomething they had been ineffably avoiding but the dread ofwhich was itself in a manner a seduction just as anyconfession of the dread was by so much an allusion then sheseemed to see him let himself go when a person s of the natureyou speak of there are always other persons to suffer but you vejust been describing to me what you d take if you had once agood chance from your husband oh i m not talking about my husband then whom are you talking about both the retort and the rejoinder had come quicker than anythingpreviously exchanged and they were followed on maggie s part by a momentary drop but she was not to fall away and while hercompanion kept his eyes on her while she wondered if he weren texpecting her to name his wife then with high hypocrisy aspaying for his daughter s bliss she produced something that shefelt to be much better i m talking about you do you mean i ve been your victim of course you ve been my victim what have you done ever done that hasn t been for me many things more than i can tell you things you ve only tothink of for yourself what do you make of all that i ve done formyself yourself she brightened out with derision what do you make of what i ve done for american city it took her but a moment to say i m not talking of you as apublic character i m talking of you on your personal side well american city if personalities can do it has given mea pretty personal side what do you make he went on of whati ve done for my reputation your reputation there you ve given it up to them the awfulpeople for less than nothing you ve given it up to them to tearto pieces to make their horrible vulgar jokes against you with ah my dear i don t care for their horrible vulgar jokes adamverver almost artlessly urged then there exactly you are she triumphed everything thattouches you everything that surrounds you goes on by yoursplendid indifference and your incredible permission at yourexpense just as he had been sitting he looked at her an instant longer then he slowly rose while his hands stole into his pockets andstood there before her of course my dear you go on at myexpense it has never been my idea he smiled that you shouldwork for your living i wouldn t have liked to see it withwhich for a little again they remained face to face saytherefore i have had the feelings of a father how have they mademe a victim because i sacrifice you but to what in the world at this it hung before her that she should have had as never yether opportunity to say and it held her for a minute as in avise her impression of his now with his strained smile whichtouched her to deepest depths sounding her in his secret unrest this was the moment in the whole process of their mutualvigilance in which it decidedly most hung by a hair that theirthin wall might be pierced by the lightest wrong touch it shookbetween them this transparency with their very breath it wasan exquisite tissue but stretched on a frame and would give waythe next instant if either so much as breathed too hard she heldher breath for she knew by his eyes the light at the heart ofwhich he couldn t blind that he was by his intention makingsure sure whether or no her certainty was like his theintensity of his dependence on it at that moment this itself waswhat absolutely convinced her so that as if perched up beforehim on her vertiginous point and in the very glare of hisobservation she balanced for thirty seconds she almost rocked she might have been for the time in all her conscious person the very form of the equilibrium they were in their differentways equally trying to save and they were saving it yes theywere or at least she was that was still the workable issue shecould say as she felt her dizziness drop she held herself hard the thing was to be done once for all by her acting now whereshe stood so much was crowded into so short a space that sheknew already she was keeping her head she had kept it by thewarning of his eyes she shouldn t lose it again she knew howand why and if she had turned cold this was precisely whathelped her he had said to himself she ll break down and nameamerigo she ll say it s to him she s sacrificing me and its bywhat that will give me with so many other things too that mysuspicion will be clinched he was watching her lips spying forthe symptoms of the sound whereby these symptoms had only tofail and he would have got nothing that she didn t measure out tohim as she gave it she had presently in fact so recoveredherself that she seemed to know she could more easily have madehim name his wife than he have made her name her husband it wasthere before her that if she should so much as force him just notconsciously to avoid saying charlotte charlotte he would havegiven himself away but to be sure of this was enough for her and she saw more clearly with each lapsing instant what they wereboth doing he was doing what he had steadily been coming to hewas practically offering himself pressing himself upon her as asacrifice he had read his way so into her best possibility andwhere had she already for weeks and days past planted her feetif not on her acceptance of the offer cold indeed colder andcolder she turned as she felt herself suffer this close personalvision of his attitude still not to make her weaken that was hervery certitude the intensity of his pressure for if somethingdreadful hadn t happened there wouldn t for either of them bethese dreadful things to do she had meanwhile as well theimmense advantage that she could have named charlotte withoutexposing herself as for that matter she was the next minuteshowing him why i sacrifice you simply to everything and to every one itake the consequences of your marriage as perfectly natural he threw back his head a little settling with one hand hiseyeglass what do you call my dear the consequences your life as your marriage has made it well hasn t it made it exactly what we wanted she justhesitated then felt herself steady oh beyond what she haddreamed exactly what i wanted yes his eyes through his straightened glasses were still on hers and he might with his intenser fixed smile have been knowingshe was for herself rightly inspired what do you make then ofwhat i wanted i don t make anything any more than of what you ve got that sexactly the point i don t put myself out to do so i never have i take from you all i can get all you ve provided for me and ileave you to make of your own side of the matter what you can there you are the rest is your own affair i don t even pretendto concern myself to concern yourself he watched her as she faintly faltered looking about her now so as not to keep always meeting his face with what may have really become of you it s as if we hadagreed from the first not to go into that such an arrangementbeing of course charming for me you can t say you know that ihaven t stuck to it he didn t say so then even with the opportunity given him of herstopping once more to catch her breath he said instead oh mydear oh oh but it made no difference know as she might what a past stillso recent and yet so distant it alluded to she repeated herdenial warning him off on her side from spoiling the truth ofher contention i never went into anything and you see i don t i ve continued to adore you but what s that from a decentdaughter to such a father what but a question of convenientarrangement our having two houses three houses instead of one you would have arranged for fifty if i had wished and mymaking it easy for you to see the child you don t claim isuppose that my natural course once you had set up foryourself would have been to ship you back to american city these were direct inquiries they quite rang out in the soft wooded air so that adam verver for a minute appeared to meetthem with reflection she saw reflection however quickly enoughshow him what to do with them do you know mag what you makeme wish when you talk that way and he waited again while shefurther got from him the sense of something that had been behind deeply in the shade coming cautiously to the front and justfeeling its way before presenting itself you regularly make mewish that i had shipped back to american city when you go on asyou do but he really had to hold himself to say it well when i go on why you make me quite want to ship back myself you make mequite feel as if american city would be the best place for us it made her all too finely vibrate for us for me and charlotte do you know that if we should ship itwould serve you quite right with which he smiled oh he smiled and if you say much more we will ship ah then it was that the cup of her conviction full to the brim overflowed at a touch there was his idea the clearness of whichfor an instant almost dazzled her it was a blur of light in themidst of which she saw charlotte like some object marked bycontrast in blackness saw her waver in the field of vision sawher removed transported doomed and he had named charlotte named her again and she had made him which was all she hadneeded more it was as if she had held a blank letter to the fireand the writing had come out still larger than she hoped therecognition of it took her some seconds but she might when shespoke have been folding up these precious lines and restoringthem to her pocket well i shall be as much as ever then thecause of what you do i haven t the least doubt of your being upto that if you should think i might get anything out of it eventhe little pleasure she laughed of having said as you callit more let my enjoyment of this therefore at any price continue to represent for you what i call sacrificing you she had drawn a long breath she had made him do it all for her and had lighted the way to it without his naming her husband that silence had been as distinct as the sharp the inevitablesound and something now in him followed it up a sudden air asof confessing at last fully to where she was and of begging theparticular question don t you think then i can take care ofmyself ah it s exactly what i ve gone upon if it wasn t for that but she broke off and they remained only another moment face toface i ll let you know my dear the day i feel you ve begunto sacrifice me begun she extravagantly echoed well it will be for me the day you ve ceased to believe inme with which his glasses still fixed on her his hands in hispockets his hat pushed back his legs a little apart he seemedto plant or to square himself for a kind of assurance it hadoccurred to him he might as well treat her to in default ofother things before they changed their subject it had theeffect for her of a reminder a reminder of all he was of allhe had done of all above and beyond his being her perfectlittle father she might take him as representing take him ashaving quite eminently in the eyes of two hemispheres beencapable of and as therefore wishing not was it illegitimately to call her attention to the successful beneficent person the beautiful bountiful original dauntlessly wilful great citizen the consummate collector andinfallible high authority he had been and still was these thingsstruck her on the spot as making up for him in a wonderfulway a character she must take into account in dealing with himeither for pity or for envy he positively under the impression seemed to loom larger than life for her so that she saw himduring these moments in a light of recognition which had had itsbrightness for her at many an hour of the past but which hadnever been so intense and so almost admonitory his veryquietness was part of it now as always part of everything ofhis success his originality his modesty his exquisite publicperversity his inscrutable incalculable energy and thisquality perhaps it might be all the more too as the result forthe present occasion of an admirable traceable effort thatplaced him in her eyes as no precious a work of art probably hadever been placed in his own there was a long moment absolutely during which her impression rose and rose even as that of thetypical charmed gazer in the still museum before the named anddated object the pride of the catalogue that time has polishedand consecrated extraordinary in particular was the number ofthe different ways in which he thus affected her as showing hewas strong that was the great thing he was sure sure forhimself always whatever his idea the expression of that in himhad somehow never appeared more identical with his proved tastefor the rare and the true but what stood out beyond everythingwas that he was always marvellously young which couldn t butcrown at this juncture his whole appeal to her imagination before she knew it she was lifted aloft by the consciousness thathe was simply a great and deep and high little man and that tolove him with tenderness was not to be distinguished a whit from loving him with pride it came to her all strangely as asudden an immense relief the sense that he wasn t a failure and could never be purged their predicament of every meanness made it as if they had really emerged in their transmuted union to smile almost without pain it was like a new confidence andafter another instant she knew even still better why wasn t itbecause now also on his side he was thinking of her as hisdaughter was trying her during these mute seconds as the childof his blood oh then if she wasn t with her little consciouspassion the child of any weakness what was she but strongenough too it swelled in her fairly it raised her higher higher she wasn t in that case a failure either hadn t been but the contrary his strength was her strength her pride washis and they were decent and competent together this was all inthe answer she finally made him i believe in you more than any one than any one at all she hesitated for all it might mean but there was oh athousand times no doubt of it than any one at all she keptnothing of it back now met his eyes over it let him have thewhole of it after which she went on and that s the way ithink you believe in me he looked at her a minute longer but his tone at last was right about the way yes well then she spoke as for the end and for other matters for anything everything else there might be they would neverreturn to it well then his hands came out and while her own took them hedrew her to his breast and held her he held her hard and kepther long and she let herself go but it was an embrace that august and almost stern produced for all its intimacy norevulsion and broke into no inconsequence of tears xxxviiimaggie was to feel after this passage how they had both beenhelped through it by the influence of that accident of her havingbeen caught a few nights before in the familiar embrace of herfather s wife his return to the saloon had chanced to coincideexactly with this demonstration missed moreover neither by herhusband nor by the assinghams who their card party suspended had quitted the billiard room with him she had been consciousenough at the time of what such an impression received by theothers might in that extended state do for her case and nonethe less that as no one had appeared to wish to be the first tomake a remark about it it had taken on perceptibly the specialshade of consecration conferred by unanimities of silence theeffect she might have considered had been almost awkward thepromptitude of her separation from charlotte as if they had beendiscovered in some absurdity on her becoming aware ofspectators the spectators on the other hand that was theappearance mightn t have supposed them in the existingrelation addicted to mutual endearments and yet hesitatingwith a fine scruple between sympathy and hilarity must have feltthat almost any spoken or laughed comment could be kept fromsounding vulgar only by sounding beyond any permitted measure intelligent they had evidently looked the two young wives likea pair of women making up effusively as women were supposed todo especially when approved fools after a broil but takingnote of the reconciliation would imply on her father s part onamerigo s and on fanny assingham s some proportionate vision ofthe grounds of their difference there had been something therehad been but too much in the incident for each observer yetthere was nothing any one could have said without seemingessentially to say see see the dear things their quarrel sblissfully over our quarrel what quarrel the dear thingsthemselves would necessarily in that case have demanded andthe wits of the others would thus have been called upon for someagility of exercise no one had been equal to the flight ofproducing off hand a fictive reason for any estrangement totake that is the place of the true which had so long for thefiner sensibility pervaded the air and every one accordingly not to be inconveniently challenged was pretending immediatelyafter to have remarked nothing that any one else hadn t maggie s own measure had remained all the same full of thereflection caught from the total inference which had acted virtually by enabling every one present and oh charlotte notleast to draw a long breath the message of the little scenehad been different for each but it had been this markedly allround that it reinforced reinforced even immensely the generaleffort carried on from week to week and of late distinctly moresuccessful to look and talk and move as if nothing in life werethe matter supremely however while this glass was held up toher had maggie s sense turned to the quality of the successconstituted on the spot for charlotte most of all if she wasguessing how her father must have secretly started how herhusband must have secretly wondered how fanny assingham musthave secretly in a flash seen daylight for herself most of allhad she tasted by communication of the high profit involved forher companion she felt in all her pulses charlotte feel it and how publicity had been required absolutely to crown her ownabasement it was the added touch and now nothing was wanting which to do her stepmother justice mrs verver had appeared butto desire from that evening to show with the last vividness that she recognised maggie lived over again the minutes inquestion had found herself repeatedly doing so to the degreethat the whole evening hung together to her aftersense as athing appointed by some occult power that had dealt with her that had for instance animated the four with just the rightrestlessness too had decreed and directed and exactly timed itin them making their game of bridge however abysmal a face ithad worn for her give way precisely to their common unavowedimpulse to find out to emulate charlotte s impatience apreoccupation this latter attached detectedly to the member ofthe party who was roaming in her queerness and was for all theirsimulated blindness not roaming unnoted if mrs verver meanwhile then had struck her as determined in acertain direction by the last felicity into which that night hadflowered our young woman was yet not to fail of appreciating thetruth that she had not been put at ease after all with absolutepermanence maggie had seen her unmistakably desire to rise tothe occasion and be magnificent seen her decide that the rightway for this would be to prove that the reassurance she hadextorted there under the high cool lustre of the saloon atwinkle of crystal and silver had not only poured oil upon thetroubled waters of their question but had fairly drenched theirwhole intercourse with that lubricant she had exceeded the limitof discretion in this insistence on her capacity to repay inproportion a service she acknowledged as handsome whyhandsome maggie would have been free to ask since if she hadbeen veracious the service assuredly would not have been huge itwould in that case have come up vividly and for each of themalike that the truth on the princess s lips presented nodifficulty if the latter s mood in fact could have turneditself at all to private gaiety it might have failed to resistthe diversion of seeing so clever a creature so beguiled charlotte s theory of a generous manner was manifestly to expressthat her stepdaughter s word wiping out as she might have said everything had restored them to the serenity of a relationwithout a cloud it had been in short in this light ideallyconclusive so that no ghost of anything it referred to couldever walk again what was the ecstasy of that however but initself a trifle compromising as truly within the week maggiehad occasion to suspect her friend of beginning and ratherabruptly to remember convinced as she was of the examplealready given her by her husband and in relation to which herprofession of trust in his mistress had been an act of conformityexquisitely calculated her imagination yet sought in the hiddenplay of his influence the explanation of any change of surface any difference of expression or intention there had been through life as we know few quarters in which the princess sfancy could let itself loose but it shook off restraint when itplunged into the figured void of the detail of that relation this was a realm it could people with images again and againwith fresh ones they swarmed there like the strange combinationsthat lurked in the woods at twilight they loomed into thedefinite and faded into the vague their main present sign forher being however that they were always that they wereduskily agitated her earlier vision of a state of bliss madeinsecure by the very intensity of the bliss this had droppedfrom her she had ceased to see as she lost herself the pair ofoperatic of high wagnerian lovers she found deep within her these comparisons interlocked in their wood of enchantment agreen glade as romantic as one s dream of an old german forest the picture was veiled on the contrary with the dimness oftrouble behind which she felt indistinguishable the processionof forms that had lost all so pitifully their preciousconfidence therefore though there was in these days for her with amerigo little enough even of the imitation from day today of unembarrassed references as she had foreseen for thatmatter from the first that there would be her activeconception of his accessibility to their companion s own privateand unextinguished right to break ground was not much less activethan before so it was that her inner sense in spite ofeverything represented him as still pulling wires andcontrolling currents or rather indeed as muffling the wholepossibility keeping it down and down leading his accomplicecontinually on to some new turn of the road as regards herselfmaggie had become more conscious from week to week of hisingenuities of intention to make up to her for their forfeiture in so dire a degree of any reality of frankness a privationthat had left on his lips perhaps a little of the same thirstwith which she fairly felt her own distorted the torment of thelost pilgrim who listens in desert sands for the possible theimpossible plash of water it was just this hampered state inhim none the less that she kept before her when she wished mostto find grounds of dignity for the hard little passion whichnothing he had done could smother there were hours enough lonely hours in which she let dignity go then there were otherswhen clinging with her winged concentration to some deep cell ofher heart she stored away her hived tenderness as if she hadgathered it all from flowers he was walking ostensibly besideher but in fact given over without a break to the grey mediumin which he helplessly groped a perception on her part which wasa perpetual pang and which might last what it would for ever ifneed be but which if relieved at all must be relieved by hisact alone she herself could do nothing more for it she had donethe utmost possible it was meantime not the easier to bear forthis aspect under which charlotte was presented as depending onhim for guidance taking it from him even in doses of bitterness and yet lost with him in devious depths nothing was thus moresharply to be inferred than that he had promptly enough warnedher on hearing from her of the precious assurance received fromhis wife that she must take care her satisfaction didn t betraysomething of her danger maggie had a day of still waiting afterallowing him time to learn how unreservedly she had lied forhim of waiting as for the light of she scarce knew what slow shining reflection of this knowledge in his personal attitude what retarded evolution she asked herself in these hours mightn t poor charlotte all unwittingly have precipitated shewas thus poor charlotte again for maggie even while maggie s ownhead was bowed and the reason for this kept coming back to ouryoung woman in the conception of what would secretly have passed she saw her face to face with the prince take from him thechill of his stiffest admonition with the possibilities ofdeeper difficulty that it represented for each she heard herask irritated and sombre what tone in god s name since herbravery didn t suit him she was then to adopt and by way of afantastic flight of divination she heard amerigo reply in avoice of which every fine note familiar and admirable came hometo her that one must really manage such prudences a little forone s self it was positive in the princess that for this shebreathed charlotte s cold air turned away from him in it withher turned with her in growing compassion this way and that hovered behind her while she felt her ask herself where then sheshould rest marvellous the manner in which under suchimaginations maggie thus circled and lingered quite as if shewere materially following her unseen counting every step shehelplessly wasted noting every hindrance that brought her to apause a few days of this accordingly had wrought a change in thatapprehension of the instant beatitude of triumph of triumphmagnanimous and serene with which the upshot of the night sceneon the terrace had condemned our young woman to make terms shehad had as we know her vision of the gilt bars bent of thedoor of the cage forced open from within and the creatureimprisoned roaming at large a movement on the creature s part that was to have even for the short interval its impressivebeauty but of which the limit and in yet another direction hadloomed straight into view during her last talk under the greattrees with her father it was when she saw his wife s faceruefully attached to the quarter to which in the course of theirsession he had so significantly addressed his own it was thenthat maggie could watch for its turning pale it was then sheseemed to know what she had meant by thinking of her in sheshadow of his most ominous reference as doomed if as i say her attention now day after day so circled and hovered itfound itself arrested for certain passages during which sheabsolutely looked with charlotte s grave eyes what sheunfailingly made out through them was the figure of a littlequiet gentleman who mostly wore as he moved alone across thefield of vision a straw hat a white waistcoat and a bluenecktie keeping a cigar in his teeth and his hands in hispockets and who oftener than not presented a somewhatmeditative back while he slowly measured the perspectives of thepark and broodingly counted it might have appeared his steps there were hours of intensity for a week or two when it was forall the world as if she had guardedly tracked her stepmother inthe great house from room to room and from window to window only to see her here and there and everywhere try her uneasyoutlook question her issue and her fate something unmistakably had come up for her that had never come up before it represented a new complication and had begotten a newanxiety things these that she carried about with her done upin the napkin of her lover s accepted rebuke while she vainlyhunted for some corner where she might put them safely down thedisguised solemnity the prolonged futility of her search mighthave been grotesque to a more ironic eye but maggie s provisionof irony which we have taken for naturally small had never beenso scant as now and there were moments while she watched withher thus unseen when the mere effect of being near her was tofeel her own heart in her throat was to be almost moved tosaying to her hold on tight my poor dear without too muchterror and it will all come out somehow even to that indeed she could reflect charlotte might havereplied that it was easy to say even to that no great meaningcould attach so long as the little meditative man in the strawhat kept coming into view with his indescribable air of weavinghis spell weaving it off there by himself in whatever quarterof the horizon the appearances were scanned he was to be noticedas absorbed in this occupation and maggie was to become aware oftwo or three extraordinary occasions of receiving from him thehint that he measured the impression he produced it was notreally till after their recent long talk in the park that sheknew how deeply how quite exhaustively they had thencommunicated so that they were to remain together for the time in consequence quite in the form of a couple of sociabledrinkers who sit back from the table over which they have beenresting their elbows over which they have emptied to the lastdrop their respective charged cups the cups were still there onthe table but turned upside down and nothing was left for thecompanions but to confirm by placid silences the fact that thewine had been good they had parted positively as if on eitherside primed with it primed for whatever was to be andeverything between them as the month waned added its touch oftruth to this similitude nothing truly was at present betweenthem save that they were looking at each other in infinite trust it fairly wanted no more words and when they met during thedeep summer days met even without witnesses when they kissed atmorning and evening or on any of the other occasions of contactthat they had always so freely celebrated a pair of birds of theupper air could scarce have appeared less to invite each other tosit down and worry afresh so it was that in the house itself where more of his waiting treasures than ever were provisionallyranged she sometimes only looked at him from end to end of thegreat gallery the pride of the house for instance as if inone of the halls of a museum she had been an earnest young woman with a baedeker and he a vague gentleman to whom even baedekerswere unknown he had ever of course had his way of walkingabout to review his possessions and verify their condition butthis was a pastime to which he now struck her as almostextravagantly addicted and when she passed near him and heturned to give her a smile she caught or so she fancied thegreater depth of his small perpetual hum of contemplation itwas as if he were singing to himself sotto voce as he went andit was also on occasion quite ineffably as if charlotte hovering watching listening on her side too kept sufficientlywithin earshot to make it out as song and yet for some reasonconnected with the very manner of it stood off and didn t dare one of the attentions she had from immediately after her marriagemost freely paid him was that of her interest in his rarities her appreciation of his taste her native passion for beautifulobjects and her grateful desire not to miss anything he couldteach her about them maggie had in due course seen her beginto work this fortunately natural source of sympathy for all itwas worth she took possession of the mound throughout itsextent she abounded to odd excess one might have remarked inthe assumption of its being for her with her husband all theground the finest clearest air and most breathable mediumcommon to them it had been given to maggie to wonder if shedidn t in these intensities of approbation too much shut him upto his province but this was a complaint he had never made hisdaughter and charlotte must at least have had for her that thanks to her admirable instinct her range of perceptionmarching with his own and never falling behind she had probablynot so much as once treated him to a rasping mistake or arevealing stupidity maggie wonderfully in the summer days felt it forced upon her that that was one way after all ofbeing a genial wife and it was never so much forced upon her asat these odd moments of her encountering the sposi as amerigocalled them under the coved ceilings of fawns while sotogether yet at the same time so separate they were makingtheir daily round charlotte hung behind with emphasisedattention she stopped when her husband stopped but at thedistance of a case or two or of whatever other succession ofobjects and the likeness of their connection would not have beenwrongly figured if he had been thought of as holding in one ofhis pocketed hands the end of a long silken halter looped roundher beautiful neck he didn t twitch it yet it was there hedidn t drag her but she came and those indications that i havedescribed the princess as finding extraordinary in him were twoor three mute facial intimations which his wife s presence didn tprevent his addressing his daughter nor prevent his daughter asshe passed it was doubtless to be added from flushing a littleat the receipt of they amounted perhaps only to a wordless wordless smile but the smile was the soft shake of the twistedsilken rope and maggie s translation of it held in her breasttill she got well away came out only as if it might have beenoverheard when some door was closed behind her yes you see ilead her now by the neck i lead her to her doom and she doesn tso much as know what it is though she has a fear in her heartwhich if you had the chances to apply your ear there that i asa husband have you would hear thump and thump and thump shethinks it may be her doom the awful place over there awful forher but she s afraid to ask don t you see just as she s afraidof not asking just as she s afraid of so many other things thatshe sees multiplied round her now as portents and betrayals she ll know however when she does know charlotte s one opportunity meanwhile for the air of confidenceshe had formerly worn so well and that agreed so with her firmand charming type was the presence of visitors never as theseason advanced wholly intermitted rather in fact soconstant with all the people who turned up for luncheon and fortea and to see the house now replete now famous thatmaggie grew to think again of this large element of company asof a kind of renewed water supply for the tank in which like aparty of panting gold fish they kept afloat it helped them unmistakably with each other weakening the emphasis of so manyof the silences of which their intimate intercourse wouldotherwise have consisted beautiful and wonderful for her even at times was the effect of these interventions their effectabove all in bringing home to each the possible heroism ofperfunctory things they learned fairly to live in theperfunctory they remained in it as many hours of the day asmight be it took on finally the likeness of some spaciouscentral chamber in a haunted house a great overarched andoverglazed rotunda where gaiety might reign but the doors ofwhich opened into sinister circular passages here they turned upfor each other as they said with the blank faces that deniedany uneasiness felt in the approach here they closed numerousdoors carefully behind them all save the door that connected theplace as by a straight tented corridor with the outer world and encouraging thus the irruption of society imitated theaperture through which the bedizened performers of the circus arepoured into the ring the great part mrs verver had sociallyplayed came luckily maggie could make out to her assistance she had personal friends charlotte s personal friends had everbeen in london at the two houses one of the most convenientpleasantries who actually tempered at this crisis her aspectof isolation and it wouldn t have been hard to guess that herbest moments were those in which she suffered no fear of becominga bore to restrain her appeal to their curiosity their curiositymight be vague but their clever hostess was distinct and shemarched them about sparing them nothing as if she counted eachday on a harvest of half crowns maggie met her again in thegallery at the oddest hours with the party she wasentertaining heard her draw out the lesson insist upon theinterest snub even the particular presumption and smile forthe general bewilderment inevitable features these latter ofalmost any occasion in a manner that made our young woman herself incurably dazzled marvel afresh at the mystery by whicha creature who could be in some connexions so earnestly rightcould be in others so perversely wrong when her father vaguelycirculating was attended by his wife it was always charlottewho seemed to bring up the rear but he hung in the backgroundwhen she did cicerone and it was then perhaps that movingmildly and modestly to and fro on the skirts of the exhibition his appearance of weaving his spell was for the initiatedconscience least to be resisted brilliant women turned to himin vague emotion but his response scarce committed him more thanif he had been the person employed to see that after theinvading wave was spent the cabinets were all locked and thesymmetries all restored there was a morning when during the hour before luncheon andshortly after the arrival of a neighbourly contingent neighbourly from ten miles off whom mrs verver had taken incharge maggie paused on the threshold of the gallery throughwhich she had been about to pass faltered there for the veryimpression of his face as it met her from an opposite door charlotte half way down the vista held together as if bysomething almost austere in the grace of her authority thesemi scared now that they were there knot of her visitors who since they had announced themselves by telegram as yearningto inquire and admire saw themselves restricted to thisconsistency her voice high and clear and a little hard reachedher husband and her step daughter while she thus placed beyonddoubt her cheerful submission to duty her words addressed tothe largest publicity rang for some minutes through the place every one as quiet to listen as if it had been a church ablazewith tapers and she were taking her part in some hymn of praise fanny assingham looked rapt in devotion fanny assingham whoforsook this other friend as little as she forsook either herhost or the princess or the prince or the principino shesupported her in slow revolutions in murmurous attestations ofpresence at all such times and maggie advancing after a firsthesitation was not to fail of noting her solemn inscrutableattitude her eyes attentively lifted so that she might escapebeing provoked to betray an impression she betrayed one however as maggie approached dropping her gaze to the latter slevel long enough to seem to adventure marvellously on a muteappeal you understand don t you that if she didn t do thisthere would be no knowing what she might do this light mrs assingham richly launched while her younger friend unresistinglymoved became uncertain again and then not too much to showit or rather positively to conceal it and to concealsomething more as well turned short round to one of the windowsand awkwardly pointlessly waited the largest of the threepieces has the rare peculiarity that the garlands looped roundit which as you see are the finest possible vieux saxe arenot of the same origin or period or even wonderful as they are of a taste quite so perfect they have been put on at a latertime by a process of which there are very few examples and noneso important as this which is really quite unique so that though the whole thing is a little baroque its value as aspecimen is i believe almost inestimable so the high voice quavered aiming truly at effects far over theheads of gaping neighbours so the speaker piling it up sticking at nothing as less interested judges might have said seemed to justify the faith with which she was honoured maggiemeanwhile at the window knew the strangest thing to behappening she had turned suddenly to crying or was at least onthe point of it the lighted square before her all blurred anddim the high voice went on its quaver was doubtless forconscious ears only but there were verily thirty seconds duringwhich it sounded for our young woman like the shriek of a soulin pain kept up a minute longer it would break and collapse sothat maggie felt herself the next thing turn with a start toher father can t she be stopped hasn t she done it enough some such question as that she let herself ask him to suppose inher then it was that across half the gallery for he had notmoved from where she had first seen him he struck her asconfessing with strange tears in his own eyes to sharp identityof emotion poor thing poor thing it reached straight isn t she for one s credit on the swagger after which as held thus together they had still another strained minute theshame the pity the better knowledge the smothered protest thedivined anguish even so overcame him that blushing to his eyes he turned short away the affair but of a few muffled moments this snatched communion yet lifted maggie as on air so much fordeep guesses on her own side too it gave her to think of therewas honestly an awful mixture in things and it was not closedto her aftersense of such passages we have already indeed inother cases seen it open that the deepest depth of all in aperceived penalty was that you couldn t be sure some of yourcompunctions and contortions wouldn t show for ridiculous amerigo that morning for instance had been as absent as he atthis juncture appeared to desire he should mainly be noted asbeing he had gone to london for the day and the night anecessity that now frequently rose for him and that he had morethan once suffered to operate during the presence of guests successions of pretty women the theory of his fond interest inwhom had been publicly cultivated it had never occurred to hiswife to pronounce him ingenuous but there came at last a highdim august dawn when she couldn t sleep and when creepingrestlessly about and breathing at her window the coolness ofwooded acres she found the faint flush of the east march withthe perception of that other almost equal prodigy it rosilycoloured her vision that even such as he was yes her husbandcould on occasion sin by excess of candour he wouldn t otherwisehave given as his reason for going up to portland place in theaugust days that he was arranging books there he had bought agreat many of late and he had had others a large number sentfrom rome wonders of old print in which her father had beeninterested but when her imagination tracked him to the dustytown to the house where drawn blinds and pale shrouds where acaretaker and a kitchenmaid were alone in possession it wasn tto see him in his shirtsleeves unpacking battered boxes she saw him in truth less easily beguiled saw him wander inthe closed dusky rooms from place to place or else for longperiods recline on deep sofas and stare before him through thesmoke of ceaseless cigarettes she made him out as liking betterthan anything in the world just now to be alone with histhoughts being herself connected with his thoughts shecontinued to believe more than she had ever been it was therebya good deal as if he were alone with her she made him out asresting so from that constant strain of the perfunctory to whichhe was exposed at fawns and she was accessible to the impressionof the almost beggared aspect of this alternative it was likehis doing penance in sordid ways being sent to prison or beingkept without money it wouldn t have taken much to make her thinkof him as really kept without food he might have broken away might easily have started to travel he had a right thoughtwonderful maggie now to so many more freedoms than he took hissecret was of course that at fawns he all the while winced wasall the while in presences in respect to which he had thrownhimself back with a hard pressure on whatever mysteries ofpride whatever inward springs familiar to the man of the world he could keep from snapping maggie for some reason had thatmorning while she watched the sunrise taken an extraordinarymeasure of the ground on which he would have had to snatch atpretexts for absence it all came to her there he got off toescape from a sound the sound was in her own ears still that ofcharlotte s high coerced quaver before the cabinets in the hushedgallery the voice by which she herself had been pierced the daybefore as by that of a creature in anguish and by which whileshe sought refuge at the blurred window the tears had beenforced into her eyes her comprehension soared so high that thewonder for her became really his not feeling the need of widerintervals and thicker walls before that admiration she alsomeditated consider as she might now she kept reading not lessinto what he omitted than into what he performed a beauty ofintention that touched her fairly the more by being obscure itwas like hanging over a garden in the dark nothing was to bemade of the confusion of growing things but one felt they werefolded flowers and their vague sweetness made the whole airtheir medium he had to turn away but he wasn t at least acoward he would wait on the spot for the issue of what he haddone on the spot she sank to her knees with her arm on the ledgeof her window seat where she blinded her eyes from the fullglare of seeing that his idea could only be to wait whatevermight come at her side it was to her buried face that she thus for a long time felt him draw nearest though after a while when the strange wail of the gallery began to repeat itsinevitable echo she was conscious of how that brought out hispale hard grimace xxxixthe resemblance had not been present to her on first coming outinto the hot still brightness of the sunday afternoon only thesecond sunday of all the summer when the party of six theparty of seven including the principino had practically beenwithout accessions or invasions but within sight of charlotte seated far away very much where she had expected to find her the princess fell to wondering if her friend wouldn t be affectedquite as she herself had been that night on the terrace undermrs verver s perceptive pursuit the relation to day hadturned itself round charlotte was seeing her come throughpatches of lingering noon quite as she had watched charlottemenace her through the starless dark and there was a moment that of her waiting a little as they thus met across thedistance when the interval was bridged by a recognition not lesssoundless and to all appearance not less charged with strangemeanings than that of the other occasion the point however was that they had changed places maggie had from her window seen her stepmother leave the house at so unlikely an hour three o clock of a canicular august for a ramble in garden orgrove and had thereupon felt her impulse determined with thesame sharpness that had made the spring of her companion s threeweeks before it was the hottest day of the season and theshaded siesta for people all at their ease would certainlyrather have been prescribed but our young woman had perhaps notyet felt it so fully brought home that such refinements ofrepose among them constituted the empty chair at the feast this was the more distinct as the feast literally in the greatbedimmed dining room the cool ceremonious semblance ofluncheon had just been taking place without mrs verver she hadbeen represented but by the plea of a bad headache not reportedto the rest of the company by her husband but offered directlyto mr verver himself on their having assembled by her maid deputed for the effect and solemnly producing it maggie had sat down with the others to viands artfully iced tothe slow circulation of precious tinkling jugs to markedreserves of reference in many directions poor fanny assinghamherself scarce thrusting her nose out of the padded hollow intowhich she had withdrawn a consensus of languor which mightalmost have been taken for a community of dread ruled thescene relieved only by the fitful experiments of fathermitchell good holy hungry man a trusted and overworked londonfriend and adviser who had taken for a week or two the lightneighbouring service local rites flourishing under maggie smunificence and was enjoying as a convenience all the bountiesof the house he conversed undiscouraged father mitchell conversed mainly with the indefinite wandering smile of theentertainers and the princess s power to feel him on the whole ablessing for these occasions was not impaired by what was awkwardin her consciousness of having from the first of her trouble really found her way without his guidance she asked herself attimes if he suspected how more than subtly how perversely shehad dispensed with him and she balanced between visions of allhe must privately have guessed and certitudes that he had guessednothing whatever he might nevertheless have been so urbanelyfilling up gaps at present for the very reason that hisinstinct sharper than the expression of his face hadsufficiently served him made him aware of the thin ice figuratively speaking and of prolongations of tension roundabout him mostly foreign to the circles in which luxury was akinto virtue some day in some happier season she would confess tohim that she hadn t confessed though taking so much on herconscience but just now she was carrying in her weak stiffenedhand a glass filled to the brim as to which she had recorded avow that no drop should overflow she feared the very breath of abetter wisdom the jostle of the higher light of heavenly helpitself and in addition however that might be she drew breaththis afternoon as never yet in an element heavy to oppression something grave had happened somehow and somewhere and she had god knew her choice of suppositions her heart stood still whenshe wondered above all if the cord mightn t at last have snappedbetween her husband and her father she shut her eyes for dismayat the possibility of such a passage there moved before them theprocession of ugly forms it might have taken find out foryourself she had thrown to amerigo for her last word on thequestion of who else knew that night of the breaking of thebowl and she flattered herself that she hadn t since then helpedhim in her clear consistency by an inch it was what she hadgiven him all these weeks to be busy with and she had againand again lain awake for the obsession of this sense of hisuncertainty ruthlessly and endlessly playing with his dignity she had handed him over to an ignorance that couldn t even try tobecome indifferent and that yet wouldn t project itself either into the cleared air of conviction in proportion as he wasgenerous it had bitten into his spirit and more than once shehad said to herself that to break the spell she had cast upon himand that the polished old ivory of her father s inattackablesurface made so absolute he would suddenly commit some mistakeor some violence smash some windowpane for air fail even of oneof his blest inveteracies of taste in that way fatally hewould have put himself in the wrong blighting by a single falsestep the perfection of his outward show these shadows rose and fell for her while father mitchellprattled with other shadows as well those that hung overcharlotte herself those that marked her as a prey to equalsuspicions to the idea in particular of a change such achange as she didn t dare to face in the relations of the twomen or there were yet other possibilities as it seemed tomaggie there were always too many and all of them things ofevil when one s nerves had at last done for one all that nervescould do had left one in a darkness of prowling dangers that waslike the predicament of the night watcher in a beast haunted landwho has no more means for a fire she might with such nerves have supposed almost anything of any one anything almost ofpoor bob assingham condemned to eternal observances and solemnlyappreciating her father s wine anything verily yes of thegood priest as he finally sat back with fat folded hands andtwiddled his thumbs on his stomach the good priest looked hardat the decanters at the different dishes of dessert he eyedthem half obliquely as if they might have met him to day forconversation better than any one present but the princess hadher fancy at last about that too she was in the midst of apassage before she knew it between father mitchell andcharlotte some approach he would have attempted with her thatvery morning perhaps to the circumstance of an apparentdetachment recently noted in her from any practice of devotion he would have drawn from this say his artless inference takenit for a sign of some smothered inward trouble and pointed naturally the moral that the way out of such straits was notthrough neglect of the grand remedy he had possibly prescribedcontrition he had at any rate quickened in her the beat of thatfalse repose to which our young woman s own act had devoted herat her all so deluded instance the falsity of it had laid trapscompared to which the imputation of treachery even accepted mighthave seemed a path of roses the acceptance strangely wouldhave left her nothing to do she could have remained had sheliked all insolently passive whereas the failure to proceedagainst her as it might have been called left her everything and all the more that it was wrapped so in confidence she had toconfirm day after day the rightness of her cause and thejustice and felicity of her exemption so that wouldn t therehave been fairly in any explicit concern of father mitchell s depths of practical derision of her success the question was provisionally answered at all events by thetime the party at luncheon had begun to disperse with maggie sversion of mrs verver sharp to the point of representing herpretext for absence as a positive flight from derision she metthe good priest s eyes before they separated and priests werereally at the worst so to speak such wonderful people that shebelieved him for an instant on the verge of saying to her inabysmal softness go to mrs verver my child you go you llfind that you can help her this didn t come however nothingcame but the renewed twiddle of thumbs over the satisfied stomachand the full flush the comical candour of reference to the handemployed at fawns for mayonnaise of salmon nothing came but thereceding backs of each of the others her father s slightly bentshoulders in especial which seemed to weave his spell by theforce of habit not less patiently than if his wife had beenpresent her husband indeed was present to feel anything theremight be to feel which was perhaps exactly why this personagewas moved promptly to emulate so definite an example of sloping he had his occupations books to arrange perhaps evenat fawns the idea of the siesta moreover in all theconditions had no need to be loudly invoked maggie was in theevent left alone for a minute with mrs assingham who afterwaiting for safety appeared to have at heart to make ademonstration the stage of talking over had long passed forthem when they communicated now it was on quite ultimate facts but fanny desired to testify to the existence on her part of anattention that nothing escaped she was like the kind lady who happening to linger at the circus while the rest of thespectators pour grossly through the exits falls in with theoverworked little trapezist girl the acrobatic supportpresumably of embarrassed and exacting parents and gives her asan obscure and meritorious artist assurance of benevolentinterest what was clearest always in our young woman simaginings was the sense of being herself left for anyoccasion in the breach she was essentially there to bear theburden in the last resort of surrounding omissions andevasions and it was eminently to that office she had been to dayabandoned with this one alleviation as appeared of mrs assingham s keeping up with her mrs assingham suggested thatshe too was still on the ramparts though her gallantry provedindeed after a moment to consist not a little of her curiosity she had looked about and seen their companions beyond earshot don t you really want us to go maggie found a faint smile do you really want to it made her friend colour well then no but we would youknow at a look from you we d pack up and be off as asacrifice ah make no sacrifice said maggie see me through that s it that s all i want i should be too base besides fanny went on you re too splendid splendid splendid also you know you are all but through you ve doneit said mrs assingham but maggie only half took it from her what does it strike you that i ve done what you wanted they re going maggie continued to look at her is that what i wanted oh it wasn t for you to say that was his business my father s maggie asked after an hesitation your father s he has chosen and now she knows she sees it allbefore her and she can t speak or resist or move a littlefinger that s what s the matter with her said fanny assingham it made a picture somehow for the princess as they stoodthere the picture that the words of others whatever they mightbe always made for her even when her vision was alreadycharged better than any words of her own she saw round abouther through the chinks of the shutters the hard glare ofnature saw charlotte somewhere in it virtually at bay and yetdenied the last grace of any protecting truth she saw her offsomewhere all unaided pale in her silence and taking in herfate has she told you she then asked her companion smiled superior i don t need to be told either i see something thank god every day and then asmaggie might appear to be wondering what for instance i seethe long miles of ocean and the dreadful great country stateafter state which have never seemed to me so big or so terrible i see them at last day by day and step by step at the far end and i see them never come back but never simply i see theextraordinary interesting place which i ve never been to youknow and you have and the exact degree in which she will beexpected to be interested she will be maggie presently replied expected interested for a little after this their eyes met on it at the end ofwhich fanny said she ll be yes what she ll have to be and itwill be won t it for ever and ever she spoke as abounding inher friend s sense but it made maggie still only look at her these were large words and large visions all the more that now really they spread and spread in the midst of them however mrs assingham had soon enough continued when i talk of knowing indeed i don t mean it as you would have a right todo you know because you see and i don t see him i don t makehim out she almost crudely confessed maggie again hesitated you mean you don t make out amerigo but fanny shook her head and it was quite as if as an appeal toone s intelligence the making out of amerigo had in spite ofeverything long been superseded then maggie measured the reachof her allusion and how what she next said gave her meaning arichness no other name was to be spoken and mrs assingham hadtaken that without delay from her eyes with a discretion still that fell short but by an inch you know how he feels maggie at this then slowly matched her headshake i knownothing you know how you feel but again she denied it i know nothing if i did well if you did fanny asked as she faltered she had had enough however i should die she said as sheturned away she went to her room through the quiet house she roamed there amoment picking up pointlessly a different fan and then tookher way to the shaded apartments in which at this hour theprincipino would be enjoying his nap she passed through thefirst empty room the day nursery and paused at an open door the inner room large dim and cool was equally calm her boy sample antique historical royal crib consecrated reputedly by the guarded rest of heirs apparent and a gift early in hiscareer from his grandfather ruled the scene from the centre inthe stillness of which she could almost hear the child s softbreathing the prime protector of his dreams was installed besidehim her father sat there with as little motion with head thrownback and supported with eyes apparently closed with the finefoot that was so apt to betray nervousness at peace upon theother knee with the unfathomable heart folded in the constantflawless freshness of the white waistcoat that could alwaysreceive in its armholes the firm prehensile thumbs mrs noblehad majestically melted and the whole place signed her temporaryabdication yet the actual situation was regular and maggielingered but to look she looked over her fan the top of whichwas pressed against her face long enough to wonder if her fatherreally slept or if aware of her he only kept consciously quiet did his eyes truly fix her between lids partly open and was sheto take this his forebearance from any question only as a signagain that everything was left to her she at all events for aminute watched his immobility then as if once more renewingher total submission returned without a sound to her ownquarters a strange impulse was sharp in her but it was not for her part the desire to shift the weight she could as little have slept asshe could have slept that morning days before when she hadwatched the first dawn from her window turned to the east thisside of her room was now in shade with the two wings of thecasement folded back and the charm she always found in herseemingly perched position as if her outlook from above thehigh terraces was that of some castle tower mounted on a rock when she stood there she hung over over the gardens and thewoods all of which drowsed below her at this hour in theimmensity of light the miles of shade looked hot the banks offlowers looked dim the peacocks on the balustrades let theirtails hang limp and the smaller birds lurked among the leaves nothing therefore would have appeared to stir in the brilliantvoid if maggie at the moment she was about to turn away had notcaught sight of a moving spot a clear green sunshade in the actof descending a flight of steps it passed down from the terrace receding at a distance from sight and carried naturally soas to conceal the head and back of its bearer but maggie hadquickly recognised the white dress and the particular motion ofthis adventurer had taken in that charlotte of all people hadchosen the glare of noon for an exploration of the gardens andthat she could be betaking herself only to some unvisited quarterdeep in them or beyond them that she had already marked as asuperior refuge the princess kept her for a few minutes insight watched her long enough to feel her by the mere betrayalof her pace and direction driven in a kind of flight and thenunderstood for herself why the act of sitting still had becomeimpossible to either of them there came to her confusedly someecho of an ancient fable some vision of io goaded by the gadflyor of ariadne roaming the lone sea strand it brought with it allthe sense of her own intention and desire she too might havebeen for the hour some far off harassed heroine only with apart to play for which she knew exactly no inspiring precedent she knew but that all the while all the while of her sittingthere among the others without her she had wanted to go straightto this detached member of the party and make somehow for hersupport the last demonstration a pretext was all that wasneedful and maggie after another instant had found one she had caught a glimpse before mrs verver disappeared of hercarrying a book made out half lost in the folds of her whitedress the dark cover of a volume that was to explain her purposein case of her being met with surprise and the mate of which precisely now lay on maggie s table the book was an old novelthat the princess had a couple of days before mentioned havingbrought down from portland place in the charming original form ofits three volumes charlotte had hailed with a specious glitterof interest the opportunity to read it and our young woman had thereupon on the morrow directed her maid to carry it to mrs verver s apartments she was afterwards to observe that thismessenger unintelligent or inadvertent had removed but one ofthe volumes which happened not to be the first still possessed accordingly of the first while charlotte going out fantastically at such an hour to cultivate romance in anarbour was helplessly armed with the second maggie prepared onthe spot to sally forth with succour the right volume with aparasol was all she required in addition that is to thebravery of her general idea she passed again through the house unchallenged and emerged upon the terrace which she followed hugging the shade with that consciousness of turning the tableson her friend which we have already noted but so far as shewent after descending into the open and beginning to explore thegrounds mrs verver had gone still further with the increase ofthe oddity moreover of her having exchanged the protection ofher room for these exposed and shining spaces it was not fortunately however at last that by persisting in pursuit onedidn t arrive at regions of admirable shade this was the asylum presumably that the poor wandering woman had had in view several wide alleys in particular of great length denselyoverarched with the climbing rose and the honeysuckle andconverging in separate green vistas at a sort of umbrageoustemple an ancient rotunda pillared and statued niched androofed yet with its uncorrected antiquity like that ofeverything else at fawns conscious hitherto of no violence fromthe present and no menace from the future charlotte had pausedthere in her frenzy or what ever it was to be called the placewas a conceivable retreat and she was staring before her fromthe seat to which she appeared to have sunk all unwittingly asmaggie stopped at the beginning of one of the perspectives it was a repetition more than ever then of the evening on theterrace the distance was too great to assure her she had beenimmediately seen but the princess waited with her intention ascharlotte on the other occasion had waited allowing ohallowing for the difference of the intention maggie was full ofthe sense of that so full that it made her impatient whereuponshe moved forward a little placing herself in range of the eyesthat had been looking off elsewhere but that she had suddenlycalled to recognition charlotte had evidently not dreamed ofbeing followed and instinctively with her pale stare shestiffened herself for protest maggie could make that out aswell as further however that her second impression of herfriend s approach had an instant effect on her attitude theprincess came nearer gravely and in silence but fairly pausedagain to give her time for whatever she would whatever shewould whatever she could was what maggie wanted wanting aboveall to make it as easy for her as the case permitted that wasnot what charlotte had wanted the other night but this nevermattered the great thing was to allow her was fairly to producein her the sense of highly choosing at first clearly she hadbeen frightened she had not been pursued it had quickly struckher without some design on the part of her pursuer and whatmight she not be thinking of in addition but the way she had when herself the pursuer made her stepdaughter take in herspirit and her purpose it had sunk into maggie at the time thathard insistence and mrs verver had felt it and seen it andheard it sink which wonderful remembrance of pressuresuccessfully applied had naturally till now remained with her but her stare was like a projected fear that the buried treasure so dishonestly come by for which her companion s stillcountenance at the hour and afterwards had consented to serveas the deep soil might have worked up again to the surface tobe thrown back upon her hands yes it was positive that duringone of these minutes the princess had the vision of herparticular alarm it s her lie it s her lie that has mortallydisagreed with her she can keep down no longer her rebellion atit and she has come to retract it to disown it and denounceit to give me full in my face the truth instead this for aconcentrated instant maggie felt her helplessly gasp but onlyto let it bring home the indignity the pity of her state sheherself could but tentatively hover place in view the book shecarried look as little dangerous look as abjectly mild aspossible remind herself really of people she had read about instories of the wild west people who threw up their hands oncertain occasions as a sign they weren t carrying revolvers shecould almost have smiled at last troubled as she yet knewherself to show how richly she was harmless she held up hervolume which was so weak a weapon and while she continued forconsideration to keep her distance she explained with asquenched a quaver as possible i saw you come out saw you frommy window and couldn t bear to think you should find yourselfhere without the beginning of your book this is the beginning you ve got the wrong volume and i ve brought you out the right she remained after she had spoken it was like holding a parleywith a possible adversary and her intense her exalted littlesmile asked for formal leave may i come nearer now she seemedto say as to which however the next minute she sawcharlotte s reply lose itself in a strange process a thing ofseveral sharp stages which she could stand there and trace thedread after a minute had dropped from her face though discernibly enough she still couldn t believe in her having inso strange a fashion been deliberately made up to if she hadbeen made up to at least it was with an idea the idea that hadstruck her at first as necessarily dangerous that it wasn t insistently wasn t this shone from maggie with a force finallynot to be resisted and on that perception on the immense reliefso constituted everything had by the end of three minutesextraordinarily changed maggie had come out to her really because she knew her doomed doomed to a separation that was likea knife in her heart and in the very sight of heruncontrollable her blinded physical quest of a peace not to begrasped something of mrs assingham s picture of her as thrown for a grim future beyond the great sea and the great continenthad at first found fulfilment she had got away in thisfashion burning behind her almost the ships of disguise tolet her horror of what was before her play up without witnesses and even after maggie s approach had presented an innocent frontit was still not to be mistaken that she bristled with the signsof her extremity it was not to be said for them either thatthey were draped at this hour in any of her usual graces unveiled and all but unashamed they were tragic to the princessin spite of the dissimulation that with the return ofcomparative confidence was so promptly to operate how tragic in essence the very change made vivid the instant stiffening ofthe spring of pride this for possible defence if not forpossible aggression pride indeed the next moment had becomethe mantle caught up for protection and perversity she flung itround her as a denial of any loss of her freedom to be doomedwas in her situation to have extravagantly incurred a doom sothat to confess to wretchedness was by the same stroke toconfess to falsity she wouldn t confess she didn t a thousandtimes no she only cast about her and quite frankly andfiercely for something else that would give colour to her havingburst her bonds her eyes expanded her bosom heaved as sheinvoked it and the effect upon maggie was verily to wish shecould only help her to it she presently got up which seemed tomean oh stay if you like and when she had moved about awhileat random looking away looking at anything at everything buther visitor when she had spoken of the temperature and declaredthat she revelled in it when she had uttered her thanks for thebook which a little incoherently with her second volume sheperhaps found less clever than she expected when she had letmaggie approach sufficiently closer to lay untouched thetribute in question on a bench and take up obligingly itssuperfluous mate when she had done these things she sat down inanother place more or less visibly in possession of her part our young woman was to have passed in all her adventure nostranger moments for she not only now saw her companion fairlyagree to take her then for the poor little person she was findingit so easy to appear but fell in a secret responsive ecstasy to wondering if there were not some supreme abjection with whichshe might be inspired vague but increasingly brighter thispossibility glimmered on her it at last hung there adequatelyplain to charlotte that she had presented herself once more to as they said grovel and that truly made the stage large ithad absolutely within the time taken on the dazzling merit ofbeing large for each of them alike i m glad to see you alone there s something i ve been wantingto say to you i m tired said mrs verver i m tired tired it had dropped the next thing it couldn t all come atonce but maggie had already guessed what it was and the flushof recognition was in her face tired of this life the one we ve been leading you like it iknow but i ve dreamed another dream she held up her head now her lighted eyes more triumphantly rested she was finding shewas following her way maggie by the same influence sat insight of it there was something she was saving some quantity ofwhich she herself was judge and it was for a long moment evenwith the sacrifice the princess had come to make a good deallike watching her from the solid shore plunge into uncertain into possibly treacherous depths i see something else shewent on i ve an idea that greatly appeals to me i ve had itfor a long time it has come over me that we re wrong our reallife isn t here maggie held her breath ours my husband s and mine i m not speaking for you oh said maggie only praying not to be not even to appear stupid i m speaking for ourselves i m speaking charlotte broughtout for him i see for my father for your father for whom else they looked at each other hardnow but maggie s face took refuge in the intensity of herinterest she was not at all even so stupid as to treat hercompanion s question as requiring an answer a discretion thather controlled stillness had after an instant justified imust risk your thinking me selfish for of course you know whatit involves let me admit it i am selfish i place my husbandfirst well said maggie smiling and smiling since that s where iplace mine you mean you ll have no quarrel with me so much the betterthen for charlotte went on with a higher and higher flight my plan is completely formed maggie waited her glimmer had deepened her chance somehow wasat hand the only danger was her spoiling it she felt herselfskirting an abyss what then may i ask is your plan it hung fire but ten seconds it came out sharp to take himhome to his real position and not to wait do you mean a this season i mean immediately and i may as well tell you now i mean formy own time i want charlotte said to have him at last alittle to myself i want strange as it may seem to you and shegave it all its weight to keep the man i ve married and to doso i see i must act maggie with the effort still to follow the right line feltherself colour to the eyes immediately she thoughtfullyechoed as soon as we can get off the removal of everything is afterall but a detail that can always be done with money as hespends it everything can what i ask for charlotte declared is the definite break and i wish it now with which her head like her voice rose higher oh she added i know mydifficulty far down below the level of attention in she could scarce havesaid what sacred depths maggie s inspiration had come and ithad trembled the next moment into sound do you mean i m yourdifficulty you and he together since it s always with you that i ve had tosee him but it s a difficulty that i m facing if you wish toknow that i ve already faced that i propose to myself tosurmount the struggle with it none too pleasant hasn t beenfor me as you may imagine in itself charming i ve felt in itat times if i must tell you all too great and too strange anugliness yet i believe it may succeed she had risen with this mrs verver and had moved for theemphasis of it a few steps away while maggie motionless atfirst but sat and looked at her you want to take my fatherfrom me the sharp successful almost primitive wail in it made charlotteturn and this movement attested for the princess the felicity ofher deceit something in her throbbed as it had throbbed thenight she stood in the drawing room and denied that she hadsuffered she was ready to lie again if her companion would butgive her the opening then she should know she had done all charlotte looked at her hard as if to compare her face with hernote of resentment and maggie feeling this met it with thesigns of an impression that might pass for the impression ofdefeat i want really to possess him said mrs verver ihappen also to feel that he s worth it maggie rose as if to receive her oh worth it she wonderfullythrew off the tone she instantly saw again had its effect charlotteflamed aloft might truly have been believing in her passionateparade you ve thought you ve known what he s worth indeed then my dear i believe i have as i believe i stilldo she had given it maggie straight back and again it had notmissed charlotte for another moment only looked at her thenbroke into the words maggie had known they would come of whichshe had pressed the spring how i see that you loathed ourmarriage do you ask me maggie after an instant demanded charlotte had looked about her picked up the parasol she hadlaid on a bench possessed herself mechanically of one of thevolumes of the relegated novel and then more consciously flungit down again she was in presence visibly of her last word she opened her sunshade with a click she twirled it on hershoulder in her pride ask you do i need how i see shebroke out that you ve worked against me oh oh oh the princess exclaimed her companion leaving her had reached one of the archways buton this turned round with a flare you haven t worked againstme maggie took it and for a moment kept it held it with closedeyes as if it had been some captured fluttering bird pressed byboth hands to her breast then she opened her eyes to speak what does it matter if i ve failed you recognise then that you ve failed asked charlotte from thethreshold maggie waited she looked as her companion had done a momentbefore at the two books on the seat she put them together andlaid them down then she made up her mind i ve failed shesounded out before charlotte having given her time walked away she watched her splendid and erect float down the long vista then she sank upon a seat yes she had done all part sixth xl i ll do anything you like she said to her husband on one ofthe last days of the month if our being here this way at thistime seems to you too absurd or too uncomfortable or tooimpossible we ll either take leave of them now withoutwaiting or we ll come back in time three days before theystart i ll go abroad with you if you but say the word toswitzerland the tyrol the italian alps to whichever of yourold high places you would like most to see again those beautifulones that used to do you good after rome and that you so oftentold me about where they were in the conditions that prompted this offer andwhere it might indeed appear ridiculous that with the stalelondon september close at hand they should content themselveswith remaining was where the desert of portland place lookedblank as it had never looked and where a drowsy cabman scanningthe horizon for a fare could sink to oblivion of the risks ofimmobility but amerigo was of the odd opinion day after day that their situation couldn t be bettered and he even went at nomoment through the form of replying that should their ordealstrike her as exceeding their patience any step they might takewould be for her own relief this was no doubt partly becausehe stood out so wonderfully to the end against admitting by aweak word at least that any element of their existence was orever had been an ordeal no trap of circumstance no lapse of form no accident of irritation had landed him in thatinconsequence his wife might verily have suggested that he wasconsequent consequent with the admirable appearance he had fromthe first so undertaken and so continued to present rather toorigidly at her expense only as it happened she was not thelittle person to do anything of the sort and the strange tacitcompact actually in operation between them might have beenfounded on an intelligent comparison a definite collationpositively of the kinds of patience proper to each she wasseeing him through he had engaged to come out at the right endif she would see him this understanding tacitly renewed fromweek to week had fairly received with the procession of theweeks the consecration of time but it scarce needed to beinsisted on that she was seeing him on his terms not all onhers or that in other words she must allow him his unexplainedand uncharted his one practicably workable way if that way byone of the intimate felicities the liability to which was so farfrom having even yet completely fallen from him happenedhandsomely to show him as more bored than boring with advantagesof his own freely to surrender but none to be persuadedlyindebted to others for what did such a false face of the matterrepresent but the fact itself that she was pledged if she hadquestioned or challenged or interfered if she had reservedherself that right she wouldn t have been pledged whereas therewere still and evidently would be yet a while long tensestretches during which their case might have been hanging forevery eye on her possible her impossible defection she mustkeep it up to the last mustn t absent herself for three minutesfrom her post only on those lines assuredly would she showherself as with him and not against him it was extraordinary how scant a series of signs she had invitedhim to make of being of truly having been at any time with his wife that reflection she was not exempt from as they now intheir suspense supremely waited a reflection under the brush ofwhich she recognised her having had in respect to him as well to do all to go the whole way over to move indefatigably while he stood as fixed in his place as some statue of one of hisforefathers the meaning of it would seem to be she reasoned insequestered hours that he had a place and that this was anattribute somehow indefeasible unquenchable which laid uponothers from the moment they definitely wanted anything of him the necessity of taking more of the steps that he could ofcircling round him of remembering for his benefit the famousrelation of the mountain to mahomet it was strange if one hadgone into it but such a place as amerigo s was like somethingmade for him beforehand by innumerable facts facts largely ofthe sort known as historical made by ancestors examples traditions habits while maggie s own had come to show simply asthat improvised post a post of the kind spoken of asadvanced with which she was to have found herself connected inthe fashion of a settler or a trader in a new country in thelikeness even of some indian squaw with a papoose on her back andbarbarous bead work to sell maggie s own in short would havebeen sought in vain in the most rudimentary map of the socialrelations as such the only geography marking it would bedoubtless that of the fundamental passions the end that theprince was at all events holding out for was represented toexpectation by his father in law s announced departure foramerica with mrs verver just as that prospective event hadoriginally figured as advising for discretion the flight of theyounger couple to say nothing of the withdrawal of whateverother importunate company before the great upheaval of fawns this residence was to be peopled for a month by porters packersand hammerers at whose operations it had become peculiarlypublic public that is for portland place that charlotte was topreside in force operations the quite awful appointed scale andstyle of which had at no moment loomed so large to maggie s mindas one day when the dear assinghams swam back into her kenbesprinkled with sawdust and looking as pale as if they had seensamson pull down the temple they had seen at least what she wasnot seeing rich dim things under the impression of which theyhad retired she having eyes at present but for the clock bywhich she timed her husband or for the glass the image perhapswould be truer in which he was reflected to her as he timed thepair in the country the accession of their friends from cadoganplace contributed to all their intermissions at any rate acertain effect of resonance an effect especially marked by theupshot of a prompt exchange of inquiries between mrs assinghamand the princess it was noted on the occasion of that anxiouslady s last approach to her young friend at fawns that hersympathy had ventured after much accepted privation again tobecome inquisitive and it had perhaps never so yielded to thatneed as on this question of the present odd line of thedistinguished eccentrics you mean to say really that you re going to stick here andthen before maggie could answer what on earth will you do withyour evenings maggie waited a moment maggie could still tentatively smile when people learn we re here and of course the papers will befull of it they ll flock back in their hundreds from whereverthey are to catch us you see you and the colonel haveyourselves done it as for our evenings they won t i dare say be particularly different from anything else that s ours theywon t be different from our mornings or our afternoons exceptperhaps that you two dears will sometimes help us to get throughthem i ve offered to go anywhere she added to take a houseif he will but this just this and nothing else is amerigo sidea he gave it yesterday she went on a name that as hesaid described and fitted it so you see and the princessindulged again in her smile that didn t play but that only asmight have been said worked so you see there s a method in ourmadness it drew mrs assingham s wonder and what then is the name the reduction to its simplest expression of what we aredoing that s what he called it therefore as we re doingnothing we re doing it in the most aggravated way which is theway he desires with which maggie further said of course iunderstand so do i her visitor after a moment breathed you ve had tovacate the house that was inevitable but at least here hedoesn t funk our young woman accepted the expression he doesn t funk it only however half contented fanny who thoughtfully raisedher eyebrows he s prodigious but what is there as you ve fixed it to dodge unless she pursued it s her gettingnear him it s if you ll pardon my vulgarity her getting athim that she suggested may count with him but it found the princess prepared she can get near him here she can get at him she can come up can she fanny assingham questioned can t she maggie returned their eyes for a minute intimately met on it after which theelder woman said i mean for seeing him alone so do i said the princess at which fanny for her reasons couldn t help smiling oh ifit s for that he s staying he s staying i ve made it out to take anything that comes orcalls upon him to take maggie went on even that then sheput it as she had at last put it to herself he s staying forhigh decency decency mrs assingham gravely echoed decency if she should try well mrs assingham urged well i hope hope he ll see her maggie hesitated however she made no direct reply it suseless hoping she presently said she won t but he oughtto her friend s expression of a moment before which had beenapologised for as vulgar prolonged its sharpness to her ear that of an electric bell under continued pressure stated sosimply what was it but dreadful truly that the feasibility ofcharlotte s getting at the man who for so long had loved hershould now be in question strangest of all things doubtless this care of maggie s as to what might make for it or makeagainst it stranger still her fairly lapsing at moments into avague calculation of the conceivability on her own part withher husband of some direct sounding of the subject would it betoo monstrous her suddenly breaking out to him as in alarm atthe lapse of the weeks wouldn t it really seem that you rebound in honour to do something for her privately before theygo maggie was capable of weighing the risk of this adventurefor her own spirit capable of sinking to intense littleabsences even while conversing as now with the person who hadmost of her confidence during which she followed up thepossibilities it was true that mrs assingham could at suchtimes somewhat restore the balance by not wholly failing toguess her thought her thought however just at present hadmore than one face had a series that it successively presented these were indeed the possibilities involved in the adventure ofher concerning herself for the quantity of compensation that mrs verver might still look to there was always the possibility thatshe was after all sufficiently to get at him there was in factthat of her having again and again done so against this stoodnothing but fanny assingham s apparent belief in her privation more mercilessly imposed or more hopelessly felt in the actualrelation of the parties over and beyond everything that frommore than three months back of course had fostered in theprincess a like conviction these assumptions might certainly bebaseless inasmuch as there were hours and hours of amerigo stime that there was no habit no pretence of his accounting for inasmuch too as charlotte inevitably had had more than once tothe undisguised knowledge of the pair in portland place beenobliged to come up to eaton square whence so many of herpersonal possessions were in course of removal she didn t cometo portland place didn t even come to ask for luncheon on twoseparate occasions when it reached the consciousness of thehousehold there that she was spending the day in london maggiehated she scorned to compare hours and appearances to weighthe idea of whether there hadn t been moments during these days when an assignation in easy conditions a snatched interview inan air the season had so cleared of prying eyes mightn tperfectly work but the very reason of this was partly that haunted with the vision of the poor woman carrying off with suchbravery as she found to her hand the secret of her not beingappeased she was conscious of scant room for any alternativeimage the alternative image would have been that the secretcovered up was the secret of appeasement somehow obtained somehow extorted and cherished and the difference between thetwo kinds of hiding was too great to permit of a mistake charlotte was hiding neither pride nor joy she was hidinghumiliation and here it was that the princess s passion sopowerless for vindictive flights most inveterately bruised itstenderness against the hard glass of her question behind the glass lurked the whole history of the relation she hadso fairly flattened her nose against it to penetrate the glassmrs verver might at this stage have been frantically tapping from within by way of supreme irrepressible entreaty maggiehad said to herself complacently after that last passage withher stepmother in the garden of fawns that there was nothingleft for her to do and that she could thereupon fold her hands but why wasn t it still left to push further and from the pointof view of personal pride grovel lower why wasn t it stillleft to offer herself as the bearer of a message reporting to himtheir friend s anguish and convincing him of her need she could thus have translated mrs verver s tap against theglass as i have called it into fifty forms could perhaps havetranslated it most into the form of a reminder that would piercedeep you don t know what it is to have been loved and brokenwith you haven t been broken with because in your relation whatcan there have been worth speaking of to break ours waseverything a relation could be filled to the brim with the wineof consciousness and if it was to have no meaning no bettermeaning than that such a creature as you could breathe upon it at your hour for blight why was i myself dealt with all fordeception why condemned after a couple of short years to findthe golden flame oh the golden flame a mere handful of blackashes our young woman so yielded at moments to what wasinsidious in these foredoomed ingenuities of her pity that forminutes together sometimes the weight of a new duty seemed torest upon her the duty of speaking before separation shouldconstitute its chasm of pleading for some benefit that might becarried away into exile like the last saved object of price ofthe emigre the jewel wrapped in a piece of old silk andnegotiable some day in the market of misery this imagined service to the woman who could no longer helpherself was one of the traps set for maggie s spirit at everyturn of the road the click of which catching and holding thedivine faculty fast was followed inevitably by a flutter by astruggle of wings and even as we may say by a scattering offine feathers for they promptly enough felt these yearnings ofthought and excursions of sympathy the concussion that couldn tbring them down the arrest produced by the so remarkablydistinct figure that at fawns for the previous weeks wasconstantly crossing in its regular revolution the further endof any watched perspective whoever knew or whoever didn t whether or to what extent charlotte with natural business ineaton square had shuffled other opportunities under that cloak it was all matter for the kind of quiet ponderation the littleman who so kept his wandering way had made his own it was partof the very inveteracy of his straw hat and his white waistcoat of the trick of his hands in his pockets of the detachment ofthe attention he fixed on his slow steps from behind his securepince nez the thing that never failed now as an item in thepicture was that gleam of the silken noose his wife s immaterialtether so marked to maggie s sense during her last month in thecountry mrs verver s straight neck had certainly not slippedit nor had the other end of the long cord oh quiteconveniently long disengaged its smaller loop from the hookedthumb that with his fingers closed upon it her husband kept outof sight to have recognised for all its tenuity the play ofthis gathered lasso might inevitably be to wonder with what magicit was twisted to what tension subjected but could never be todoubt either of its adequacy to its office or of its perfectdurability these reminded states for the princess were in factstates of renewed gaping so many things her father knew that sheeven yet didn t all this at present with mrs assingham passed through her inquick vibrations she had expressed while the revolution of herthought was incomplete the idea of what amerigo ought on hisside in the premises to be capable of and then had felt hercompanion s answering stare but she insisted on what she hadmeant he ought to wish to see her and i mean in some protectedand independent way as he used to in case of her being herselfable to manage it that said maggie with the courage of herconviction he ought to be ready he ought to be happy he oughtto feel himself sworn little as it is for the end of such ahistory to take from her it s as if he wished to get offwithout taking anything mrs assingham deferentially mused but for what purpose is ityour idea that they should again so intimately meet for any purpose they like that s their affair fanny assingham sharply laughed then irrepressibly fell back toher constant position you re splendid perfectly splendid towhich as the princess shaking an impatient head wouldn t haveit again at all she subjoined or if you re not it s becauseyou re so sure i mean sure of him ah i m exactly not sure of him if i were sure of him ishouldn t doubt but maggie cast about her doubt what fanny pressed as she waited well that he must feel how much less than she he pays and howthat ought to keep her present to him this in its turn after an instant mrs assingham could meetwith a smile trust him my dear to keep her present but trusthim also to keep himself absent leave him his own way i ll leave him everything said maggie only you know it s mynature i think it s your nature to think too much fanny assingham a triflecoarsely risked this but quickened however in the princess the act shereprobated that may be but if i hadn t thought you wouldn t you mean have been where you are yes because they on their side thought of everything butthat they thought of everything but that i might think or even her friend too superficially concurred that yourfather might as to this at all events maggie discriminated no thatwouldn t have prevented them for they knew that his first carewould be not to make me do so as it is maggie added that hashad to become his last fanny assingham took it in deeper for what it immediately madeher give out louder he s splendid then she sounded it almostaggressively it was what she was reduced to she had positivelyto place it ah that as much as you please maggie said this and left it but the tone of it had the nextmoment determined in her friend a fresh reaction you think both of you so abysmally and yet so quietly but it s what willhave saved you oh maggie returned it s what from the moment theydiscovered we could think at all will have saved them forthey re the ones who are saved she went on we re the ones whoare lost lost lost to each other father and i and then as her friendappeared to demur oh yes maggie quite lucidly declared lostto each other much more really than amerigo and charlotte are since for them it s just it s right it s deserved while for usit s only sad and strange and not caused by our fault but idon t know she went on why i talk about myself for it s onfather it really comes i let him go said maggie you let him but you don t make him i take it from him she answered but what else can you do i take it from him the princess repeated i do what i knewfrom the first i should do i get off by giving him up but if he gives you mrs assingham presumed to object doesn t it moreover then she asked complete the very purposewith which he married that of making you and leaving you morefree maggie looked at her long yes i help him to do that mrs assingham hesitated but at last her bravery flared whynot call it then frankly his complete success well said maggie that s all that s left me to do it s a success her friend ingeniously developed with whichyou ve simply not interfered and as if to show that she spokewithout levity mrs assingham went further he has made it asuccess for them ah there you are maggie responsively mused yes she saidthe next moment that s why amerigo stays let alone it s why charlotte goes that mrs assingham andemboldened smiled so he knows but maggie hung back amerigo after which however sheblushed to her companion s recognition your father he knows what you know i mean fanny faltered well how much does he know maggie s silence and maggie s eyeshad in fact arrested the push of the question which for adecent consistency she couldn t yet quite abandon what ishould rather say is does he know how much she found it stillawkward how much i mean they did how far she touched itup they went maggie had waited but only with a question do you think hedoes know at least something oh about him i can t think he sbeyond me said fanny assingham then do you yourself know how much how much how far how far fanny had appeared to wish to make sure but there was somethingshe remembered remembered in time and even with a smile i vetold you before that i know absolutely nothing well that s what i know said the princess her friend again hesitated then nobody knows i mean mrs assingham explained how much your father does oh maggie showed that she understood nobody not a little charlotte a little the princess echoed to know anything would be forher to know enough and she doesn t know anything if she did maggie answered amerigo would and that s just it that he doesn t that s just it said the princess profoundly on which mrs assingham reflected then how is charlotte soheld just by that by her ignorance by her ignorance fanny wondered a torment a torment said maggie with tears in her eyes her companion a moment watched them but the prince then how is he held maggie asked how is he held oh i can t tell you that and the princess again broke off xlia telegram in charlotte s name arrived early we shall comeand ask you for tea at five if convenient to you am wiring forthe assinghams to lunch this document into which meanings wereto be read maggie promptly placed before her husband adding theremark that her father and his wife who would have come up theprevious night or that morning had evidently gone to an hotel the prince was in his own room where he often sat now alone half a dozen open newspapers the figaro notably as well asthe times were scattered about him but with a cigar in histeeth and a visible cloud on his brow he appeared actually to beengaged in walking to and fro never yet on thus approachinghim for she had done it of late under one necessity or another several times had a particular impression so greeted her supremely strong for some reason as he turned quickly round onher entrance the reason was partly the look in his face asuffusion like the flush of fever which brought back to herfanny assingham s charge recently uttered under that roof ofher thinking too impenetrably the word had remained with herand made her think still more so that at first as she stoodthere she felt responsible for provoking on his part anirritation of suspense at which she had not aimed she had beengoing about him these three months she perfectly knew with amaintained idea of which she had never spoken to him but whathad at last happened was that his way of looking at her onoccasion seemed a perception of the presence not of one idea but of fifty variously prepared for uses with which he somehowmust reckon she knew herself suddenly almost strangely glad tobe coming to him at this hour with nothing more abstract than atelegram but even after she had stepped into his prison underher pretext while her eyes took in his face and then embracedthe four walls that enclosed his restlessness she recognised thevirtual identity of his condition with that aspect of charlotte ssituation for which early in the summer and in all the amplitudeof a great residence she had found with so little seeking thesimilitude of the locked cage he struck her as caged the manwho couldn t now without an instant effect on her sensibilitygive an instinctive push to the door she had not completelyclosed behind her he had been turning twenty ways forimpatiences all his own and when she was once shut in with himit was yet again as if she had come to him in his more thanmonastic cell to offer him light or food there was a differencenone the less between his captivity and charlotte s thedifference as it might be of his lurking there by his own actand his own choice the admission of which had indeed virtuallybeen in his starting on her entrance as if even this were inits degree an interference that was what betrayed for her practically his fear of her fifty ideas and what had begun after a minute to make her wish to repudiate or explain it wasmore wonderful than she could have told it was for all the worldas if she was succeeding with him beyond her intention she had for these instants the sense that he exaggerated that theimputation of purpose had fairly risen too high in him she hadbegun a year ago by asking herself how she could make him thinkmore of her but what was it after all he was thinking now hekept his eyes on her telegram he read it more than once easy asit was in spite of its conveyed deprecation to understand during which she found herself almost awestruck with yearning almost on the point of marking somehow what she had marked in thegarden at fawns with charlotte that she had truly come unarmed she didn t bristle with intentions she scarce knew as he atthis juncture affected her what had become of the only intentionshe had come with she had nothing but her old idea the old onehe knew she hadn t the ghost of another presently in fact whenfour or five minutes had elapsed it was as if she positively hadn t so much even as that one he gave her back her paper asking with it if there were anything in particular she wishedhim to do she stood there with her eyes on him doubling the telegramtogether as if it had been a precious thing and yet all the whileholding her breath of a sudden somehow and quite as by theaction of their merely having between them these few writtenwords an extraordinary fact came up he was with her as if hewere hers hers in a degree and on a scale with an intensity andan intimacy that were a new and a strange quantity that werelike the irruption of a tide loosening them where they had stuckand making them feel they floated what was it that with therush of this just kept her from putting out her hands to him from catching at him as in the other time with the superficialimpetus he and charlotte had privately conspired to impart shehad so often her breath failing her known the impulse to catchat her father she did however just yet nothing inconsequent though she couldn t immediately have said what saved her and bythe time she had neatly folded her telegram she was doingsomething merely needful i wanted you simply to know so thatyou mayn t by accident miss them for it s the last saidmaggie the last i take it as their good bye and she smiled as she could alwayssmile they come in state to take formal leave they doeverything that s proper tomorrow she said they go tosouthampton if they do everything that s proper the prince presentlyasked why don t they at least come to dine she hesitated yet she lightly enough provided her answer thatwe must certainly ask them it will be easy for you but ofcourse they re immensely taken he wondered so immensely taken that they can t that yourfather can t give you his last evening in england this for maggie was more difficult to meet yet she was stillnot without her stop gap that may be what they ll propose thatwe shall go somewhere together the four of us for acelebration except that to round it thoroughly off we oughtalso to have fanny and the colonel they don t want them at tea she quite sufficiently expresses they polish them off poordears they get rid of them beforehand they want only ustogether and if they cut us down to tea she continued asthey cut fanny and the colonel down to luncheon perhaps it s forthe fancy after all of their keeping their last night in londonfor each other she said these things as they came to her she was unable to keepthem back even though as she heard herself she might have beenthrowing everything to the winds but wasn t that the right way for sharing his last day of captivity with the man one adored itwas every moment more and more for her as if she were waitingwith him in his prison waiting with some gleam of remembrance ofhow noble captives in the french revolution the darkness of theterror used to make a feast or a high discourse of their lastpoor resources if she had broken with everything now everyobservance of all the past months she must simply then take itso take it that what she had worked for was too near at last to let her keep her head she might have been losing her headverily in her husband s eyes since he didn t know all thewhile that the sudden freedom of her words was but the divertedintensity of her disposition personally to seize him he didn tknow either that this was her manner now she was with him ofbeguiling audaciously the supremacy of suspense for the peopleof the french revolution assuredly there wasn t suspense thescaffold for those she was thinking of was certain whereaswhat charlotte s telegram announced was short of someincalculable error clear liberation just the point however was in its being clearer to herself than to him her clearnesses clearances those she had so all but abjectly laboured for threatened to crowd upon her in the form of one of the clustersof angelic heads the peopled shafts of light beating downthrough iron bars that regale on occasion precisely thefevered vision of those who are in chains she was going to know she felt later on was going to know with compunction doubtless on the very morrow how thumpingly her heart hadbeaten at this foretaste of their being left together she shouldjudge at leisure the surrender she was making to theconsciousness of complications about to be bodily lifted sheshould judge at leisure even that avidity for an issue which wasmaking so little of any complication but the unextinguishedpresence of the others and indeed that she was alreadysimplifying so much more than her husband came out for her nextin the face with which he listened he might certainly well bepuzzled in respect to his father in law and mrs verver by herglance at their possible preference for a concentrated evening but it isn t is it he asked as if they were leaving eachother oh no it isn t as if they were leaving each other they re onlybringing to a close without knowing when it may open again atime that has been naturally awfully interesting to them yes she could talk so of their time she was somehow sustained shewas sustained even to affirm more intensely her presentpossession of her ground they have their reasons many thingsto think of how can one tell but there s always also thechance of his proposing to me that we shall have our last hourstogether i mean that he and i shall he may wish to take me offto dine with him somewhere alone and to do it in memory of olddays i mean the princess went on the real old days beforemy grand husband was invented and much more before his grandwife was the wonderful times of his first great interest in whathe has since done his first great plans and opportunities discoveries and bargains the way we ve sat together late everso late in foreign restaurants which he used to like the waythat in every city in europe we ve stayed on and on with ourelbows on the table and most of the lights put out to talk overthings he had that day seen or heard of or made his offer for the things he had secured or refused or lost there were placeshe took me to you wouldn t believe for often he could onlyhave left me with servants if he should carry me off with himto night for old sake s sake to the earl s court exhibition itwill be a little just a very very little like our youngadventures after which while amerigo watched her and in factquite because of it she had an inspiration to which shepresently yielded if he was wondering what she would say nextshe had found exactly the thing in that case he will leave youcharlotte to take care of in our absence you ll have to carryher off somewhere for your last evening unless you may prefer tospend it with her here i shall then see that you dine that youhave everything quite beautifully you ll be able to do as youlike she couldn t have been sure beforehand and had really not been but the most immediate result of this speech was his letting hersee that he took it for no cheap extravagance either of irony orof oblivion nothing in the world of a truth had ever been sosweet to her as his look of trying to be serious enough to makeno mistake about it she troubled him which hadn t been at allher purpose she mystified him which she couldn t help and comparatively didn t mind then it came over her that he had after all a simplicity very considerable on which she hadnever dared to presume it was a discovery not like the otherdiscovery she had once made but giving out a freshness and sherecognised again in the light of it the number of the ideas ofwhich he thought her capable they were all apparently queerfor him but she had at least with the lapse of the months created the perception that there might be something in them whereby he stared there beautiful and sombre at what she was atpresent providing him with there was something of his own in hismind to which she was sure he referred everything for ameasure and a meaning he had never let go of it from theevening weeks before when in her room after his encounterwith the bloomsbury cup she had planted it there by flinging itat him on the question of her father s view of him herdetermined find out for yourself she had been aware duringthe months that he had been trying to find out and had beenseeking above all to avoid the appearance of any evasions ofsuch a form of knowledge as might reach him with violence orwith a penetration more insidious from any other source nothing however had reached him nothing he could at allconveniently reckon with had disengaged itself for him even fromthe announcement sufficiently sudden of the final secession oftheir companions charlotte was in pain charlotte was intorment but he himself had given her reason enough for that and in respect to the rest of the whole matter of her obligationto follow her husband that personage and she maggie had soshuffled away every link between consequence and cause that theintention remained like some famous poetic line in a deadlanguage subject to varieties of interpretation what renewedthe obscurity was her strange image of their common offer to him her father s and her own of an opportunity to separate from mrs verver with the due amount of form and all the more that he was in so pathetic a way unable to treat himself to a quarrel withit on the score of taste taste in him as a touchstone was nowall at sea for who could say but that one of her fifty ideas orperhaps forty nine of them wouldn t be exactly that taste byitself the taste he had always conformed to had no importancewhatever if meanwhile at all events he felt her as serious this made the greater reason for her profiting by it as sheperhaps might never be able to profit again she was invokingthat reflection at the very moment he brought out in reply toher last words a remark which though perfectly relevant andperfectly just affected her at first as a high oddity they redoing the wisest thing you know for if they were ever togo and he looked down at her over his cigar if they were ever to go in short it was high time with herfather s age charlotte s need of initiation and the generalmagnitude of the job of their getting settled and seasoned theirlearning to live into their queer future it was high time thatthey should take up their courage this was eminent sense but itdidn t arrest the princess who the next moment had found aform for her challenge but shan t you then so much as miss hera little she s wonderful and beautiful and i feel somehow as ifshe were dying not really not physically maggie went on she s so far naturally splendid as she is from having donewith life but dying for us for you and me and making us feelit by the very fact of there being so much of her left the prince smoked hard a minute as you say she s splendid butthere is there always will be much of her left only as youalso say for others and yet i think the princess returned that it isn t as if wehad wholly done with her how can we not always think of her it s as if her unhappiness had been necessary to us as if we hadneeded her at her own cost to build us up and start us he took it in with consideration but he met it with a lucidinquiry why do you speak of the unhappiness of your father swife they exchanged a long look the time that it took her to find herreply because not to well not to would make me have to speak of him and i can t said maggie speak of him you can t i can t she said it as for definite notice not to berepeated there are too many things she nevertheless added he s too great the prince looked at his cigar tip and then as he put back theweed too great for whom upon which as she hesitated not mydear too great for you he declared for me oh as much asyou like too great for me is what i mean i know why i think it maggiesaid that s enough he looked at her yet again as if she but fanned his wonder hewas on the very point she judged of asking her why she thoughtit but her own eyes maintained their warning and at the end ofa minute he had uttered other words what s of importance isthat you re his daughter that at least we ve got and i supposethat if i may say nothing else i may say at least that i valueit oh yes you may say that you value it i myself make the most ofit this again he took in letting it presently put forth for him astriking connection she ought to have known you that s what spresent to me she ought to have understood you better better than you did yes he gravely maintained better than i did and she didn treally know you at all she doesn t know you now ah yes she does said maggie but he shook his head he knew what he meant she not onlydoesn t understand you more than i she understands you ever somuch less though even i well even you maggie pressed as he paused even i even ieven yet again he paused and the silence held them but maggie at last broke it if charlotte doesn t understand me it is that i ve prevented her i ve chosen to deceive her and tolie to her the prince kept his eyes on her i know what you ve chosen todo but i ve chosen to do the same yes said maggie after an instant my choice was made when ihad guessed yours but you mean she asked that sheunderstands you it presents small difficulty are you so sure maggie went on sure enough but it doesn t matter he waited an instant thenlooking up through the fumes of his smoke she s stupid heabruptly opined o oh maggie protested in a long wail it had made him in fact quickly change colour what i mean isthat she s not as you pronounce her unhappy and he recovered with this all his logic why is she unhappy if she doesn tknow doesn t know she tried to make his logic difficult doesn t know that you know it came from him in such a way that she was conscious instantly of three or four things to answer but what she said first was do you think that s all it need take and before he couldreply she knows she knows maggie proclaimed well then what but she threw back her head she turned impatiently away fromhim oh i needn t tell you she knows enough besides shewent on she doesn t believe us it made the prince stare a little ah she asks too much thatdrew however from his wife another moan of objection whichdetermined in him a judgment she won t let you take her forunhappy oh i know better than any one else what she won t let me takeher for very well said amerigo you ll see i shall see wonders i know i ve already seen them and i mprepared for them maggie recalled she had memories enough it s terrible her memories prompted her to speak i see it salways terrible for women the prince looked down in his gravity everything s terrible cara in the heart of man she s making her life he said she ll make it his wife turned back upon him she had wandered to a table vaguely setting objects straight a little by the way then too while she s about it she s making ours at this he raised hiseyes which met her own and she held him while she deliveredherself of some thing that had been with her these last minutes you spoke just now of charlotte s not having learned from youthat i know am i to take from you then that you accept andrecognise my knowledge he did the inquiry all the honours visibly weighed itsimportance and weighed his response you think i might have beenshowing you that a little more handsomely it isn t a question of any beauty said maggie it s only aquestion of the quantity of truth oh the quantity of truth the prince richly thoughambiguously murmured that s a thing by itself yes but there are also such things all the same as questions of good faith of course there are the prince hastened to reply after whichhe brought up more slowly if ever a man since the beginning oftime acted in good faith but he dropped it offering it simplyfor that for that then when it had had time somewhat to settle like somehandful of gold dust thrown into the air for that then maggieshowed herself as deeply and strangely taking it i see andshe even wished this form to be as complete as she could make it i see the completeness clearly after an instant had struck him asdivine ah my dear my dear my dear it was all he couldsay she wasn t talking however at large you ve kept up for solong a silence yes yes i know what i ve kept up but will you do he asked still one thing more for me it was as if for an instant with her new exposure it had madeher turn pale is there even one thing left ah my dear my dear my dear it had pressed again in him thefine spring of the unspeakable there was nothing however thatthe princess herself couldn t say i ll do anything if you lltell me what then wait and his raised italian hand with its play ofadmonitory fingers had never made gesture more expressive hisvoice itself dropped to a tone wait he repeated wait she understood but it was as if she wished to have it from him till they ve been here you mean yes till they ve gone till they re away she kept it up till they ve left the country she had her eyeson him for clearness these were the conditions of a promise sothat he put the promise practically into his response tillwe ve ceased to see them for as long as god may grant tillwe re really alone oh if it s only that when she had drawn from him thus then as she could feel the thick breath of the definite which wasthe intimate the immediate the familiar as she hadn t had themfor so long she turned away again she put her hand on the knobof the door but her hand rested at first without a grasp shehad another effort to make the effort of leaving him of whicheverything that had just passed between them his presence irresistible overcharged with it doubled the difficulty therewas something she couldn t have told what it was as if shut intogether they had come too far too far for where they were sothat the mere act of her quitting him was like the attempt torecover the lost and gone she had taken in with her somethingthat within the ten minutes and especially within the lastthree or four had slipped away from her which it was vain now wasn t it to try to appear to clutch or to pick up thatconsciousness in fact had a pang and she balanced intensely for the lingering moment almost with a terror of her endlesspower of surrender he had only to press really for her toyield inch by inch and she fairly knew at present while shelooked at him through her cloud that the confession of thisprecious secret sat there for him to pluck the sensation forthe few seconds was extraordinary her weakness her desire solong as she was yet not saving herself flowered in her face likea light or a darkness she sought for some word that would coverthis up she reverted to the question of tea speaking as if theyshouldn t meet sooner then about five i count on you on him too however something had descended as to which thisexactly gave him his chance ah but i shall see you no hesaid coming nearer she had with her hand still on the knob her back against thedoor so that her retreat under his approach must be less than astep and yet she couldn t for her life with the other hand have pushed him away he was so near now that she could touchhim taste him smell him kiss him hold him he almost pressedupon her and the warmth of his face frowning smiling shemightn t know which only beautiful and strange was bent uponher with the largeness with which objects loom in dreams sheclosed her eyes to it and so the next instant against herpurpose she had put out her hand which had met his own andwhich he held then it was that from behind her closed eyes theright word came wait it was the word of his own distress andentreaty the word for both of them all they had left theirplank now on the great sea their hands were locked and thus shesaid it again wait wait she kept her eyes shut but herhand she knew helped her meaning which after a minute she wasaware his own had absorbed he let her go he turned away withthis message and when she saw him again his back was presented as he had left her and his face staring out of the window shehad saved herself and she got off xliilater on in the afternoon before the others arrived the formof their reunion was at least remarkable they might in theirgreat eastward drawing room have been comparing notes or nervesin apprehension of some stiff official visit maggie s mind inits restlessness even played a little with the prospect thehigh cool room with its afternoon shade with its old tapestriesuncovered with the perfect polish of its wide floor reflectingthe bowls of gathered flowers and the silver and linen of theprepared tea table drew from her a remark in which this wholeeffect was mirrored as well as something else in the prince smovement while he slowly paced and turned we re distinctlybourgeois she a trifle grimly threw off as an echo of theirold community though to a spectator sufficiently detached theymight have been quite the privileged pair they were reputed granted only they were taken as awaiting the visit of royalty they might have been ready on the word passed up in advance torepair together to the foot of the staircase the prince somewhatin front advancing indeed to the open doors and even going down for all his princedom to meet on the stopping of the chariot the august emergence the time was stale it was to be admitted for incidents of magnitude the september hush was in fullpossession at the end of the dull day and a couple of the longwindows stood open to the balcony that overhung the desolation the balcony from which maggie in the springtime had seenamerigo and charlotte look down together at the hour of herreturn from the regent s park near by with her father theprincipino and miss bogle amerigo now again in his punctualimpatience went out a couple of times and stood there afterwhich as to report that nothing was in sight he returned to theroom with frankly nothing else to do the princess pretended toread he looked at her as he passed there hovered in her ownsense the thought of other occasions when she had cheatedappearances of agitation with a book at last she felt himstanding before her and then she raised her eyes do you remember how this morning when you told me of thisevent i asked you if there were anything particular you wishedme to do you spoke of my being at home but that was a matter ofcourse you spoke of something else he went on while she satwith her book on her knee and her raised eyes something thatmakes me almost wish it may happen you spoke he said of thepossibility of my seeing her alone do you know if that comes he asked the use i shall make of it and then as she waited the use is all before me ah it s your own business now said his wife but it had madeher rise i shall make it my own he answered i shall tell her i liedto her ah no she returned and i shall tell her you did she shook her head again oh still less with which therefore they stood at difference he with his headerect and his happy idea perched in its eagerness on his crest and how then is she to know she isn t to know she s only still to think you don t and therefore that i m always a fool she may think saidmaggie what she likes think it without my protest the princess made a movement what business is it of yours isn t it my right to correct her maggie let his question ring ring long enough for him to hear ithimself only then she took it up correct her and it washer own now that really rang aren t you rather forgetting whoshe is after which while he quite stared for it as it was thevery first clear majesty he had known her to use she flung downher book and raised a warning hand the carriage come the come had matched for lucid firmness the rest of herspeech and when they were below in the hall there was a go for him through the open doors and between the ranged servants that matched even that he received royalty bareheaded therefore in the persons of mr and mrs verver as it alightedon the pavement and maggie was at the threshold to welcome it toher house later on upstairs again she even herself felt stillmore the force of the limit of which she had just reminded him at tea in charlotte s affirmed presence as charlotte affirmedit she drew a long breath of richer relief it was thestrangest once more of all impressions but what she most felt for the half hour was that mr and mrs verver were making theoccasion easy they were somehow conjoined in it conjoined for apresent effect as maggie had absolutely never yet seen them andthere occurred before long a moment in which amerigo s look mether own in recognitions that he couldn t suppress the questionof the amount of correction to which charlotte had laid herselfopen rose and hovered for the instant only to sink conspicuously by its own weight so high a pitch she seemed togive to the unconsciousness of questions so resplendent a showof serenity she succeeded in making the shade of the official in her beauty and security never for a moment dropped it was acool high refuge like the deep arched recess of some colouredand gilded image in which she sat and smiled and waited drankher tea referred to her husband and remembered her mission hermission had quite taken form it was but another name for theinterest of her great opportunity that of representing the artsand the graces to a people languishing afar off in ignorance maggie had sufficiently intimated to the prince ten minutesbefore that she needed no showing as to what their friendwouldn t consent to be taken for but the difficulty now indeedwas to choose for explicit tribute of admiration between thevarieties of her nobler aspects she carried it off to put thematter coarsely with a taste and a discretion that held ouryoung woman s attention for the first quarter of an hour to thevery point of diverting it from the attitude of her overshadowed her almost superseded companion but adam verver profited indeedat this time even with his daughter by his so markedpeculiarity of seeming on no occasion to have an attitude and solong as they were in the room together she felt him still simplyweave his web and play out his long fine cord knew herself inpresence of this tacit process very much as she had known herselfat fawns he had a way the dear man wherever he was of movingabout the room noiselessly to see what it might contain andhis manner of now resorting to this habit acquainted as healready was with the objects in view expressed with a certainsharpness the intention of leaving his wife to her devices itdid even more than this it signified to the apprehension of theprincess from the moment she more directly took thought of him almost a special view of these devices as actually exhibited intheir rarity together with an independent a settledappreciation of their general handsome adequacy which scarcelyrequired the accompaniment of his faint contemplative hum charlotte throned as who should say between her hostess and herhost the whole scene having crystallised as soon as she tookher place to the right quiet lustre the harmony was not lesssustained for being superficial and the only approach to a breakin it was while amerigo remained standing long enough for hisfather in law vaguely wondering to appeal to him invite oraddress him and then in default of any such word selected forpresentation to the other visitor a plate of petits fours maggiewatched her husband if it now could be called watching offerthis refreshment she noted the consummate way for consummate was the term she privately applied in which charlotte clearedher acceptance cleared her impersonal smile of any betrayal any slightest value of consciousness and then felt the slowsurge of a vision that at the end of another minute or two hadfloated her across the room to where her father stood looking ata picture an early florentine sacred subject that he had givenher on her marriage he might have been in silence taking hislast leave of it it was a work for which he entertained sheknew an unqualified esteem the tenderness represented for herby his sacrifice of such a treasure had become to her sense apart of the whole infusion of the immortal expression thebeauty of his sentiment looked out at her always from thebeauty of the rest as if the frame made positively a window forhis spiritual face she might have said to herself at thismoment that in leaving the thing behind him held as in herclasping arms he was doing the most possible toward leaving hera part of his palpable self she put her hand over his shoulder and their eyes were held again together by the abidingfelicity they smiled in emulation vaguely as if speech failedthem through their having passed too far she would have begun towonder the next minute if it were reserved to them for the laststage to find their contact like that of old friends reunitedtoo much on the theory of the unchanged subject to shy lapses it s all right eh oh my dear rather he had applied the question to the great fact of the picture asshe had spoken for the picture in reply but it was as if theirwords for an instant afterwards symbolised another truth so thatthey looked about at everything else to give them this extension she had passed her arm into his and the other objects in theroom the other pictures the sofas the chairs the tables thecabinets the important pieces supreme in their way stoodout round them consciously for recognition and applause theireyes moved together from piece to piece taking in the wholenobleness quite as if for him to measure the wisdom of oldideas the two noble persons seated in conversation at tea fell thus into the splendid effect and the general harmony mrs verver and the prince fairly placed themselves howeverunwittingly as high expressions of the kind of human furniturerequired esthetically by such a scene the fusion of theirpresence with the decorative elements their contribution to thetriumph of selection was complete and admirable though to alingering view a view more penetrating than the occasion reallydemanded they also might have figured as concrete attestationsof a rare power of purchase there was much indeed in the tone inwhich adam verver spoke again and who shall say where histhought stopped le compte y est you ve got some good things maggie met it afresh ah don t they look well theircompanions at the sound of this gave them in a spaciousintermission of slow talk an attention all of gravity that waslike an ampler submission to the general duty of magnificence sitting as still to be thus appraised as a pair of effigies ofthe contemporary great on one of the platforms of madame tussaud i m so glad for your last look with which after maggie quite in the air had said it the notewas struck indeed the note of that strange accepted finality ofrelation as from couple to couple which almost escaped anawkwardness only by not attempting a gloss yes this was thewonder that the occasion defied insistence precisely because ofthe vast quantities with which it dealt so that separation wason a scale beyond any compass of parting to do such an hourjustice would have been in some degree to question its grounds which was why they remained in fine the four of them in theupper air united in the firmest abstention from pressure therewas no point visibly at which face to face either amerigo orcharlotte had pressed and how little she herself was in dangerof doing so maggie scarce needed to remember that her fatherwouldn t by the tip of a toe of that she was equally conscious the only thing was that since he didn t she could but hold herbreath for what he would do instead when at the end of threeminutes more he had said with an effect of suddenness well mag and the principino it was quite as if that were bycontrast the hard the truer voice she glanced at the clock i ordered him for half past five which hasn t yet struck trust him my dear not to fail you oh i don t want him to fail me was mr verver s reply yetuttered in so explicitly jocose a relation to the possibilitiesof failure that even when just afterwards he wandered in hisimpatience to one of the long windows and passed out to thebalcony she asked herself but for a few seconds if reality should she follow him would overtake or meet her there shefollowed him of necessity it came absolutely so near to hisinviting her by stepping off into temporary detachment to givethe others something of the chance that she and her husband hadso fantastically discussed beside him then while they hung overthe great dull place clear and almost coloured now colouredwith the odd sad pictured old fashioned look that emptylondon streets take on in waning afternoons of the summer s end she felt once more how impossible such a passage would have beento them how it would have torn them to pieces if they had somuch as suffered its suppressed relations to peep out of theireyes this danger would doubtless indeed have been more to bereckoned with if the instinct of each she could certainly atleast answer for her own had not so successfully acted to trumpup other apparent connexions for it connexions as to which theycould pretend to be frank you mustn t stay on here you know adam verver said as aresult of his unobstructed outlook fawns is all there for you of course to the end of my tenure but fawns so dismantled headded with mild ruefulness fawns with half its contents andhalf its best things removed won t seem to you i m afraid particularly lively no maggie answered we should miss its best things its bestthings my dear have certainly been removed to be back there she went on to be back there and she paused for the forceof her idea oh to be back there without anything good but she didn thesitate now she brought her idea forth to be back therewithout charlotte is more than i think would do and as shesmiled at him with it so she saw him the next instant take it take it in a way that helped her smile to pass all for anallusion to what she didn t and couldn t say this quantity wastoo clear that she couldn t at such an hour be pretending toname to him what it was as he would have said going to be atfawns or anywhere else to want for him that was now and in amanner exaltedly sublimely out of their compass and theirquestion so that what was she doing while they waited for theprincipino while they left the others together and their tensionjust sensibly threatened what was she doing but just offer abold but substantial substitute nothing was stranger moreover under the action of charlotte s presence than the fact of a feltsincerity in her words she felt her sincerity absolutely sound she gave it for all it might mean because charlotte dear youknow she said is incomparable it took thirty seconds butshe was to know when these were over that she had pronounced oneof the happiest words of her life they had turned from the viewof the street they leaned together against the balcony rail with the room largely in sight from where they stood but withthe prince and mrs verver out of range nothing he could try she immediately saw was to keep his eyes from lighting not evenhis taking out his cigarette case and saying before he saidanything else may i smoke she met it for encouragement withher my dear again and then while he struck his match shehad just another minute to be nervous a minute that she made useof however not in the least to falter but to reiterate with ahigh ring a ring that might for all she cared reach the pairinside father father charlotte s great it was not till after he had begun to smoke that he looked ather charlotte s great they could close upon it such a basis as they might immediatelyfeel it make and so they stood together over it quitegratefully each recording to the other s eyes that it was firmunder their feet they had even thus a renewed wait as for proofof it much as if he were letting her see while the minuteslapsed for their concealed companions that this was finally justwhy but just why you see he presently added how right iwas right i mean to do it for you ah rather she murmured with her smile and then as to beherself ideally right i don t see what you would have donewithout her the point was he returned quietly that i didn t see what youwere to do yet it was a risk it was a risk said maggie but i believed in it at least formyself she smiled well now he smoked we see we see i know her better you know her best oh but naturally on which as the warranted truth of it hungin the air the truth warranted as who should say exactly bythe present opportunity to pronounce this opportunity createdand accepted she found herself lost though with a finer thrillthan she had perhaps yet known in the vision of all he mightmean the sense of it in her rose higher rose with each momentthat he invited her thus to see him linger and when after alittle more he had said smoking again and looking up with headthrown back and hands spread on the balcony rail at the grey gaunt front of the house she s beautiful beautiful hersensibility reported to her the shade of a new note it was allshe might have wished for it was with a kind of speakingcompetence the note of possession and control and yet itconveyed to her as nothing till now had done the reality of theirparting they were parting in the light of it absolutely oncharlotte s value the value that was filling the room out ofwhich they had stepped as if to give it play and with which theprince on his side was perhaps making larger acquaintance ifmaggie had desired at so late an hour some last conclusivecomfortable category to place him in for dismissal she mighthave found it here in its all coming back to his ability to restupon high values somehow when all was said and with the memoryof her gifts her variety her power so much remained ofcharlotte s what else had she herself meant three minutes beforeby speaking of her as great great for the world that was beforeher that he proposed she should be she was not to be wasted inthe application of his plan maggie held to this then that shewasn t to be wasted to let his daughter know it he had soughtthis brief privacy what a blessing accordingly that she couldspeak her joy in it his face meanwhile at all events wasturned to her and as she met his eyes again her joy wentstraight it s success father it s success and even this he added as the principino appearing alone deep within piped across an instant greeting even this isn t altogether failure they went in to receive the boy upon whose introduction to theroom by miss bogle charlotte and the prince got up seeminglywith an impressiveness that had caused miss bogle not to givefurther effect to her own entrance she had retired but theprincipino s presence by itself sufficiently broke thetension the subsidence of which in the great room ten minuteslater gave to the air something of the quality produced by thecessation of a sustained rattle stillness when the prince andprincess returned from attending the visitors to their carriage might have been said to be not so much restored as created sothat whatever next took place in it was foredoomed to remarkablesalience that would have been the case even with so natural though so futile a movement as maggie s going out to the balconyagain to follow with her eyes her father s departure thecarriage was out of sight it had taken her too long solemnly toreascend and she looked awhile only at the great grey space onwhich as on the room still more the shadow of dusk had fallen here at first her husband had not rejoined her he had come upwith the boy who clutching his hand abounded as usual inremarks worthy of the family archives but the two appeared thento have proceeded to report to miss bogle it meant something forthe princess that her husband had thus got their son out of theway not bringing him back to his mother but everything now asshe vaguely moved about struck her as meaning so much that theunheard chorus swelled yet this above all her just being thereas she was and waiting for him to come in their freedom to betogether there always was the meaning most disengaged she stoodin the cool twilight and took in all about her where it lurked her reason for what she had done she knew at last really why and how she had been inspired and guided how she had beenpersistently able how to her soul all the while it had beenfor the sake of this end here it was then the moment thegolden fruit that had shone from afar only what were thesethings in the fact for the hand and for the lips when tested when tasted what were they as a reward closer than she had everbeen to the measure of her course and the full face of her act she had an instant of the terror that when there has beensuspense always precedes on the part of the creature to bepaid the certification of the amount amerigo knew it theamount he still held it and the delay in his return making herheart beat too fast to go on was like a sudden blinding light ona wild speculation she had thrown the dice but his hand wasover her cast he opened the door however at last he hadn t been away tenminutes and then with her sight of him renewed to intensity she seemed to have a view of the number his presence alone ashe paused to look at her somehow made it the highest and evenbefore he had spoken she had begun to be paid in full with thatconsciousness in fact an extraordinary thing occurred theassurance of her safety so making her terror drop that already within the minute it had been changed to concern for his ownanxiety for everything that was deep in his being and everythingthat was fair in his face so far as seeing that she was paid went he might have been holding out the money bag for her tocome and take it but what instantly rose for her between theact and her acceptance was the sense that she must strike him aswaiting for a confession this in turn charged her with a newhorror if that was her proper payment she would go withoutmoney his acknowledgment hung there too monstrously at theexpense of charlotte before whose mastery of the greater styleshe had just been standing dazzled all she now knew accordingly was that she should be ashamed to listen to theuttered word all that is but that she might dispose of it onthe spot forever isn t she too splendid she simply said offering it to explainand to finish oh splendid with which he came over to her that s our help you see she added to point further hermoral it kept him before her therefore taking in or trying to whatshe so wonderfully gave he tried too clearly to please her tomeet her in her own way but with the result only that close

strangely lighted his eyes that as for pity anddread of them she buried her own in his breast glassesby henry jameschapter iyes indeed i say to myself pen in hand i can keep hold of thethread and let it lead me back to the first impression the littlestory is all there i can touch it from point to point for thethread as i call it is a row of coloured beads on a string noneof the beads are missing at least i think they re not that sexactly what i shall amuse myself with finding out i had been all summer working hard in town and then had gone downto folkestone for a blow art was long i felt and my holidayshort my mother was settled at folkestone and i paid her a visitwhen i could i remember how on this occasion after weeks in mystuffy studio with my nose on my palette i sniffed up the cleansalt air and cooled my eyes with the purple sea the place wasfull of lodgings and the lodgings were at that season full ofpeople people who had nothing to do but to stare at one another onthe great flat down there were thousands of little chairs andalmost as many little jews and there was music in an open rotunda over which the little jews wagged their big noses we all strolledto and fro and took pennyworths of rest the long level cliff top edged in places with its iron rail might have been the deck of ahuge crowded ship there were old folks in bath chairs and therewas one dear chair creeping to its last full stop by the side ofwhich i always walked there was in fine weather the coast offrance to look at and there were the usual things to say about it there was also in every state of the atmosphere our friend mrs meldrum a subject of remark not less inveterate the widow of anofficer in the engineers she had settled like many members of themartial miscellany well within sight of the hereditary enemy whohowever had left her leisure to form in spite of the difference oftheir years a close alliance with my mother she was theheartiest the keenest the ugliest of women the least apologetic the least morbid in her misfortune she carried it high aloft withloud sounds and free gestures made it flutter in the breeze as ifit had been the flag of her country it consisted mainly of a bigred face indescribably out of drawing from which she glared atyou through gold rimmed aids to vision optic circles of suchdiameter and so frequently displaced that some one had vividlyspoken of her as flattering her nose against the glass of herspectacles she was extraordinarily near sighted and whateverthey did to other objects they magnified immensely the kind eyesbehind them blest conveniences they were in their hideous honest strength they showed the good lady everything in the worldbut her own queerness this element was enhanced by wild braveriesof dress reckless charges of colour and stubborn resistances ofcut wondrous encounters in which the art of the toilet seemed tolay down its life she had the tread of a grenadier and the voiceof an angel in the course of a walk with her the day after my arrival i foundmyself grabbing her arm with sudden and undue familiarity i hadbeen struck by the beauty of a face that approached us and i wasstill more affected when i saw the face at the sight of mycompanion open like a window thrown wide a smile fluttered outof it an brightly as a drapery dropped from a sill a draperyshaken there in the sun by a young lady flanked by two young men awonderful young lady who as we drew nearer rushed up to mrs meldrum with arms flourished for an embrace my immediateimpression of her had been that she was dressed in mourning butduring the few moments she stood talking with our friend i mademore discoveries the figure from the neck down was meagre thestature insignificant but the desire to please towered high aswell as the air of infallibly knowing how and of never nevermissing it this was a little person whom i would have made a highbid for a good chance to paint the head the features thecolour the whole facial oval and radiance had a wonderful purity the deep grey eyes the most agreeable i thought that i had everseen brushed with a kind of winglike grace every object theyencountered their possessor was just back from boulogne whereshe had spent a week with dear mrs floyd taylor this accountedfor the effusiveness of her reunion with dear mrs meldrum herblack garments were of the freshest and daintiest she suggested apink and white wreath at a showy funeral she confounded us forthree minutes with her presence she was a beauty of the greatconscious public responsible order the young men her companions gazed at her and grinned i could see there were very few momentsof the day at which young men these or others would not be sooccupied the people who approached took leave of their manners every one seemed to linger and gape when she brought her faceclose to mrs meldrum s and she appeared to be always bringing itclose to somebody s it was a marvel that objects so dissimilarshould express the same general identity the unmistakablecharacter of the english gentlewoman mrs meldrum sustained thecomparison with her usual courage but i wondered why she didn tintroduce me i should have had no objection to the bringing ofsuch a face close to mine however by the time the young ladymoved on with her escort she herself bequeathed me a sense thatsome such rapprochement might still occur was this by reason ofthe general frequency of encounters at folkestone or by reason ofa subtle acknowledgment that she contrived to make of the rights on the part of others that such beauty as hers created i was ina position to answer that question after mrs meldrum had answereda few of mine chapter iiflora saunt the only daughter of an old soldier had lost both herparents her mother within a few months mrs meldrum had knownthem disapproved of them considerably avoided them she hadwatched the girl off and on from her early childhood flora just twenty was extraordinarily alone in the world so alone thatshe had no natural chaperon no one to stay with but a mercenarystranger mrs hammond synge the sister in law of one of the youngmen i had just seen she had lots of friends but none of themnice she kept picking up impossible people the floyd taylors with whom she had been at boulogne were simply horrid thehammond synges were perhaps not so vulgar but they had noconscience in their dealings with her she knows what i think of them said mrs meldrum and indeedshe knows what i think of most things she shares that privilege with most of your friends i repliedlaughing no doubt but possibly to some of my friends it makes a littledifference that girl doesn t care a button she knows best ofall what i think of flora saunt and what may your opinion be why that she s not worth troubling about an idiot too abysmal doesn t she care for that just enough as you saw to hug me till i cry out she s toopleased with herself for anything else to matter surely my dear friend i rejoined she has a good deal to bepleased with so every one tells her and so you would have told her if i hadgiven you the chance however that doesn t signify either forher vanity is beyond all making or mending she believes inherself and she s welcome after all poor dear having onlyherself to look to i ve seldom met a young woman more completelyfree to be silly she has a clear course she ll make a showyfinish well i replied as she probably will reduce many persons to thesame degraded state her partaking of it won t stand out so much if you mean that the world s full of twaddlers i quite agree withyou cried mrs meldrum trumpeting her laugh half across thechannel i had after this to consider a little what she would call mymother s son but i didn t let it prevent me from insisting on hermaking me acquainted with flora saunt indeed i took the bull bythe horns urging that she had drawn the portrait of a nature whichcommon charity now demanded of her to put into relation with acharacter really fine such a frail creature was just an object ofpity this contention on my part had at first of course beenjocular but strange to say it was quite the ground i found myselftaking with regard to our young lady after i had begun to know her i couldn t have said what i felt about her except that she wasundefended from the first of my sitting with her there afterdinner under the stars that was a week at folkestone of balmynights and muffled tides and crowded chairs i became aware boththat protection was wholly absent from her life and that she waswholly indifferent to its absence the odd thing was that she wasnot appealing she was abjectly divinely conceited absurdlyfantastically pleased her beauty was as yet all the world to her a world she had plenty to do to live in mrs meldrum told me moreabout her and there was nothing that as the centre of a group ofgiggling nudging spectators flora wasn t ready to tell aboutherself she held her little court in the crowd upon the grass playing her light over jews and gentiles completely at ease in allpromiscuities it was an effect of these things that from the veryfirst with every one listening i could mention that my mainbusiness with her would be just to have a go at her head and toarrange in that view for an early sitting it would have been asimpossible i think to be impertinent to her as it would have beento throw a stone at a plate glass window so any talk that wentforward on the basis of her loveliness was the most natural thingin the world and immediately became the most general and sociable it was when i saw all this that i judged how though it was thelast thing she asked for what one would ever most have at herservice was a curious compassion that sentiment was coloured bythe vision of the dire exposure of a being whom vanity had put sooff her guard hers was the only vanity i have ever known thatmade its possessor superlatively soft mrs meldrum s furtherinformation contributed moreover to these indulgences her accountof the girl s neglected childhood and queer continentalrelegations with straying squabbling monte carlo haunting parents the more invidious picture above all of her pecuniaryarrangement still in force with the hammond synges who really though they never took her out practically she went out alone hadtheir hands half the time in her pocket she had to pay foreverything down to her share of the wine bills and the horses fodder down to bertie hammond synge s fare in the underground when he went to the city for her she had been left with justmoney enough to turn her head and it hadn t even been put intrust nothing prudent or proper had been done with it she couldspend her capital and at the rate she was going expensive extravagant and with a swarm of parasites to help it certainlywouldn t last very long couldn t you perhaps take her independent unencumbered as youare i asked of mrs meldrum you re probably with oneexception the sanest person she knows and you at least wouldn tscandalously fleece her how do you know what i wouldn t do my humorous friend demanded of course i ve thought how i can help her it has kept me awake atnight but doing it s impossible she ll take nothing from me you know what she does she hugs me and runs away she has aninstinct about me and feels that i ve one about her and then shedislikes me for another reason that i m not quite clear about butthat i m well aware of and that i shall find out some day so faras her settling with me goes it would be impossible moreover here she wants naturally enough a much wider field she must live inlondon her game is there so she takes the line of adoring me ofsaying she can never forget that i was devoted to her mother whichi wouldn t for the world have been and of giving me a wide berth i think she positively dislikes to look at me it s all right there s no obligation though people in general can t take theireyes off me i see that at this moment i replied but what does it matterwhere or how for the present she lives she ll marry infallibly marry early and everything then will change whom will she marry my companion gloomily asked any one she likes she s so abnormally pretty that she can doanything she ll fascinate some nabob or some prince she ll fascinate him first and bore him afterwards moreovershe s not so pretty as you make her out she hasn t a scrap of afigure no doubt but one doesn t in the least miss it not now said mrs meldrum but one will when she s older andwhen everything will have to count when she s older she ll count as a princess so it won t matter she has other drawbacks my companion went on those wonderfuleyes are good for nothing but to roll about like sugar balls whichthey greatly resemble in a child s mouth she can t use them use them why she does nothing else to make fools of young men but not to read or write not to doany sort of work she never opens a book and her maid writes hernotes you ll say that those who live in glass houses shouldn tthrow stones of course i know that if i didn t wear my goggles ishouldn t be good for much do you mean that miss saunt ought to sport such things iexclaimed with more horror than i meant to show i don t prescribe for her i don t know that they re what sherequires what s the matter with her eyes i asked after a moment i don t exactly know but i heard from her mother years ago thateven as a child they had had for a while to put her into spectaclesand that though she hated them and had been in a fury of disgust she would always have to be extremely careful i m sure i hope sheis i echoed the hope but i remember well the impression this madeupon me my immediate pang of resentment a disgust almost equal toflora s own i felt as if a great rare sapphire had split in myhand chapter iiithis conversation occurred the night before i went back to town isettled on the morrow to take a late train so that i had still mymorning to spend at folkestone where during the greater part of iti was out with my mother every one in the place was as usual outwith some one else and even had i been free to go and take leaveof her i should have been sure that flora saunt would not be athome just where she was i presently discovered she was at thefar end of the cliff the point at which it overhangs the prettyview of sandgate and hythe her back however was turned to thisattraction it rested with the aid of her elbows thrust slightlybehind her so that her scanty little shoulders were raised towardher ears on the high rail that inclosed the down two gentlemenstood before her whose faces we couldn t see but who even asobserved from the rear were visibly absorbed in the charmingfigure piece submitted to them i was freshly struck with the factthat this meagre and defective little person with the cock of herhat and the flutter of her crape with her eternal idleness hereternal happiness her absence of moods and mysteries and thepretty presentation of her feet which especially now in thesupported slope of her posture occupied with their imperceptibilityso much of the foreground i was reminded anew i say how ouryoung lady dazzled by some art that the enumeration of her meritsdidn t explain and that the mention of her lapses didn t affect where she was amiss nothing counted and where she was righteverything did i say she was wanting in mystery but that afterall was her secret this happened to be my first chance ofintroducing her to my mother who had not much left in life but thequiet look from under the hood of her chair at the things which when she should have quitted those she loved she could still trustto make the world good for them i wondered an instant how muchshe might be moved to trust flora saunt and then while the chairstood still and she waited i went over and asked the girl to comeand speak to her in this way i saw that if one of flora sattendants was the inevitable young hammond synge master ofceremonies of her regular court always offering the use of atelescope and accepting that of a cigar the other was a personagei had not yet encountered a small pale youth in showyknickerbockers whose eyebrows and nose and the glued points ofwhose little moustache were extraordinarily uplifted and sustained i remember taking him at first for a foreigner and for something ofa pretender i scarce know why unless because of the motive i feltin the stare he fixed on me when i asked miss saunt to come away he struck me a little as a young man practising the social art ofimpertinence but it didn t matter for flora came away withalacrity bringing all her prettiness and pleasure and gliding overthe grass in that rustle of delicate mourning which made theendless variety of her garments as a painter could take heed strike one always as the same obscure elegance she seated herselfon the floor of my mother s chair a little too much on her rightinstep as i afterwards gathered caressing her still hand smilingup into her cold face commending and approving her without areserve and without a doubt she told her immediately as if itwere something for her to hold on by that she was soon to sit tome for a likeness and these words gave me a chance to enquire ifit would be the fate of the picture should i finish it to bepresented to the young man in the knickerbockers her lips atthis parted in a stare her eyes darkened to the purple of one ofthe shadow patches on the sea she showed for the passing instantthe face of some splendid tragic mask and i remembered for theinconsequence of it what mrs meldrum had said about her sight ihad derived from this lady a worrying impulse to catechise her butthat didn t seem exactly kind so i substituted another question inquiring who the pretty young man in knickerbockers might happento be oh a gentleman i met at boulogne he has come over to see me after a moment she added lord iffield i had never heard of lord iffield but her mention of his havingbeen at boulogne helped me to give him a niche mrs meldrum hadincidentally thrown a certain light on the manners of mrs floyd taylor flora s recent hostess in that charming town a lady who it appeared had a special vocation for helping rich young men tofind a use for their leisure she had always one or other in handand had apparently on this occasion pointed her lesson at the rarecreature on the opposite coast i had a vague idea that boulognewas not a resort of the world s envied at the same time theremight very well have been a strong attraction there even for one ofthe darlings of fortune i could perfectly understand in any casethat such a darling should be drawn to folkestone by flora saunt but it was not in truth of these things i was thinking what wasuppermost in my mind was a matter which though it had no sort ofkeeping insisted just then on coming out is it true miss saunt i suddenly demanded that you re sounfortunate as to have had some warning about your beautiful eyes i was startled by the effect of my words the girl threw back herhead changing colour from brow to chin true who in the worldsays so i repented of my question in a flash the way she met itmade it seem cruel and i felt my mother look at me in somesurprise i took care in answer to flora s challenge not toincriminate mrs meldrum i answered that the rumour had reachedme only in the vaguest form and that if i had been moved to put itto the test my very real interest in her must be held responsible her blush died away but a pair of still prettier tears glistenedin its track if you ever hear such a thing said again you cansay it s a horrid lie i had brought on a commotion deeper thanany i was prepared for but it was explained in some degree by thenext words she uttered i m happy to say there s nothing thematter with any part of me whatever not the least little thing she spoke with her habitual complacency with triumphant assurance she smiled again and i could see how she wished that she hadn t sotaken me up she turned it off with a laugh i ve good eyes good teeth a good digestion and a good temper i m sound of windand limb nothing could have been more characteristic than herblush and her tears nothing less acceptable to her than to bethought not perfect in every particular she couldn t submit tothe imputation of a flaw i expressed my delight in what she toldme assuring her i should always do battle for her and as if torejoin her companions she got up from her place on my mother stoes the young men presented their backs to us they were leaningon the rail of the cliff our incident had produced a certainawkwardness and while i was thinking of what next to say sheexclaimed irrelevantly don t you know he ll be lordconsidine at that moment the youth marked for this high destinyturned round and she spoke to my mother i ll introduce him toyou he s awfully nice she beckoned and invited him with herparasol the movement struck me as taking everything for granted i had heard of lord considine and if i had not been able to placelord iffield it was because i didn t know the name of his eldestson the young man took no notice of miss saunt s appeal he onlystared a moment and then on her repeating it quietly turned hisback she was an odd creature she didn t blush at this she onlysaid to my mother apologetically but with the frankest sweetestamusement you don t mind do you he s a monster of shyness it was as if she were sorry for every one for lord iffield thevictim of a complaint so painful and for my mother the subject ofa certain slight i m sure i don t want him said my mother butflora added some promise of how she would handle him for hisrudeness she would clearly never explain anything by any failureof her own appeal there rolled over me while she took leave of usand floated back to her friends a wave of superstitious dread iseemed somehow to see her go forth to her fate and yet what shouldfill out this orb of a high destiny if not such beauty and suchjoy i had a dim idea that lord considine was a great proprietor and though there mingled with it a faint impression that ishouldn t like his son the result of the two images was a whimsicalprayer that the girl mightn t miss her possible fortune chapter ivone day in the course of the following june there was ushered intomy studio a gentleman whom i had not yet seen but with whom i hadbeen very briefly in correspondence a letter from him hadexpressed to me some days before his regret on learning that my splendid portrait of miss flora louisa saunt whose full namefigured by her own wish in the catalogue of the exhibition of theacademy had found a purchaser before the close of the privateview he took the liberty of inquiring whether i might have at hisservice some other memorial of the same lovely head somepreliminary sketch some study for the picture i had replied thati had indeed painted miss saunt more than once and that if he wereinterested in my work i should be happy to show him what i haddone mr geoffrey dawling the person thus introduced to me stumbled into my room with awkward movements and equivocal sounds a long lean confused confusing young man with a bad complexionand large protrusive teeth he bore in its most indelible pressurethe postmark as it were of oxford and as soon as he opened hismouth i perceived in addition to a remarkable revelation of gums that the text of the queer communication matched the registeredenvelope he was full of refinements and angles of dreary anddistinguished knowledge of his unconscious drollery his dressfreely partook it seemed from the gold ring into which his rednecktie was passed to the square toe caps of his boots to conformwith a high sense of modernness to the fashion before the last there were moments when his overdone urbanity all suggestivestammers and interrogative quavers made him scarcely intelligible but i felt him to be a gentleman and i liked the honesty of hiserrand and the expression of his good green eyes as a worshipper at the shrine of beauty however he neededexplaining especially when i found he had no acquaintance with mybrilliant model had on the mere evidence of my picture taken ashe said a tremendous fancy to her looks i ought doubtless tohave been humiliated by the simplicity of his judgment of them ajudgment for which the rendering was lost in the subject quiteleaving out the element of art he was like the innocent readerfor whom the story is really true and the author a negligiblequantity he had come to me only because he wanted to purchase and i remember being so amused at his attitude which i had neverseen equally marked in a person of education that i asked him why for the sort of enjoyment he desired it wouldn t be more to thepoint to deal directly with the lady he stared and blushed atthis the idea clearly alarmed him he was an extraordinary case personally so modest that i could see it had never occurred to him he had fallen in love with a painted sign and seemed content justto dream of what it stood for he was the young prince in thelegend or the comedy who loses his heart to the miniature of theprincess beyond seas until i knew him better this puzzled memuch the link was so missing between his sensibility and his type he was of course bewildered by my sketches which implied in thebeholder some sense of intention and quality but for one of them a comparative failure he ended by conceiving a preference soarbitrary and so lively that taking no second look at the others he expressed his wish to possess it and fell into the extremity ofconfusion over the question of price i helped him over thatstile and he went off without having asked me a direct questionabout miss saunt yet with his acquisition under his arm hisdelicacy was such that he evidently considered his rights to belimited he had acquired none at all in regard to the original ofthe picture there were others for i was curious about him thati wanted him to feel i conceded i should have been glad of hiscarrying away a sense of ground acquired for coming back toensure this i had probably only to invite him and i perfectlyrecall the impulse that made me forbear it operated suddenly fromwithin while he hung about the door and in spite of the diffidentappeal that blinked in his gentle grin if he was smitten withflora s ghost what mightn t be the direct force of the luminarythat could cast such a shadow this source of radiance floodingmy poor place might very well happen to be present the next timehe should turn up the idea was sharp within me that there wererelations and complications it was no mission of mine to bringabout if they were to develop they should develop in their veryown sense let me say at once that they did develop and that i perhaps afterall had something to do with it if mr dawling had departedwithout a fresh appointment he was to reappear six months laterunder protection no less powerful than that of our young ladyherself i had seen her repeatedly for months she had grown toregard my studio as the temple of her beauty this miracle wasrecorded and celebrated there as nowhere else in other placesthere was occasional reference to other subjects of remark thedegree of her presumption continued to be stupefying there wasnothing so extraordinary save the degree in which she never paidfor it she was kept innocent that is she was kept safe by heregotism but she was helped also though she had now put off hermourning by the attitude of the lone orphan who had to be a lawunto herself it was as a lone orphan that she came and went as alone orphan that she was the centre of a crush the neglect of thehammond synges gave relief to this character and she made it worththeir while to be as every one said too shocking lord iffieldhad gone to india to shoot tigers but he returned in time for thepunctual private view it was he who had snapped up as floracalled it the gem of the exhibition my hope for the girl sfuture had slipped ignominiously off his back but after hispurchase of the portrait i tried to cultivate a new faith thegirl s own faith was wonderful it couldn t however be contagious too great was the limit of her sense of what painters call values her colours were laid on like blankets on a cold night how indeedcould a person speak the truth who was always posturing andbragging she was after all vulgar enough and by the time i hadmastered her profile and could almost with my eyes shut do it in asingle line i was decidedly tired of its purity which affectedme at last as inane one moved with her moreover among phenomenamismated and unrelated nothing in her talk ever matched anythingout of it lord iffield was dying of love for her but his familywas leading him a life his mother horrid woman had told someone that she would rather he should be swallowed by a tiger thanmarry a girl not absolutely one of themselves he had given hisyoung friend unmistakable signs but was lying low gaining time it was in his father s power to be both in personal and inpecuniary ways excessively nasty to him his father wouldn t lastfor ever quite the contrary and he knew how thoroughly in spiteof her youth her beauty and the swarm of her admirers some ofthem positively threatening in their passion he could trust her tohold out there were richer cleverer men there were greaterpersonages too but she liked her little viscount just as he was and liked to think that bullied and persecuted he had her thereso gratefully to rest upon she came back to me with tale upontale and it all might be or mightn t i never met my pretty modelin the world she moved it appeared in exalted circles and couldonly admire in her wealth of illustration the grandeur of herlife and the freedom of her hand i had on the first opportunity spoken to her of geoffrey dawling and she had listened to my story so far as she had the art of suchpatience asking me indeed more questions about him than i couldanswer then she had capped my anecdote with others much morestriking the disclosure of effects produced in the mostextraordinary quarters on people who had followed her intorailway carriages guards and porters even who had literally stuckthere others who had spoken to her in shops and hung about herhouse door cabmen upon her honour in london who to gaze theirfill at her had found excuses to thrust their petrifaction throughthe very glasses of four wheelers she lost herself in thesereminiscences the moral of which was that poor mr dawling wasonly one of a million when therefore the next autumn sheflourished into my studio with her odd companion at her heels herfirst care was to make clear to me that if he was now in servitudeit wasn t because she had run after him dawling explained with ahundred grins that when one wished very much to get anything oneusually ended by doing so a proposition which led me wholly todissent and our young lady to asseverate that she hadn t in theleast wished to get mr dawling she mightn t have wished to gethim but she wished to show him and i seemed to read that if shecould treat him as a trophy her affairs were rather at the ebb true there always hung from her belt a promiscuous fringe ofscalps much at any rate would have come and gone since ourseparation in july she had spent four months abroad where onswiss and italian lakes in german cities in the french capital many accidents might have happened chapter vi had been again with my mother but except mrs meldrum and thegleam of france had not found at folkestone my old resources andpastimes mrs meldrum much edified by my report of theperformances as she called them in my studio had told me that toher knowledge flora would soon be on the straw she had cut fromher capital such fine fat slices that there was almost nothing moreleft to swallow perched on her breezy cliff the good lady dazzledme as usual by her universal light she knew so much more abouteverything and everybody than i could ever squeeze out of mycolour tubes she knew that flora was acting on system andabsolutely declined to be interfered with her precious reasoningwas that her money would last as long as she should need it that amagnificent marriage would crown her charms before she should bereally pinched she had a sum put by for a liberal outfit meanwhile the proper use of the rest was to decorate her for theapproaches to the altar keep her afloat in the society in whichshe would most naturally meet her match lord iffield had beenseen with her at lucerne at cadenabbia but it was mrs meldrum sconviction that nothing was to be expected of him but the mostfutile flirtation the girl had a certain hold of him but with agreat deal of swagger he hadn t the spirit of a sheep he was infear of his father and would never commit himself in lordconsidine s lifetime the most flora might achieve was that hewouldn t marry some one else geoffrey dawling to mrs meldrum sknowledge i had told her of the young man s visit had attachedhimself on the way back from italy to the hammond synge group myinformant was in a position to be definite about this dangler sheknew about his people she had heard of him before hadn t he beena friend of one of her nephews at oxford hadn t he spent thechristmas holidays precisely three years before at her brother in law s in yorkshire taking that occasion to get himself refusedwith derision by wilful betty the second daughter of the house her sister who liked the floundering youth had written to her tocomplain of betty and that the young man should now turn up as anappendage of flora s was one of those oft cited proofs that theworld is small and that there are not enough people to go round his father had been something or other in the treasury hisgrandfather on the mother s side had been something or other in thechurch he had come into the paternal estate two or threethousand a year in hampshire but he had let the placeadvantageously and was generous to four plain sisters who lived atbournemouth and adored him the family was hideous all round butthe very salt of the earth he was supposed to be unspeakablyclever he was fond of london fond of books of intellectualsociety and of the idea of a political career that such a manshould be at the same time fond of flora saunt attested as thephrase in the first volume of gibbon has it the variety of hisinclinations i was soon to learn that he was fonder of her thanof all the other things together betty one of five and withviews above her station was at any rate felt at home to havedished herself by her perversity of course no one had looked ather since and no one would ever look at her again it would beeminently desirable that flora should learn the lesson of betty sfate i was not struck i confess with all this in my mind by anysymptom on our young lady s part of that sort of meditation theone moral she saw in anything was that of her incomparable aspect which mr dawling smitten even like the railway porters and thecabmen by the doom dealing gods had followed from london to veniceand from venice back to london again i afterwards learned thather version of this episode was profusely inexact his personalacquaintance with her had been determined by an accident remarkableenough i admit in connexion with what had gone before acoincidence at all events superficially striking at munich returning from a tour in the tyrol with two of his sisters he hadfound himself at the table d hote of his inn opposite to the fullpresentment of that face of which the mere clumsy copy had made himdream and desire he had been tossed by it to a height sovertiginous as to involve a retreat from the board but the nextday he had dropped with a resounding thud at the very feet of hisapparition on the following with an equal incoherence asacrifice even of his bewildered sisters whom he left behind hemade an heroic effort to escape by flight from a fate of which hehad already felt the cold breath that fate in london verylittle later drove him straight before it drove him one sundayafternoon in the rain to the door of the hammond synges hemarched in other words close up to the cannon that was to blow himto pieces but three weeks when he reappeared to me had elapsedsince then yet to vary my metaphor the burden he was to carryfor the rest of his days was firmly lashed to his back i don tmean by this that flora had been persuaded to contract her scope imean that he had been treated to the unconditional snub which asthe event was to show couldn t have been bettered as a means ofsecuring him she hadn t calculated but she had said never andthat word had made a bed big enough for his long legged patience he became from this moment to my mind the interesting figure in thepiece now that he had acted without my aid i was free to show him this and having on his own side something to show me he repeatedlyknocked at my door what he brought with him on these occasionswas a simplicity so huge that as i turn my ear to the past i seemeven now to hear it bumping up and down my stairs that was reallywhat i saw of him in the light of his behaviour he had fallen inlove as he might have broken his leg and the fracture was of asort that would make him permanently lame it was the whole manwho limped and lurched with nothing of him left in the sameposition as before the tremendous cleverness the literarysociety the political ambition the bournemouth sisters all seemedto flop with his every movement a little nearer to the floor ihadn t had an oxford training and i had never encountered the greatman at whose feet poor dawling had most submissively sat and whohad addressed him his most destructive sniffs but i rememberasking myself how effectively this privilege had supposed itself toprepare him for the career on which my friend appeared now to haveembarked i remember too making up my mind about the cleverness which had its uses and i suppose in impenetrable shades even itscritics but from which the friction of mere personal intercoursewas not the sort of process to extract a revealing spark heaccepted without a question both his fever and his chill and theonly thing he touched with judgment was this convenience of myfriendship he doubtless told me his simple story but the mattercomes back in a kind of sense of my being rather the mouthpiece ofmy having had to put it together for him he took it from me inthis form without a groan and i gave it him quite as it came hetook it again and again spending his odd half hours with me as iffor the very purpose of learning how idiotically he was in love he told me i made him see things to begin with hadn t i firstmade him see flora saunt i wanted him to give her up and lucidlyinformed him why on which he never protested nor contradicted never was even so alembicated as to declare just for the sake ofthe point that he wouldn t he simply and pointlessly didn t andwhen at the end of three months i asked him what was the use oftalking with such a fellow his nearest approach to a justificationwas to say that what made him want to help her was just thedeficiencies i dwelt on i could only reply without grossdevelopments oh if you re as sorry for her as that i too wasnearly as sorry for her as that but it only led me to be sorrierstill for other victims of this compassion with dawling as withme the compassion was at first in excess of any visible motive sothat when eventually the motive was supplied each could to acertain extent compliment the other on the fineness of hisforesight after he had begun to haunt my studio miss saunt quite gave it up and i finally learned that she accused me of conspiring with him toput pressure on her to marry him she didn t know i would take itthat way else she would never have brought him to see me it wasin her view a part of the conspiracy that to show him a kindness iasked him at last to sit to me i dare say moreover she wasdisgusted to hear that i had ended by attempting almost as manysketches of his beauty as i had attempted of hers what was thevalue of tributes to beauty by a hand that could so abase itself my relation to poor dawling s want of modelling was simple enough i was really digging in that sandy desert for the buried treasureof his soul chapter viit befell at this period just before christmas that on my havinggone under pressure of the season into a great shop to buy a toy ortwo my eyes fleeing from superfluity lighted at a distance on thebright concretion of flora saunt an exhibitability that held itsown even against the most plausible pinkness of the most developeddolls a huge quarter of the place the biggest bazaar on earth was peopled with these and other effigies and fantasies as well aswith purchasers and vendors haggard alike in the blaze of the gas with hesitations i was just about to appeal to flora to avertthat stage of my errand when i saw that she was accompanied by agentleman whose identity though more than a year had elapsed cameback to me from the folkestone cliff it had been associated onthat scene with showy knickerbockers at present it overflowed moresplendidly into a fur trimmed overcoat lord iffield s presencemade me waver an instant before crossing over and during thatinstant flora blank and undistinguishing as if she too were afterall weary of alternatives looked straight across at me i was onthe point of raising my hat to her when i observed that her facegave no sign i was exactly in the line of her vision but sheeither didn t see me or didn t recognise me or else had a reasonto pretend she didn t was her reason that i had displeased herand that she wished to punish me i had always thought it one ofher merits that she wasn t vindictive she at any rate simplylooked away and at this moment one of the shop girls who hadapparently gone off in search of it bustled up to her with a smallmechanical toy it so happened that i followed closely what thentook place afterwards recognising that i had been led to do so led even through the crowd to press nearer for the purpose by animpression of which in the act i was not fully conscious flora with the toy in her hand looked round at her companion thenseeing his attention had been solicited in another quarter shemoved away with the shop girl who had evidently offered to conducther into the presence of more objects of the same sort when shereached the indicated spot i was in a position still to observeher she had asked some question about the working of the toy andthe girl taking it herself began to explain the little secret flora bent her head over it but she clearly didn t understand isaw her in a manner that quickened my curiosity give a glanceback at the place from which she had come lord iffield wastalking with another young person she satisfied herself of this bythe aid of a question addressed to her own attendant she thendrew closer to the table near which she stood and turning her backto me bent her head lower over the collection of toys and moreparticularly over the small object the girl had attempted toexplain she took it again and after a moment with her face wellaverted made an odd motion of her arms and a significant littleduck of her head these slight signs singular as it may appear produced in my bosom an agitation so great that i failed to noticelord iffield s whereabouts he had rejoined her he was close uponher before i knew it or before she knew it herself i felt at thatinstant the strangest of all promptings if it could have operatedmore rapidly it would have caused me to dash between them in somesuch manner as to give flora a caution in fact as it was i thinki could have done this in time had i not been checked by acuriosity stronger still than my impulse there were three secondsduring which i saw the young man and yet let him come on didn t imake the quick calculation that if he didn t catch what flora wasdoing i too might perhaps not catch it she at any rate herselftook the alarm on perceiving her companion s nearness she made still averted another duck of her head and a shuffle of her handsso precipitate that a little tin steamboat she had been holdingescaped from them and rattled down to the floor with a sharpnessthat i hear at this hour lord iffield had already seized her arm with a violent jerk he brought her round toward him then it wasthat there met my eyes a quite distressing sight this exquisitecreature blushing glaring exposed with a pair of big black rimmed eye glasses defacing her by their position crookedlyastride of her beautiful nose she made a grab at them with herfree hand while i turned confusedly away chapter viii don t remember how soon it was i spoke to geoffrey dawling hissittings were irregular but it was certainly the very next time hegave me one has any rumour ever reached you of miss saunt s having anythingthe matter with her eyes he stared with a candour that was asufficient answer to my question backing it up with a shocked andmystified never then i asked him if he had observed in her anysymptom however disguised of embarrassed sight on which after amoment s thought he exclaimed disguised as if my use of thatword had vaguely awakened a train she s not a bit myopic hesaid she doesn t blink or contract her lids i fully recognisedthis and i mentioned that she altogether denied the impeachment owing it to him moreover to explain the ground of my inquiry igave him a sketch of the incident that had taken place before me atthe shop he knew all about lord iffield that nobleman hadfigured freely in our conversation as his preferred his injuriousrival poor dawling s contention was that if there had been adefinite engagement between his lordship and the young lady thesort of thing that was announced in the morning post renunciationand retirement would be comparatively easy to him but that havingwaited in vain for any such assurance he was entitled to act as ifthe door were not really closed or were at any rate not cruellylocked he was naturally much struck with my anecdote and stillmore with my interpretation of it there is something there is something possibly something verygrave certainly something that requires she should make use ofartificial aids she won t admit it publicly because with heridolatry of her beauty the feeling she is all made up of she seesin such aids nothing but the humiliation and the disfigurement she has used them in secret but that is evidently not enough forthe affection she suffers from apparently some definite menace has lately grown much worse she looked straight at me in theshop which was violently lighted without seeing it was i at thesame distance at folkestone where as you know i first met her where i heard this mystery hinted at and where she indignantlydenied the thing she appeared easily enough to recognise people at present she couldn t really make out anything the shop girlshowed her she has successfully concealed from the man i saw herwith that she resorts in private to a pince nez and that she doesso not only under the strictest orders from her oculist butbecause literally the poor thing can t accomplish without such helphalf the business of life iffield however has suspectedsomething and his suspicions whether expressed or kept tohimself have put him on the watch i happened to have a glimpseof the movement at which he pounced on her and caught her in theact i had thought it all out my idea explained many things anddawling turned pale as he listened to me was he rough with her he anxiously asked how can i tell what passed between them i fled from the place my companion stared do you mean to say her eyesight s going heaven forbid in that case how could she take life as she does how does she take life that s the question he sat therebewilderedly brooding the tears rose to his lids they reminded meof those i had seen in flora s the day i risked my enquiry thequestion he had asked was one that to my own satisfaction i wasready to answer but i hesitated to let him hear as yet all that myreflections had suggested i was indeed privately astonished attheir ingenuity for the present i only rejoined that it struck meshe was playing a particular game at which he went on as if hehadn t heard me suddenly haunted with a fear lost in the darkpossibility do you mean there s a danger of anything very bad my dear fellow you must ask her special adviser who in the world is her special adviser i haven t a conception but we mustn t get too excited myimpression would be that she has only to observe a few ordinaryrules to exercise a little common sense dawling jumped at this i see to stick to the pince nez to follow to the letter her oculist s prescription whatever it isand at whatever cost to her prettiness it s not a thing to betrifled with upon my honour it shan t be he roundly declared and he adjustedhimself to his position again as if we had quite settled thebusiness after a considerable interval while i botched away hesuddenly said did they make a great difference a great difference those things she had put on oh the glasses in her beauty she looked queer of course but itwas partly because one was unaccustomed there are women who lookcharming in nippers what at any rate if she does look queer she must be mad not to accept that alternative she is mad said geoffrey dawling mad to refuse you i grant besides i went on the pince nez which was a large and peculiar one was all awry she had halfpulled it off but it continued to stick and she was crimson shewas angry it must have been horrible my companion groaned it was horrible but it s still more horrible to defy allwarnings it s still more horrible to be landed in withoutsaying in what i disgustedly shrugged my shoulders after a glance at me dawling jerked round then you do believethat she may be i hesitated the thing would be to make her believe it she onlyneeds a good scare but if that fellow is shocked at the precautions she does take oh who knows i rejoined with small sincerity i don t supposeiffield is absolutely a brute i would take her with leather blinders like a shying mare criedgeoffrey dawling i had an impression that iffield wouldn t but i didn t communicateit for i wanted to pacify my friend whom i had discomposed toomuch for the purposes of my sitting i recollect that i did somegood work that morning but it also comes back to me that before weseparated he had practically revealed to me that my anecdote connecting itself in his mind with a series of observations at thetime unconscious and unregistered had covered with light thesubject of our colloquy he had had a formless perception of somesecret that drove miss saunt to subterfuges and the more hethought of it the more he guessed this secret to be the practice ofmaking believe she saw when she didn t and of cleverly keepingpeople from finding out how little she saw when one pieced thingstogether it was astonishing what ground they covered just as hewas going away he asked me from what source at folkestone thehorrid tale had proceeded when i had given him as i saw noreason not to do the name of mrs meldrum he exclaimed oh iknow all about her she s a friend of some friends of mine atthis i remembered wilful betty and said to myself that i knew someone who would probably prove more wilful still chapter viiia few days later i again heard dawling on my stairs and evenbefore he passed my threshold i knew he had something to tell i ve been down to folkestone it was necessary i should see her i forget whether he had come straight from the station he was atany rate out of breath with his news which it took me however aminute to apply you mean that you ve been with mrs meldrum yes to ask her what she knows and how she comes to know it itworked upon me awfully i mean what you told me he made avisible effort to seem quieter than he was and it showed mesufficiently that he had not been reassured i laid to comforthim and smiling at a venture a friendly hand on his arm and hedropped into my eyes fixing them an instant a strange distendedlook which might have expressed the cold clearness of all that wasto come i know now he said with an emphasis he rarely used what then did mrs meldrum tell you only one thing that signified for she has no real knowledge butthat one thing was everything what is it then why that she can t bear the sight of her his pronouns requiredsome arranging but after i had successfully dealt with them ireplied that i was quite aware of miss saunt s trick of turning herback on the good lady of folkestone only what did that prove have you never guessed i guessed as soon as she spoke dawlingtowered over me in dismal triumph it was the first time in ouracquaintance that on any ground of understanding this hadoccurred but even so remarkable an incident still left mesufficiently at sea to cause him to continue why the effect ofthose spectacles i seemed to catch the tail of his idea mrs meldrum s they re so awfully ugly and they add so to the dear woman sugliness this remark began to flash a light and when he quicklyadded she sees herself she sees her own fate my response was soimmediate that i had almost taken the words out of his mouth while i tried to fix this sudden image of flora s face glazed inand cross barred even as mrs meldrum s was glazed and barred hewent on to assert that only the horror of that image looming outat herself could be the reason of her avoiding the person who soforced it home the fact he had encountered made everythinghideously vivid and more vivid than anything else that just suchanother pair of goggles was what would have been prescribed toflora i see i see i presently returned what would become of lordiffield if she were suddenly to come out in them what indeedwould become of every one what would become of everything thiswas an enquiry that dawling was evidently unprepared to meet and icompleted it by saying at last my dear fellow for that matter what would become of you once more he turned on me his good green eyes oh i shouldn tmind the tone of his words somehow made his ugly face beautiful and idiscovered at this moment how much i really liked him none theless at the same time perversely and rudely i felt the drollside of our discussion of such alternatives it made me laugh outand say to him while i laughed you d take her even with thosethings of mrs meldrum s he remained mournfully grave i could see that he was surprised atmy rude mirth but he summoned back a vision of the lady atfolkestone and conscientiously replied even with those things ofmrs meldrum s i begged him not to resent my laughter which butexposed the fact that we had built a monstrous castle in the air didn t he see on what flimsy ground the structure rested theevidence was preposterously small he believed the worst but wewere really uninformed i shall find out the truth he promptly replied how can you if you question her you ll simply drive her toperjure herself wherein after all does it concern you to know thetruth it s the girl s own affair then why did you tell me your story i was a trifle embarrassed to warn you off i smiled he tookno more notice of these words than presently to remark that lordiffield had no serious intentions very possibly i said butyou mustn t speak as if lord iffield and you were her onlyalternatives dawling thought a moment couldn t something be got out of thepeople she has consulted she must have been to people how elsecan she have been condemned condemned to what condemned to perpetual nippers of course shehas consulted some of the big specialists but she has done it youmay be sure in the most clandestine manner and even if it weresupposable that they would tell you anything which i altogetherdoubt you would have great difficulty in finding out which menthey are therefore leave it alone never show her what yoususpect i even before he quitted me asked him to promise me this allright i promise but he was gloomy enough he was a lover facingthe fact that there was no limit to the deceit his loved one wasready to practise it made so remarkably little difference icould see by what a stretch his passionate pity would from thismoment overlook the girl s fatuity and folly she was alwaysaccessible to him that i knew for if she had told him he was anidiot to dream she could dream of him she would have rebuked theimputation of having failed to make it clear that she would alwaysbe glad to regard him as a friend what were most of her friends what were all of them but repudiated idiots i was perfectlyaware that in her conversations and confidences i myself forinstance had a niche in the gallery as regards poor dawling iknew how often he still called on the hammond synges it was notthere but under the wing of the floyd taylors that her intimacywith lord iffield most flourished at all events when a weekafter the visit i have just summarised flora s name was one morningbrought up to me i jumped at the conclusion that dawling had beenwith her and even i fear briefly entertained the thought that hehad broken his word chapter ixshe left me after she had been introduced in no suspense abouther present motive she was on the contrary in a visible fever toenlighten me but i promptly learned that for the alarm with whichshe pitiably panted our young man was not accountable she had butone thought in the world and that thought was for lord iffield ihad the strangest saddest scene with her and if it did me no othergood it at least made me at last completely understand whyinsidiously from the first she had struck me as a creature oftragedy in showing me the whole of her folly it lifted thecurtain of her misery i don t know how much she meant to tell mewhen she came i think she had had plans of elaboratemisrepresentation at any rate she found it at the end of tenminutes the simplest way to break down and sob to be wretched andtrue when she had once begun to let herself go the movement tookher off her feet the relief of it was like the cessation of acramp she shared in a word her long secret she shifted her sharppain she brought i confess tears to my own eyes tears ofhelpless tenderness for her helpless poverty her visit howeverwas not quite so memorable in itself as in some of itsconsequences the most immediate of which was that i went thatafternoon to see geoffrey dawling who had in those days rooms inwelbeck street where i presented myself at an hour late enough towarrant the supposition that he might have come in he had notcome in but he was expected and i was invited to enter and waitfor him a lady i was informed was already in his sitting room i hesitated a little at a loss it had wildly coursed through mybrain that the lady was perhaps flora saunt but when i asked ifshe were young and remarkably pretty i received so significant a no sir that i risked an advance and after a minute in thismanner found myself to my astonishment face to face with mrs meldrum oh you dear thing she exclaimed i m delighted to see you youspare me another compromising demarche but for this i should havecalled on you also know the worst at once if you see me hereit s at least deliberate it s planned plotted shameless i cameup on purpose to see him upon my word i m in love with him why if you valued my peace of mind did you let him the other day atfolkestone dawn upon my delighted eyes i found myself there inhalf an hour simply infatuated with him with a perfect sense ofeverything that can be urged against him i hold him none the lessthe very pearl of men however i haven t come up to declare mypassion i ve come to bring him news that will interest him muchmore above all i ve come to urge upon him to be careful about flora saunt about what he says and does he must be as still as a mouse she s at last really engaged but it s a tremendous secret i was moved to mirth precisely she wired me this noon and spent another shilling totell me that not a creature in the world is yet to know it she had better have spent it to tell you that she had just passedan hour with the creature you see before you she has just passed an hour with every one in the place mrs meldrum cried they ve vital reasons she says for it s notcoming out for a month then it will be formally announced butmeanwhile her rejoicing is wild i daresay mr dawling alreadyknows and as it s nearly seven o clock may have jumped off londonbridge but an effect of the talk i had with him the other day wasto make me on receipt of my telegram feel it to be my duty towarn him in person against taking action so to call it on thehorrid certitude which i could see he carried away with him i hadadded somehow to that certitude he told me what you had told himyou had seen in your shop mrs meldrum i perceived had come to welbeck street on an errandidentical with my own a circumstance indicating her rare sagacity inasmuch as her ground for undertaking it was a very differentthing from what flora s wonderful visit had made of mine iremarked to her that what i had seen in the shop was sufficientlystriking but that i had seen a great deal more that morning in mystudio in short i said i ve seen everything she was mystified everything the poor creature is under the darkest of clouds oh she came totriumph but she remained to talk something in the nature of sense she put herself completely in my hands she does me the honour tointimate that of all her friends i m the most disinterested aftershe had announced to me that lord iffield was utterly committed toher and that for the present i was absolutely the only person inthe secret she arrived at her real business she had had asuspicion of me ever since that day at folkestone when i asked herfor the truth about her eyes the truth is what you and i bothguessed she s in very bad danger but from what cause i who by god s mercy have kept mine knoweverything that can be known about eyes said mrs meldrum she might have kept hers if she had profited by god s mercy ifshe had done in time done years ago what was imperatively orderedher if she hadn t in fine been cursed with the loveliness that wasto make her behaviour a thing of fable she may still keep hersight or what remains of it if she ll sacrifice and after all solittle that purely superficial charm she must do as you ve done she must wear dear lady what you wear what my companion wore glittered for the moment like a melon framein august heaven forgive her now i understand she flushedfor dismay but i wasn t afraid of the effect on her good nature of her thusseeing through her great goggles why it had always been thatflora held her at such a distance i can t tell you i said from what special affection what state of the eye her dangerproceeds that s the one thing she succeeded this morning inkeeping from me she knows it herself perfectly she has had thebest advice in europe it s a thing that s awful simply awful that was the only account she would give me year before last while she was at boulogne she went for three days with mrs floyd taylor to paris she there surreptitiously consulted the greatestman even mrs floyd taylor doesn t know last autumn in germanyshe did the same first put on certain special spectacles with astraight bar in the middle then we ll talk that s practicallywhat they say what she says is that she ll put on anything innature when she s married but that she must get married first she has always meant to do everything as soon as she s married then and then only she ll be safe how will any one ever look ather if she makes herself a fright how could she ever have gotengaged if she had made herself a fright from the first it s nouse to insist that with her beauty she can never be a fright shesaid to me this morning poor girl the most characteristic themost harrowing things my face is all i have and such a face iknew from the first i could do anything with it but i needed itall i need it still every exquisite inch of it it isn t as if ihad a figure or anything else oh if god had only given me afigure too i don t say yes with a figure a really good one like fanny floyd taylor s who s hideous i d have risked plainglasses que voulez vous no one is perfect she says she stillhas money left but i don t believe a word of it she has beenspeculating on her impunity on the idea that her danger would holdoff she has literally been running a race with it her theoryhas been as you from the first so clearly saw that she d get inahead she swears to me that though the bar is too cruel shewears when she s alone what she has been ordered to wear but whenthe deuce is she alone it s herself of course that she hasswindled worst she has put herself off so insanely that even herconceit but half accounts for it with little inadequateconcessions little false measures and preposterous evasions andchildish hopes her great terror is now that iffield who alreadyhas suspicions who has found out her pince nez but whom she hasbeguiled with some unblushing hocus pocus may discover thedreadful facts and the essence of what she wanted this morning wasin that interest to square me to get me to deny indignantly andauthoritatively for isn t she my favourite sitter that she hasanything in life the matter with any part of her she sobbed she went on she entreated after we got talking her extraordinarynerve left her and she showed me what she has been through showedme also all her terror of the harm i could do her wait till i mmarried wait till i m married she took hold of me she almostsank on her knees it seems to me highly immoral one sparticipation in her fraud but there s no doubt that she must bemarried i don t know what i don t see behind it therefore iwound up dawling must keep his hands off mrs meldrum had held her breath she gave out a long moan well that s exactly what i came here to tell him then here he is our host all unprepared his latchkey still inhis hand had just pushed open the door and startled at findingus turned a frightened look from one to the other wondering whatdisaster we were there to announce or avert mrs meldrum was on the spot all gaiety i ve come to return yoursweet visit ah she laughed i mean to keep up theacquaintance do do he murmured mechanically and absently continuing to lookat us then he broke out he s going to marry her i was surprised you already know he produced an evening paper which he tossed down on the table it s in that published already i was still more surprised oh flora can t keep a secret mrs meldrum made it light shewent up to poor dawling and laid a motherly hand upon him it s all right it s just as it ought to be don t think abouther ever any more then as he met this adjuration with a starefrom which thought and of the most defiant and dismal fairlyprotruded the excellent woman put up her funny face and tenderlykissed him on the cheek chapter xi have spoken of these reminiscences as of a row of coloured beads and i confess that as i continue to straighten out my chaplet i amrather proud of the comparison the beads are all there as isaid they slip along the string in their small smooth roundness geoffrey dawling accepted as a gentleman the event his eveningpaper had proclaimed in view of which i snatched a moment to nudgehim a hint that he might offer mrs meldrum his hand he returnedme a heavy head shake and i judged that marriage would henceforthstrike him very much as the traffic of the street may strike somepoor incurable at the window of an hospital circumstances arisingat this time led to my making an absence from england andcircumstances already existing offered him a firm basis for similaraction he had after all the usual resource of a briton he couldtake to his boats always drawn up in our background he startedon a journey round the globe and i was left with nothing but myinference as to what might have happened later observationhowever only confirmed my belief that if at any time during thecouple of months after flora saunt s brilliant engagement he hadmade up as they say to the good lady of folkestone that goodlady would not have pushed him over the cliff strange as she wasto behold i knew of cases in which she had been obliged toadminister that shove i went to new york to paint a couple ofportraits but i found once on the spot that i had countedwithout chicago where i was invited to blot out this harshdiscrimination by the production of some dozen i spent a year inamerica and should probably have spent a second had i not beensummoned back to england by alarming news from my mother herstrength had failed and as soon as i reached london i hurried downto folkestone arriving just at the moment to offer a welcome tosome slight symptom of a rally she had been much worse but wasnow a little better and though i found nothing but satisfaction inhaving come to her i saw after a few hours that my london studio where arrears of work had already met me would be my place toawait whatever might next occur yet before returning to town icalled on mrs meldrum from whom i had not had a line and my viewof whom with the adjacent objects as i had left them had beenintercepted by a luxuriant foreground before i had gained her house i met her as i supposed comingtoward me across the down greeting me from afar with the familiartwinkle of her great vitreous badge and as it was late in theautumn and the esplanade a blank i was free to acknowledge thissignal by cutting a caper on the grass my enthusiasm droppedindeed the next moment for i had seen in a few more seconds thatthe person thus assaulted had by no means the figure of my militaryfriend i felt a shock much greater than any i should have thoughtpossible when on this person s drawing near i knew her for poorlittle flora saunt at what moment she had recognised me belongedto an order of mysteries over which it quickly came home to me one would never linger again once we were face to face it sochiefly mattered that i should succeed in looking entirelyunastonished all i at first saw was the big gold bar crossingeach of her lenses over which something convex and grotesque likethe eyes of a large insect something that now represented herwhole personality seemed as out of the orifice of a prison tostrain forward and press the face had shrunk away it lookedsmaller appeared even to look plain it was at all events so faras the effect on a spectator was concerned wholly sacrificed tothis huge apparatus of sight there was no smile in it and shemade no motion to take my offered hand i had no idea you were down here i said and i wondered whethershe didn t know me at all or knew me only by my voice you thought i was mrs meldrum she ever so quietly answered it was just this low pitch that made me protest with laughter ohyes you have a tremendous deal in common with mrs meldrum i vejust returned to england after a long absence and i m on my way tosee her won t you come with me it struck me that her oldreason for keeping clear of our friend was well disposed of now i ve just left her i m staying with her she stood solemnlyfixing me with her goggles would you like to paint me now sheasked she seemed to speak with intense gravity from behind amask or a cage there was nothing to do but treat the question still with highspirits it would be a fascinating little artistic problem that something was wrong it wasn t difficult to see but a gooddeal more than met the eye might be presumed to be wrong if florawas under mrs meldrum s roof i hadn t for a year had much timeto think of her but my imagination had had ground for lodging herin more gilded halls one of the last things i had heard beforeleaving england was that in commemoration of the new relationshipshe had gone to stay with lady considine this had made me takeeverything else for granted and the noisy american world haddeafened my care to possible contradictions her spectacles wereat present a direct contradiction they seemed a negation not onlyof new relationships but of every old one as well i remembernevertheless that when after a moment she walked beside me on thegrass i found myself nervously hoping she wouldn t as yet at anyrate tell me anything very dreadful so that to stave off thisdanger i harried her with questions about mrs meldrum and withoutwaiting for replies became profuse on the subject of my owndoings my companion was finely silent and i felt both as if shewere watching my nervousness with a sort of sinister irony and asif i were talking to some different and strange person floraplain and obscure and dumb was no flora at all at mrs meldrum sdoor she turned off with the observation that as there wascertainly a great deal i should have to say to our friend she hadbetter not go in with me i looked at her again i had beenkeeping my eyes away from her but only to meet her magnifiedstare i greatly desired in truth to see mrs meldrum alone butthere was something so grim in the girl s trouble that i hesitatedto fall in with this idea of dropping her yet one couldn texpress a compassion without seeming to take for granted moretrouble than there actually might have been i reflected that imust really figure to her as a fool which was an entertainment ihad never expected to give her it rolled over me there for thefirst time it has come back to me since that there is wondrously in very deep and even in very foolish misfortune adignity still finer than in the most inveterate habit of being allright i couldn t have to her the manner of treating it as a meredetail that i was face to face with a part of what at our lastmeeting we had had such a scene about but while i was trying tothink of some manner that i could have she said quite colourlessly though somehow as if she might never see me again good bye i mgoing to take my walk all alone she looked round the great bleak cliff top with whom should igo besides i like to be alone for the present this gave me the glimmer of a vision that she regarded herdisfigurement as temporary and the confidence came to me that shewould never for her happiness cease to be a creature ofillusions it enabled me to exclaim smiling brightly and feelingindeed idiotic oh i shall see you again but i hope you ll havea very pleasant walk all my walks are pleasant thank you they do me such a lot ofgood she was as quiet as a mouse and her words seemed to mestupendous in their wisdom i take several a day she continued she might have been an ancient woman responding with humility atthe church door to the patronage of the parson the more i takethe better i feel i m ordered by the doctors to keep all thewhile in the air and go in for plenty of exercise it keeps up mygeneral health you know and if that goes on improving as it haslately done everything will soon be all right all that was thematter with me before and always it was too reckless was that ineglected my general health it acts directly on the state of theparticular organ so i m going three miles i grinned at her from the doorstep while mrs meldrum s maid stoodthere to admit me oh i m so glad i said looking at her as shepaced away with the pretty flutter she had kept and remembering theday when while she rejoined lord iffield i had indulged in thesame observation her air of assurance was on this occasion notless than it had been on that but i recalled that she had thenstruck me as marching off to her doom was she really now marchingaway from it chapter xias soon as i saw mrs meldrum i of course broke out is thereanything in it is her general health mrs meldrum checked me with her great amused blare you vealready seen her and she has told you her wondrous tale what s in it is what has been in everything she has ever done the mostcomical tragical belief in herself she thinks she s doing a cure and what does her husband think her husband what husband hasn t she then married lord iffield vous en etes le cried my hostess why he behaved like aregular beast how should i know you never wrote me mrs meldrum hesitated covering me with what poor flora called the particular organ no i didn t write you i abstained on purpose if i kept quiet ithought you mightn t hear over there what had happened if youshould hear i was afraid you would stir up mr dawling stir him up urge him to fly to the rescue write out to him that there wasanother chance for him i wouldn t have done it i said well mrs meldrum replied it was not my business to give youan opportunity in short you were afraid of it again she hesitated and though it may have been only my fancy ithought she considerably reddened at all events she laughed out then i was afraid of it she very honestly answered but doesn t he know has he given no sign every sign in life he came straight back to her he dideverything to get her to listen to him but she hasn t the smallestidea of it has he seen her as she is now i presently and just a trifleawkwardly enquired indeed he has and borne it like a hero he told me all aboutit how much you ve all been through i found occasion to remark then what has become of him he s at home in hampshire he has got back his old place and ibelieve by this time his old sisters it s not half a bad littleplace yet its attractions say nothing to flora oh flora s by no means on her back my fried declared she s not on her back because she s on yours have you got herfor the rest of your life once more mrs meldrum genially glared did she tell you how muchthe hammond synges have kindly left her to live on not quiteeighty pounds a year that s a good deal but it won t pay the oculist what was itthat at last induced her to submit to him her general collapse after that brute of an iffield s rupture she cried her eyes out she passed through a horror of blackdarkness then came a gleam of light and the light appears tohave broadened she went into goggles as repentant magdalens gointo the catholic church in spite of which you don t think she ll be saved she thinks she will that s all i can tell you there s no doubtthat when once she brought herself to accept her real remedy asshe calls it she began to enjoy a relief that she had never known that feeling very new and in spite of what she pays for it mostrefreshing has given her something to hold on by begotten in herfoolish little mind a belief that as she says she s on the mendand that in the course of time if she leads a tremendously healthylife she ll be able to take off her muzzle and become as dangerousagain as ever it keeps her going and what keeps you you re good until the parties begin again oh she doesn t object to me now smiled mrs meldrum i m goingto take her abroad we shall be a pretty pair i was struck withthis energy and after a moment i enquired the reason of it it sto divert her mind my friend replied reddening again a little ithought we shall go next week i ve only waited to see how yourmother would be before starting i expressed to her hereupon mysense of her extraordinary merit and also that of theinconceivability of flora s fancying herself still in a situationnot to jump at the chance of marrying a man like dawling shesays he s too ugly she says he s too dreary she says in fact he s nobody mrs meldrum pursued she says above all that he s not her own sort she doesn t deny that he s good but she finds himimpossibly ridiculous he s quite the last person she would everdream of i was almost disposed on hearing this to protest thatif the girl had so little proper feeling her noble suitor hadperhaps served her right but after a while my curiosity as to justhow her noble suitor had served her got the better of that emotion and i asked a question or two which led my companion again to applyto him the invidious term i have already quoted what had happenedwas simply that flora had at the eleventh hour broken down in theattempt to put him off with an uncandid account of her infirmityand that his lordship s interest in her had not been proof againstthe discovery of the way she had practised on him herdissimulation he was obliged to perceive had been infernallydeep the future in short assumed a new complexion for him whenlooked at through the grim glasses of a bride who as he had saidto some one couldn t really when you came to find out see herhand before her face he had conducted himself like any otherjockeyed customer he had returned the animal as unsound he hadbacked out in his own way giving the business by some sharpshuffle such a turn as to make the rupture ostensibly flora s buthe had none the less remorselessly and basely backed out he hadcared for her lovely face cared for it in the amused and hauntedway it had been her poor little delusive gift to make men care andher lovely face damn it with the monstrous gear she had begun torig upon it was just what had let him in he had in the judgmentof his family done everything that could be expected of him he hadmade mrs meldrum had herself seen the letter a handsome offerof pecuniary compensation oh if flora with her incrediblebuoyancy was in a manner on her feet again now it was not that shehad not for weeks and weeks been prone in the dust strange werethe humiliations the forms of anguish it was given some naturesto survive that flora had survived was perhaps after all a proofshe was reserved for some final mercy but she has been in theabysses at any rate said mrs meldrum and i really don t thinki can tell you what pulled her through i think i can tell you i returned what in the world but mrs meldrum at the end of an hour flora had not come in and i was obliged toannounce that i should have but time to reach the station where iwas to find my luggage in charge of my mother s servant mrs meldrum put before me the question of waiting till a later train so as not to lose our young lady but i confess i gave thisalternative a consideration less acute than i pretended somehow ididn t care if i did lose our young lady now that i knew theworst that had befallen her it struck me still less as possible tomeet her on the ground of condolence and with the sad appearanceshe wore to me what other ground was left i lost her but icaught my train in truth she was so changed that one hated to seeit and now that she was in charitable hands one didn t feelcompelled to make great efforts i had studied her face for aparticular beauty i had lived with that beauty and reproduced it but i knew what belonged to my trade well enough to be sure it wasgone for ever chapter xiii was soon called back to folkestone but mrs meldrum and heryoung friend had already left england finding to that end everyconvenience on the spot and not having had to come up to town mythoughts however were so painfully engaged there that i should inany case have had little attention for them the event occurredthat was to bring my series of visits to a close when this hightide had ebbed i returned to america and to my interrupted work which had opened out on such a scale that with a deep plunge intoa great chance i was three good years in rising again to thesurface there are nymphs and naiads moreover in the americandepths they may have had something to do with the duration of mydive i mention them to account for a grave misdemeanor the factthat after the first year i rudely neglected mrs meldrum she hadwritten to me from florence after my mother s death and hadmentioned in a postscript that in our young lady s calculations thelowest figures were now italian counts this was a good omen andif in subsequent letters there was no news of a sequel i wascontent to accept small things and to believe that grave tidings should there be any would come to me in due course the gravityof what might happen to a featherweight became indeed with time anddistance less appreciable and i was not without an impression thatmrs meldrum whose sense of proportion was not the least of hermerits had no idea of boring the world with the ups and downs ofher pensioner the poor girl grew dusky and dim a small fitfulmemory a regret tempered by the comfortable consciousness of howkind mrs meldrum would always be to her i was professionallymore preoccupied than i had ever been and i had swarms of prettyfaces in my eyes and a chorus of loud tones in my ears geoffreydawling had on his return to england written me two or threeletters his last information had been that he was going into thefigures of rural illiteracy i was delighted to receive it and hadno doubt that if he should go into figures they would as they aresaid to be able to prove anything prove at least that my advicewas sound and that he had wasted time enough this quickened on mypart another hope a hope suggested by some roundabout rumour iforget how it reached me that he was engaged to a girl down inhampshire he turned out not to be but i felt sure that if onlyhe went into figures deep enough he would become among the girlsdown in hampshire or elsewhere one of those numerous prizes ofbattle whose defences are practically not on the scale of theirprovocations i nursed in short the thought that it was probablyopen to him to develop as one of the types about whom as the yearsgo on superficial critics wonder without relief how they eversucceeded in dragging a bride to the altar he never alluded toflora saunt and there was in his silence about her quite as inmrs meldrum s an element of instinctive tact a brief implicationthat if you didn t happen to have been in love with her there wasnothing to be said within a week after my return to london i went to the opera ofwhich i had always been much of a devotee i arrived too late forthe first act of lohengrin but the second was just beginning and i gave myself up to it with no more than a glance at the house when it was over i treated myself with my glass from my place inthe stalls to a general survey of the boxes making doubtless ontheir contents the reflections pointed by comparison that aremost familiar to the wanderer restored to london there was thecommon sprinkling of pretty women but i suddenly noted that one ofthese was far prettier than the others this lady alone in one ofthe smaller receptacles of the grand tier and already the aim offifty tentative glasses which she sustained with admirableserenity this single exquisite figure placed in the quarterfurthest removed from my stall was a person i immediately felt to cause one s curiosity to linger dressed in white withdiamonds in her hair and pearls on her neck she had a paleradiance of beauty which even at that distance made her adistinguished presence and with the air that easily attaches tolonely loveliness in public places an agreeable mystery amystery however she remained to me only for a minute after i hadlevelled my glass at her i feel to this moment the startledthrill the shock almost of joy with which i translated her vaguebrightness into a resurrection of flora i say a resurrection because to put it crudely i had on that last occasion left ouryoung woman for dead at present perfectly alive again she wasaltered only as it were by this fact of life a little older alittle quieter a little finer and a good deal fairer she wassimply transfigured by having recovered sustained by thereflection that even her recovery wouldn t enable her todistinguish me in the crowd i was free to look at her well thenit was it came home to me that my vision of her in her greatgoggles had been cruelly final as her beauty was all there was ofher that machinery had extinguished her and so far as i hadthought of her in the interval i had thought of her as buried inthe tomb her stern specialist had built with the sense that shehad escaped from it came a lively wish to return to her and if ididn t straightway leave my place and rush round the theatre and upto her box it was because i was fixed to the spot some momentslonger by the simple inability to cease looking at her she had been from the first of my seeing her practicallymotionless leaning back in her chair with a kind of thoughtfulgrace and with her eyes vaguely directed as it seemed on me toone of the boxes on my side of the house and consequently over myhead and out of my sight the only movement she made for some timewas to finger with an ungloved hand and as if with the habit offondness the row of pearls on her neck which my glass showed me tobe large and splendid her diamonds and pearls in her solitude mystified me making me as she had had no such brave jewels in thedays of the hammond synges wonder what undreamt of improvement hadtaken place in her fortunes the ghost of a question hovered therea moment could anything so prodigious have happened as that onher tested and proved amendment lord iffield had taken her back this could scarce have without my hearing of it and moreover ifshe had become a person of such fashion where was the little courtone would naturally see at her elbow her isolation was puzzling though it could easily suggest that she was but momentarily alone if she had come with mrs meldrum that lady would have takenadvantage of the interval to pay a visit to some other box doubtless the box at which flora had just been looking mrs meldrum didn t account for the jewels but the revival of flora sbeauty accounted for anything she presently moved her eyes overthe house and i felt them brush me again like the wings of a dove i don t know what quick pleasure flickered into the hope that shewould at last see me she did see me she suddenly bent forwardto take up the little double barrelled ivory glass that rested onthe edge of the box and to all appearance fix me with it i smiledfrom my place straight up at the searching lenses and after aninstant she dropped them and smiled as straight back at me oh hersmile it was her old smile her young smile her very own smilemade perfect i instantly left my stall and hurried off for anearer view of it quite flushed i remember as i went with theannoyance of having happened to think of the idiotic way i hadtried to paint her poor iffield with his sample of that error and still poorer dawling in particular with his i hadn t touchedher i was professionally humiliated and as the attendant in thelobby opened her box for me i felt that the very first thing ishould have to say to her would be that she must absolutely sit tome again chapter xiiishe gave me the smile once more as over her shoulder from herchair she turned her face to me here you are again sheexclaimed with her disgloved hand put up a little backward for meto take i dropped into a chair just behind her and having takenit and noted that one of the curtains of the box would make thedemonstration sufficiently private bent my lips over it andimpressed them on its finger tips it was given me however to myastonishment to feel next that all the privacy in the worldcouldn t have sufficed to mitigate the start with which she greetedthis free application of my moustache the blood had jumped to herface she quickly recovered her hand and jerked at me twistingherself round a vacant challenging stare during the next fewinstants several extraordinary things happened the first of whichwas that now i was close to them the eyes of loveliness i had comeup to look into didn t show at all the conscious light i had justbeen pleased to see them flash across the house they showed onthe contrary to my confusion a strange sweet blankness anexpression i failed to give a meaning to until without delay ifelt on my arm directed to it as if instantly to efface the effectof her start the grasp of the hand she had impulsively snatchedfrom me it was the irrepressible question in this grasp thatstopped on my lips all sound of salutation she had mistaken myentrance for that of another person a pair of lips without amoustache she was feeling me to see who i was with theperception of this and of her not seeing me i sat gaping at her andat the wild word that didn t come the right word to express or todisguise my dismay what was the right word to commemorate one ssudden discovery at the very moment too at which one had been mostencouraged to count on better things that one s dear old friendhad gone blind before the answer to this question dropped uponme and the moving moments though few seemed many i heard withthe sound of voices the click of the attendant s key on the otherside of the door poor flora heard also and on hearing still withher hand on my arm brightened again as i had a minute since seenher brighten across the house she had the sense of the return ofthe person she had taken me for the person with the right pair oflips as to whom i was for that matter much more in the dark thanshe i gasped but my word had come if she had lost her sight itwas in this very loss that she had found again her beauty imanaged to speak while we were still alone before her companionhad appeared you re lovelier at this day than you have ever beenin your life at the sound of my voice and that of the opening ofthe door her impatience broke into audible joy she sprang up recognising me always holding me and gleefully cried to agentleman who was arrested in the doorway by the sight of me hehas come back he has come back and you should have heard what hesays of me the gentleman was geoffrey dawling and i thought itbest to let him hear on the spot how beautiful she is my dearman but how extraordinarily beautiful more beautiful at thishour than ever ever before it gave them almost equal pleasure and made dawling blush to hiseyes while this in turn produced in spite of deepenedastonishment a blest snap of the strain i had been strugglingwith i wanted to embrace them both and while the opening bars ofanother scene rose from the orchestra i almost did embrace dawling whose first emotion on beholding me had visibly and ever so oddlybeen a consciousness of guilt i had caught him somehow in theact though that was as yet all i knew but by the time we sanknoiselessly into our chairs again for the music was supreme wagner passed first my demonstration ought pretty well to havegiven him the limit of the criticism he had to fear i myselfindeed while the opera blazed was only too afraid he might divinein our silent closeness the very moral of my optimism which wassimply the comfort i had gathered from seeing that if ourcompanion s beauty lived again her vanity partook of its life ihad hit on the right note that was what eased me off it drew allpain for the next half hour from the sense of the deep darkness inwhich the stricken woman sat if the music in that darkness happily soared and swelled for her it beat its wings in unisonwith those of a gratified passion a great deal came and wentbetween us without profaning the occasion so that i could feel atthe end of twenty minutes as if i knew almost everything he mightin kindness have to tell me knew even why flora while i stared ather from the stalls had misled me by the use of ivory and crystaland by appearing to recognise me and smile she leaned back in herchair in luxurious ease i had from the first become aware thatthe way she fingered her pearls was a sharp image of the weddedstate nothing of old had seemed wanting to her assurance but ihadn t then dreamed of the art with which she would wear thatassurance as a married woman she had taken him when everythinghad failed he had taken her when she herself had done so hisembarrassed eyes confessed it all confessed the deep peace hefound in it they only didn t tell me why he had not written tome nor clear up as yet a minor obscurity flora after a whileagain lifted the glass from the ledge of the box and elegantlyswept the house with it then by the mere instinct of her grace a motion but half conscious she inclined her head into the voidwith the sketch of a salute producing i could see a perfectimitation of response to some homage dawling and i looked at eachother again the tears came into his eyes she was playing atperfection still and her misfortune only simplified the process i recognised that this was as near as i should ever come certainlyas i should come that night to pressing on her misfortune neither of us would name it more than we were doing then and florawould never name it at all little by little i saw that what hadoccurred was strange as it might appear the best thing for herhappiness the question was now only of her beauty and her beingseen and marvelled at with dawling to do for her everything inlife her activity was limited to that such an activity was allwithin her scope it asked nothing of her that she couldn tsplendidly give as from time to time in our delicate communionshe turned her face to me with the parody of a look i lost none ofthe signs of its strange new glory the expression of the eyes wasa rub of pastel from a master s thumb the whole head stamped witha sort of showy suffering had gained a fineness from what she hadpassed through yes flora was settled for life nothing couldhurt her further i foresaw the particular praise she would mostlyincur she would be invariably interesting she would charm withher pathos more even than she had charmed with her pleasure forherself above all she was fixed for ever rescued from all changeand ransomed from all doubt her old certainties her old vanitieswere justified and sanctified and in the darkness that had closedupon her one object remained clear that object as unfading as amosaic mask was fortunately the loveliest she could possibly lookupon the greatest blessing of all was of course that dawlingthought so her future was ruled with the straightest line and sofor that matter was his there were two facts to which before ileft my friends i gave time to sink into my spirit one was thathe had changed by some process as effective as flora s change hadbeen simplified somehow into service as she had been simplifiedinto success he was such a picture of inspired intervention as ihad never yet conceived he would exist henceforth for the solepurpose of rendering unnecessary or rather impossible anyreference even on her own part to his wife s infirmity oh yes how little desire he would ever give me to refer to it heprincipally after a while made me feel and this was my secondlesson that good natured as he was my being there to see it alloppressed him so that by the time the act ended i recognised thati too had filled out my hour dawling remembered things i thinkhe caught in my very face the irony of old judgments they madehim thresh about in his chair i said to flora as i took leave ofher that i would come to see her but i may mention that i neverwent i d go to morrow if i hear she wants me but what in theworld can she ever want as i quitted them i laid my hand ondawling s arm and drew him for a moment into the lobby why did you never write to me of your marriage he smiled uncomfortably showing his long yellow teeth andsomething more i don t know the whole thing gave me such atremendous lot to do this was the first dishonest speech i had heard him make hereally hadn t written because an idea that i would think him astill bigger fool than before i didn t insist but i tried therein the lobby so far as a pressure of his hand could serve me togive him a notion of what i thought him i can t at any rate makeout i said why i didn t hear from mrs meldrum she didn t write to you never a word what has become of her i think she s at folkestone dawling returned but i m sorry tosay that practically she has ceased to see us you haven t quarrelled with her how could we think of all we owe her at the time of ourmarriage and for months before she did everything for us idon t know how we should have managed without her but since thenshe has never been near us and has given us rather markedly littleencouragement to keep up relations with her i was struck with this though of course i admit i am struck withall sorts of things well i said after a moment even if icould imagine a reason for that attitude it wouldn t explain whyshe shouldn t have taken account of my natural interest just so dawling s face was a windowless wall he couldcontribute nothing to the mystery and quitting him i carried itaway it was not till i went down to ace mrs meldrum that wasreally dispelled she didn t want to hear of them or to talk ofthem not a bit and it was just in the same spirit that she hadn twanted to write of them she had done everything in the world forthem but now thank heaven the hard business was over after ihad taken this in which i was quick to do we quite avoided thesubject she simply couldn t bear it the golden bowl volume ihenry james book first the princepart firstithe prince had always liked his london when it had come to him he was one of the modern romans who find by the thames a moreconvincing image of the truth of the ancient state than any theyhave left by the tiber brought up on the legend of the city towhich the world paid tribute he recognised in the present londonmuch more than in contemporary rome the real dimensions of such acase if it was a question of an imperium he said to himself and if one wished as a roman to recover a little the sense ofthat the place to do so was on london bridge or even on a fineafternoon in may at hyde park corner it was not indeed toeither of those places that these grounds of his predilection after all sufficiently vague had at the moment we are concernedwith him guided his steps he had strayed simply enough intobond street where his imagination working at comparativelyshort range caused him now and then to stop before a window inwhich objects massive and lumpish in silver and gold in theforms to which precious stones contribute or in leather steel brass applied to a hundred uses and abuses were as tumbledtogether as if in the insolence of the empire they had been theloot of far off victories the young man s movements however betrayed no consistency of attention not even for that matter when one of his arrests had proceeded from possibilities in facesshaded as they passed him on the pavement by huge beribbonedhats or more delicately tinted still under the tense silk ofparasols held at perverse angles in waiting victorias and theprince s undirected thought was not a little symptomatic since though the turn of the season had come and the flush of thestreets begun to fade the possibilities of faces on the augustafternoon were still one of the notes of the scene he was toorestless that was the fact for any concentration and the lastidea that would just now have occurred to him in any connectionwas the idea of pursuit he had been pursuing for six months as never in his life before and what had actually unsteadied him as we join him was thesense of how he had been justified capture had crowned thepursuit or success as he would otherwise have put it hadrewarded virtue whereby the consciousness of these things madehim for the hour rather serious than gay a sobriety that mighthave consorted with failure sat in his handsome face constructively regular and grave yet at the same time oddly and as might be functionally almost radiant with its dark blueeyes its dark brown moustache and its expression no more sharply foreign to an english view than to have caused it sometimes tobe observed of him with a shallow felicity that he looked like a refined irishman what had happened was that shortly before atthree o clock his fate had practically been sealed and thateven when one pretended to no quarrel with it the moment hadsomething of the grimness of a crunched key in the strongest lockthat could be made there was nothing to do as yet further butfeel what one had done and our personage felt it while heaimlessly wandered it was already as if he were married sodefinitely had the solicitors at three o clock enabled the dateto be fixed and by so few days was that date now distant hewas to dine at half past eight o clock with the young lady onwhose behalf and on whose father s the london lawyers hadreached an inspired harmony with his own man of business poorcalderoni fresh from rome and now apparently in the wondroussituation of being shown london before promptly leaving itagain by mr verver himself mr verver whose easy way with hismillions had taxed to such small purpose in the arrangements the principle of reciprocity the reciprocity with which theprince was during these minutes most struck was that ofcalderoni s bestowal of his company for a view of the lions ifthere was one thing in the world the young man at this juncture clearly intended it was to be much more decent as a son in lawthan lots of fellows he could think of had shown themselves inthat character he thought of these fellows from whom he was soto differ in english he used mentally the english term todescribe his difference for familiar with the tongue from hisearliest years so that no note of strangeness remained with himeither for lip or for ear he found it convenient in life forthe greatest number of relations he found it convenient oddly even for his relation with himself though not unmindful thatthere might still as time went on be others including a moreintimate degree of that one that would seek possibly withviolence the larger or the finer issue which was it of thevernacular miss verver had told him he spoke english too well it was his only fault and he had not been able to speak worseeven to oblige her when i speak worse you see i speakfrench he had said intimating thus that there werediscriminations doubtless of the invidious kind for which thatlanguage was the most apt the girl had taken this she let himknow as a reflection on her own french which she had always sodreamed of making good of making better to say nothing of hisevident feeling that the idiom supposed a cleverness she was nota person to rise to the prince s answer to such remarks genial charming like every answer the parties to his new arrangementhad yet had from him was that he was practising his american inorder to converse properly on equal terms as it were with mr verver his prospective father in law had a command of it hesaid that put him at a disadvantage in any discussion besideswhich well besides which he had made to the girl theobservation that positively of all his observations yet hadmost finely touched her you know i think he s a real galantuomo and no mistake thereare plenty of sham ones about he seems to me simply the best mani ve ever seen in my life well my dear why shouldn t he be the girl had gailyinquired it was this precisely that had set the prince to think thethings or many of them that had made mr verver what he wasseemed practically to bring a charge of waste against the otherthings that with the other people known to the young man hadfailed of such a result why his form he had returned might have made one doubt father s form she hadn t seen it it strikes me he hasn t gotany he hasn t got mine he hasn t even got yours thank you for even the girl had laughed at him oh yours my dear is tremendous but your father has his own i ve madethat out so don t doubt it it s where it has brought him out that s the point it s his goodness that has brought him out our young womanhad at this objected ah darling goodness i think never brought anyone out goodness when it s real precisely rather keeps people in hehad been interested in his discrimination which amused him no it s his way it belongs to him but she had wondered still it s the american way that s all exactly it s all it s all i say it fits him so it must begood for something do you think it would be good for you maggie verver hadsmilingly asked to which his reply had been just of the happiest i don t feel my dear if you really want to know that anything much can noweither hurt me or help me such as i am but you ll see foryourself say however i am a galantuomo which i devoutly hope i m like a chicken at best chopped up and smothered in sauce cooked down as a creme de volaille with half the parts left out your father s the natural fowl running about the bassecour hisfeathers movements his sounds those are the parts that withme are left out all as a matter of course since you can t eat a chickenalive the prince had not been annoyed at this but he had beenpositive well i m eating your father alive which is the onlyway to taste him i want to continue and as it s when he talksamerican that he is most alive so i must also cultivate it toget my pleasure he couldn t make one like him so much in anyother language it mattered little that the girl had continued to demur it wasthe mere play of her joy i think he could make you like him inchinese it would be an unnecessary trouble what i mean is that he s akind of result of his inevitable tone my liking is accordinglyfor the tone which has made him possible oh you ll hear enough of it she laughed before you ve donewith us only this in truth had made him frown a little what do you mean please by my having done with you why found out about us all there is to find he had been able to take it indeed easily as a joke ah love ibegan with that i know enough i feel never to be surprised it s you yourselves meanwhile he continued who really knownothing there are two parts of me yes he had been moved to goon one is made up of the history the doings the marriages the crimes the follies the boundless betises of other people especially of their infamous waste of money that might have cometo me those things are written literally in rows of volumes inlibraries are as public as they re abominable everybody can getat them and you ve both of you wonderfully looked them in theface but there s another part very much smaller doubtless which such as it is represents my single self the unknown unimportant unimportant unimportant save to you personalquantity about this you ve found out nothing luckily my dear the girl had bravely said for what thenwould become please of the promised occupation of my future the young man remembered even now how extraordinarily clear hecouldn t call it anything else she had looked in herprettiness as she had said it he also remembered what he hadbeen moved to reply the happiest reigns we are taught youknow are the reigns without any history oh i m not afraid of history she had been sure of that callit the bad part if you like yours certainly sticks out of you what was it else maggie verver had also said that made meoriginally think of you it wasn t as i should suppose you musthave seen what you call your unknown quantity your particularself it was the generations behind you the follies and thecrimes the plunder and the waste the wicked pope the monstermost of all whom so many of the volumes in your family libraryare all about if i ve read but two or three yet i shall givemyself up but the more as soon as i have time to the rest where therefore she had put it to him again without yourarchives annals infamies would you have been he recalled what to this he had gravely returned i might havebeen in a somewhat better pecuniary situation but his actualsituation under the head in question positively so littlemattered to them that having by that time lived deep into thesense of his advantage he had kept no impression of the girl srejoinder it had but sweetened the waters in which he nowfloated tinted them as by the action of some essence pouredfrom a gold topped phial for making one s bath aromatic no onebefore him never not even the infamous pope had so sat up tohis neck in such a bath it showed for that matter how littleone of his race could escape after all from history what wasit but history and of their kind very much to have theassurance of the enjoyment of more money than the palace builderhimself could have dreamed of this was the element that borehim up and into which maggie scattered on occasion herexquisite colouring drops they were of the colour of what onearth of what but the extraordinary american good faith theywere of the colour of her innocence and yet at the same time ofher imagination with which their relation his and thesepeople s was all suffused what he had further said on theoccasion of which we thus represent him as catching the echoesfrom his own thoughts while he loitered what he had further saidcame back to him for it had been the voice itself of his luck the soothing sound that was always with him you americans arealmost incredibly romantic of course we are that s just what makes everything so nice forus everything he had wondered well everything that s nice at all the world the beautiful world or everything in it that is beautiful i mean we see somuch he had looked at her a moment and he well knew how she hadstruck him in respect to the beautiful world as one of thebeautiful the most beautiful things but what he had answeredwas you see too much that s what may sometimes make youdifficulties when you don t at least he had amended with afurther thought see too little but he had quite granted thathe knew what she meant and his warning perhaps was needless he had seen the follies of the romantic disposition but thereseemed somehow no follies in theirs nothing one was obliged torecognise but innocent pleasures pleasures without penalties their enjoyment was a tribute to others without being a loss tothemselves only the funny thing he had respectfully submitted was that her father though older and wiser and a man into thebargain was as bad that is as good as herself oh he s better the girl had freely declared that is he sworse his relation to the things he cares for and i think itbeautiful is absolutely romantic so is his whole life overhere it s the most romantic thing i know you mean his idea for his native place yes the collection the museum with which he wishes to endowit and of which he thinks more as you know than of anything inthe world it s the work of his life and the motive of everythinghe does the young man in his actual mood could have smiled again smiled delicately as he had then smiled at her has it been hismotive in letting me have you yes my dear positively or in a manner she had said american city isn t by the way his native town for thoughhe s not old it s a young thing compared with him a youngerone he started there he has a feeling about it and the placehas grown as he says like the programme of a charityperformance you re at any rate a part of his collection shehad explained one of the things that can only be got overhere you re a rarity an object of beauty an object of price you re not perhaps absolutely unique but you re so curious andeminent that there are very few others like you you belong to aclass about which everything is known you re what they call amorceau de musee i see i have the great sign of it he had risked that i costa lot of money i haven t the least idea she had gravely answered what youcost and he had quite adored for the moment her way of sayingit he had felt even for the moment vulgar but he had made thebest of that wouldn t you find out if it were a question ofparting with me my value would in that case be estimated she had looked at him with her charming eyes as if his valuewere well before her yes if you mean that i d pay rather thanlose you and then there came again what this had made him say don t talkabout me it s you who are not of this age you re a creature ofa braver and finer one and the cinquecento at its most goldenhour wouldn t have been ashamed of you it would of me and if ididn t know some of the pieces your father has acquired i shouldrather fear for american city the criticism of experts wouldit at all events be your idea he had then just ruefully asked to send me there for safety well we may have to come to it i ll go anywhere you want we must see first it will be only if we have to come to it there are things she had gone on that father puts away thebigger and more cumbrous of course which he stores has alreadystored in masses here and in paris in italy in spain inwarehouses vaults banks safes wonderful secret places we vebeen like a pair of pirates positively stage pirates the sortwho wink at each other and say ha ha when they come to wheretheir treasure is buried ours is buried pretty well everywhere except what we like to see what we travel with and have aboutus these the smaller pieces are the things we take out andarrange as we can to make the hotels we stay at and the houseswe hire a little less ugly of course it s a danger and we haveto keep watch but father loves a fine piece loves as he says the good of it and it s for the company of some of his thingsthat he s willing to run his risks and we ve had extraordinaryluck maggie had made that point we ve never lost anythingyet and the finest objects are often the smallest values inlots of cases you must know have nothing to do with size butthere s nothing however tiny she had wound up that we vemissed i like the class he had laughed for this in which you placeme i shall be one of the little pieces that you unpack at thehotels or at the worst in the hired houses like this wonderfulone and put out with the family photographs and the newmagazines but it s something not to be so big that i have to beburied oh she had returned you shall not be buried my dear tillyou re dead unless indeed you call it burial to go to americancity before i pronounce i should like to see my tomb so he had had after his fashion the last word in their interchange save forthe result of an observation that had risen to his lips at thebeginning which he had then checked and which now came back tohim good bad or indifferent i hope there s one thing youbelieve about me he had sounded solemn even to himself but she had taken itgaily ah don t fix me down to one i believe things enoughabout you my dear to have a few left if most of them even goto smash i ve taken care of that i ve divided my faith intowater tight compartments we must manage not to sink you do believe i m not a hypocrite you recognise that i don tlie or dissemble or deceive is that water tight the question to which he had given a certain intensity had madeher he remembered stare an instant her colour rising as if ithad sounded to her still stranger than he had intended he hadperceived on the spot that any serious discussion of veracity ofloyalty or rather of the want of them practically took herunprepared as if it were quite new to her he had noticed itbefore it was the english the american sign that duplicity like love had to be joked about it couldn t be gone into so the note of his inquiry was well to call it nothing else premature a mistake worth making however for the almostoverdone drollery in which her answer instinctively soughtrefuge water tight the biggest compartment of all why it s the bestcabin and the main deck and the engine room and the steward spantry it s the ship itself it s the whole line it s thecaptain s table and all one s luggage one s reading for thetrip she had images like that that were drawn from steamersand trains from a familiarity with lines a command of own cars from an experience of continents and seas that he wasunable as yet to emulate from vast modern machineries andfacilities whose acquaintance he had still to make but as towhich it was part of the interest of his situation as it stoodthat he could quite without wincing feel his future likely tobristle with them it was in fact content as he was with his engagement andcharming as he thought his affianced bride his view of thatfurniture that mainly constituted our young man s romance andto an extent that made of his inward state a contrast that he wasintelligent enough to feel he was intelligent enough to feelquite humble to wish not to be in the least hard or voracious not to insist on his own side of the bargain to warn himself inshort against arrogance and greed odd enough of a truth washis sense of this last danger which may illustrate moreover hisgeneral attitude toward dangers from within personally heconsidered he hadn t the vices in question and that wasso much to the good his race on the other hand had had themhandsomely enough and he was somehow full of his race itspresence in him was like the consciousness of some inexpugnablescent in which his clothes his whole person his hands and thehair of his head might have been steeped as in some chemicalbath the effect was nowhere in particular yet he constantlyfelt himself at the mercy of the cause he knew his antenatalhistory knew it in every detail and it was a thing to keepcauses well before him what was his frank judgment of so much ofits ugliness he asked himself but a part of the cultivation ofhumility what was this so important step he had just taken butthe desire for some new history that should so far as possible contradict and even if need be flatly dishonour the old ifwhat had come to him wouldn t do he must make somethingdifferent he perfectly recognised always in his humility thatthe material for the making had to be mr verver s millions there was nothing else for him on earth to make it with he hadtried before had had to look about and see the truth humble ashe was at the same time he was not so humble as if he had knownhimself frivolous or stupid he had an idea which may amuse hishistorian that when you were stupid enough to be mistaken aboutsuch a matter you did know it therefore he wasn t mistaken hisfuture might be might be scientific there was nothing inhimself at all events to prevent it he was allying himself toscience for it was science but the absence of prejudice backedby the presence of money his life would be full of machinery which was the antidote to superstition which was in its turn too much the consequence or at least the exhalation ofarchives he thought of these of his not being at all eventsfutile and of his absolute acceptance of the developments of thecoming age to redress the balance of his being so differentlyconsidered the moments when he most winced were those at whichhe found himself believing that really futility would have beenforgiven him even with it in that absurd view he would havebeen good enough such was the laxity in the ververs of theromantic spirit they didn t indeed poor dears know what inthat line the line of futility the real thing meant he did having seen it having tried it having taken its measure thiswas a memory in fact simply to screen out much as just in frontof him while he walked the iron shutter of a shop closing earlyto the stale summer day rattled down at the turn of some crank there was machinery again just as the plate glass all abouthim was money was power the power of the rich peoples well he was of them now of the rich peoples he was on their side ifit wasn t rather the pleasanter way of putting it that they wereon his something of this sort was in any case the moral and the murmurof his walk it would have been ridiculous such a moral fromsuch a source if it hadn t all somehow fitted to the gravity ofthe hour that gravity the oppression of which i began byrecording another feature was the immediate nearness of thearrival of the contingent from home he was to meet them atcharing cross on the morrow his younger brother who had marriedbefore him but whose wife of hebrew race with a portion thathad gilded the pill was not in a condition to travel his sisterand her husband the most anglicised of milanesi his maternaluncle the most shelved of diplomatists and his roman cousin don ottavio the most disponible of ex deputies and ofrelatives a scant handful of the consanguineous who in spite ofmaggie s plea for hymeneal reserve were to accompany him to thealtar it was no great array yet it was apparently to be a morenumerous muster than any possible to the bride herself havingno wealth of kinship to choose from and making it up on theother hand by loose invitations he had been interested in thegirl s attitude on the matter and had wholly deferred to it giving him as it did a glimpse distinctly pleasing of thekind of ruminations she would in general be governed by whichwere quite such as fell in with his own taste they hadn tnatural relations she and her father she had explained so theywouldn t try to supply the place by artificial by make believeones by any searching of highways and hedges oh yes they hadacquaintances enough but a marriage was an intimate thing youasked acquaintances when you had your kith and kin you askedthem over and above but you didn t ask them alone to cover yournudity and look like what they weren t she knew what she meantand what she liked and he was all ready to take from her finding a good omen in both of the facts he expected her desired her to have character his wife should have it and hewasn t afraid of her having much he had had in his earliertime to deal with plenty of people who had had it notably withthe three four ecclesiastics his great uncle the cardinal above all who had taken a hand and played a part in hiseducation the effect of all of which had never been to upsethim he was thus fairly on the look out for the characteristicin this most intimate as she was to come of his associates he encouraged it when it appeared he felt therefore just at present as if his papers were inorder as if his accounts so balanced as they had never done inhis life before and he might close the portfolio with a snap itwould open again doubtless of itself with the arrival of theromans it would even perhaps open with his dining to night inportland place where mr verver had pitched a tent suggestingthat of alexander furnished with the spoils of darius but whatmeanwhile marked his crisis as i have said was his sense of theimmediate two or three hours he paused on corners at crossings there kept rising for him in waves that consciousness sharp asto its source while vague as to its end which i began byspeaking of the consciousness of an appeal to do something orother before it was too late for himself by any friend to whomhe might have mentioned it the appeal could have been turned tofrank derision for what for whom indeed but himself and thehigh advantages attached was he about to marry anextraordinarily charming girl whose prospects of the solidsort were as guaranteed as her amiability he wasn t to do it assuredly all for her the prince as happened however was sofree to feel and yet not to formulate that there rose before himafter a little definitely the image of a friend whom he hadoften found ironic he withheld the tribute of attention frompassing faces only to let his impulse accumulate youth andbeauty made him scarcely turn but the image of mrs assinghammade him presently stop a hansom her youth her beauty werethings more or less of the past but to find her at home as hepossibly might would be doing what he still had time for would put something of a reason into his restlessness and therebyprobably soothe it to recognise the propriety of this particularpilgrimage she lived far enough off in long cadogan place wasalready in fact to work it off a little a perception of thepropriety of formally thanking her and of timing the act just ashe happened to be doing this he made out as he went wasobviously all that had been the matter with him it was true thathe had mistaken the mood of the moment misread it rather superficially as an impulse to look the other way the other wayfrom where his pledges had accumulated mrs assingham precisely represented embodied his pledges was in herpleasant person the force that had set them successively inmotion she had made his marriage quite as truly as his papalancestor had made his family though he could scarce see what shehad made it for unless because she too was perversely romantic he had neither bribed nor persuaded her had given her nothing scarce even till now articulate thanks so that her profit tothink of it vulgarly must have all had to come from the ververs yet he was far he could still remind himself from supposingthat she had been grossly remunerated he was wholly sure shehadn t for if there were people who took presents and people whodidn t she would be quite on the right side and of the proudclass only then on the other hand her disinterestedness wasrather awful it implied that is such abysses of confidence she was admirably attached to maggie whose possession of such afriend might moreover quite rank as one of her assets but thegreat proof of her affection had been in bringing them with herdesign together meeting him during a winter in rome meetinghim afterwards in paris and liking him as she had in timefrankly let him know from the first she had marked him for heryoung friend s own and had then unmistakably presented him in alight but the interest in maggie that was the point would haveachieved but little without her interest in him on what did thatsentiment unsolicited and unrecompensed rest what good again for it was much like his question about mr verver shouldhe ever have done her the prince s notion of a recompense towomen similar in this to his notion of an appeal was more orless to make love to them now he hadn t as he believed madelove the least little bit to mrs assingham nor did he think shehad for a moment supposed it he liked in these days to markthem off the women to whom he hadn t made love it represented and that was what pleased him in it a different stage ofexistence from the time at which he liked to mark off the womento whom he had neither with all this had mrs assinghamherself been either aggressive or resentful on what occasion ever had she appeared to find him wanting these things themotives of such people were obscure a little alarmingly so they contributed to that element of the impenetrable which aloneslightly qualified his sense of his good fortune he rememberedto have read as a boy a wonderful tale by allan poe hisprospective wife s countryman which was a thing to show by theway what imagination americans could have the story of theshipwrecked gordon pym who drifting in a small boat furthertoward the north pole or was it the south than anyone had everdone found at a given moment before him a thickness of white airthat was like a dazzling curtain of light concealing as darknessconceals yet of the colour of milk or of snow there weremoments when he felt his own boat move upon some such mystery the state of mind of his new friends including mrs assinghamherself had resemblances to a great white curtain he had neverknown curtains but as purple even to blackness but as producingwhere they hung a darkness intended and ominous when they wereso disposed as to shelter surprises the surprises were apt to beshocks shocks however from these quite different depths were not whathe saw reason to apprehend what he rather seemed to himself notyet to have measured was something that seeking a name for it he would have called the quantity of confidence reposed in him he had stood still at many a moment of the previous month withthe thought freshly determined or renewed of the generalexpectation to define it roughly of which he was the subject what was singular was that it seemed not so much an expectationof anything in particular as a large bland blank assumption ofmerits almost beyond notation of essential quality and value itwas as if he had been some old embossed coin of a purity of goldno longer used stamped with glorious arms mediaeval wonderful of which the worth in mere modern change sovereigns and halfcrowns would be great enough but as to which since there werefiner ways of using it such taking to pieces was superfluous that was the image for the security in which it was open to himto rest he was to constitute a possession yet was to escapebeing reduced to his component parts what would this mean butthat practically he was never to be tried or tested what wouldit mean but that if they didn t change him they reallywouldn t know he wouldn t know himself how many pounds shillings and pence he had to give these at any rate for thepresent were unanswerable questions all that was before him wasthat he was invested with attributes he was taken seriously lost there in the white mist was the seriousness in them thatmade them so take him it was even in mrs assingham in spite ofher having as she had frequently shown a more mocking spirit all he could say as yet was that he had done nothing so far asto break any charm what should he do if he were to ask herfrankly this afternoon what was morally speaking behind theirveil it would come to asking what they expected him to do shewould answer him probably oh you know it s what we expect youto be on which he would have no resource but to deny hisknowledge would that break the spell his saying he had no idea what idea in fact could he have he also took himself seriously made a point of it but it wasn t simply a question of fancy andpretension his own estimate he saw ways at one time andanother of dealing with but theirs sooner or later say whatthey might would put him to the practical proof as thepractical proof accordingly would naturally be proportionate tothe cluster of his attributes one arrived at a scale that he wasnot honestly the man to calculate who but a billionaire couldsay what was fair exchange for a billion that measure was theshrouded object but he felt really as his cab stopped incadogan place a little nearer the shroud he promised himself virtually to give the latter a twitch ii they re not good days you know he had said to fanny assinghamafter declaring himself grateful for finding her and then withhis cup of tea putting her in possession of the latest news thedocuments signed an hour ago de part et d autre and thetelegram from his backers who had reached paris the morningbefore and who pausing there a little poor dears seemed tothink the whole thing a tremendous lark we re very simple folk mere country cousins compared with you he had also observed and paris for my sister and her husband is the end of theworld london therefore will be more or less another planet ithas always been as with so many of us quite their mecca butthis is their first real caravan they ve mainly known oldengland as a shop for articles in india rubber and leather inwhich they ve dressed themselves as much as possible which allmeans however that you ll see them all of them wreathed insmiles we must be very easy with them maggie s too wonderful her preparations are on a scale she insists on taking in thesposi and my uncle the others will come to me i ve beenengaging their rooms at the hotel and with all those solemnsignatures of an hour ago that brings the case home to me do you mean you re afraid his hostess had amusedly asked terribly afraid i ve now but to wait to see the monster come they re not good days they re neither one thing nor the other i ve really got nothing yet i ve everything to lose one doesn tknow what still may happen the way she laughed at him was for an instant almost irritating it came out for his fancy from behind the white curtain it wasa sign that is of her deep serenity which worried instead ofsoothing him and to be soothed after all to be tided over inhis mystic impatience to be told what he could understand andbelieve that was what he had come for marriage then saidmrs assingham is what you call the monster i admit it s afearful thing at the best but for heaven s sake if that s whatyou re thinking of don t run away from it ah to run away from it would be to run away from you theprince replied and i ve already told you often enough how idepend on you to see me through he so liked the way she tookthis from the corner of her sofa that he gave his sincerity for it was sincerity fuller expression i m starting on thegreat voyage across the unknown sea my ship s all rigged andappointed the cargo s stowed away and the company complete butwhat seems the matter with me is that i can t sail alone my shipmust be one of a pair must have in the waste of waters a whatdo you call it a consort i don t ask you to stay on board withme but i must keep your sail in sight for orientation i don tin the least myself know i assure you the points of thecompass but with a lead i can perfectly follow you must be mylead how can you be sure she asked where i should take you why from your having brought me safely thus far i should neverhave got here without you you ve provided the ship itself and if you ve not quite seen me aboard you ve attended me ever sokindly to the dock your own vessel is all conveniently in thenext berth and you can t desert me now she showed him again her amusement which struck him even asexcessive as if to his surprise he made her also a littlenervous she treated him in fine as if he were not utteringtruths but making pretty figures for her diversion my vessel dear prince she smiled what vessel in the world have i this little house is all our ship bob s and mine andthankful we are now to have it we ve wandered far living asyou may say from hand to mouth without rest for the soles ofour feet but the time has come for us at last to draw in he made at this the young man an indignant protest you talkabout rest it s too selfish when you re just launching me onadventures she shook her head with her kind lucidity not adventures heaven forbid you ve had yours as i ve had mine and my ideahas been all along that we should neither of us begin again myown last precisely has been doing for you all you so prettilymention but it consists simply in having conducted you to rest you talk about ships but they re not the comparison yourtossings are over you re practically in port the port sheconcluded of the golden isles he looked about to put himself more in relation with the place then after an hesitation seemed to speak certain words insteadof certain others oh i know where i am i do decline to beleft but what i came for of course was to thank you if to dayhas seemed for the first time the end of preliminaries i feelhow little there would have been any at all without you thefirst were wholly yours well said mrs assingham they were remarkably easy i veseen them i ve had them she smiled more difficult everything you must feel went of itself so you must feel everything still goes the prince quickly agreed oh beautifully but you had theconception ah prince so had you he looked at her harder a moment you had it first you had itmost she returned his look as if it had made her wonder i liked it if that s what you mean but you liked it surely yourself iprotest that i had easy work with you i had only at last wheni thought it was time to speak for you all that is quite true but you re leaving me all the same you re leaving me you re washing your hands of me he went on however that won t be easy i won t be left and he had turnedhis eyes about again taking in the pretty room that she had justdescribed as her final refuge the place of peace for a world worn couple to which she had lately retired with bob i shallkeep this spot in sight say what you will i shall need you i mnot you know he declared going to give you up for anybody if you re afraid which of course you re not are you trying tomake me the same she asked after a moment he waited a minute too then answered her with a question yousay you liked it your undertaking to make my engagementpossible it remains beautiful for me that you did it s charmingand unforgettable but still more it s mysterious andwonderful why you dear delightful woman did you like it i scarce know what to make she said of such an inquiry ifyou haven t by this time found out yourself what meaning cananything i say have for you don t you really after all feel she added while nothing came from him aren t you consciousevery minute of the perfection of the creature of whom i ve putyou into possession every minute gratefully conscious but that s exactly theground of my question it wasn t only a matter of your handing meover it was a matter of your handing her it was a matter of herfate still more than of mine you thought all the good of herthat one woman can think of another and yet by your account you enjoyed assisting at her risk she had kept her eyes on him while he spoke and this was what visibly determined a repetition for her are you trying tofrighten me ah that s a foolish view i should be too vulgar youapparently can t understand either my good faith or my humility i m awfully humble the young man insisted that s the way i vebeen feeling to day with everything so finished and ready andyou won t take me for serious she continued to face him as if he really troubled her a little oh you deep old italians there you are he returned it s what i wanted you to come to that s the responsible note yes she went on if you re humble you must be dangerous she had a pause while he only smiled then she said i don t inthe least want to lose sight of you but even if i did ishouldn t think it right thank you for that it s what i needed of you i m sure afterall that the more you re with me the more i shall understand it s the only thing in the world i want i m excellent i reallythink all round except that i m stupid i can do pretty wellanything i see but i ve got to see it first and he pursued hisdemonstration i don t in the least mind its having to be shownme in fact i like that better therefore it is that i want thati shall always want your eyes through them i wish to look evenat any risk of their showing me what i mayn t like for then hewound up i shall know and of that i shall never be afraid she might quite have been waiting to see what he would come to but she spoke with a certain impatience what on earth are youtalking about but he could perfectly say of my real honest fear of being off some day of being wrong without knowing it that s what ishall always trust you for to tell me when i am no with youpeople it s a sense we haven t got it not as you have therefore but he had said enough ecco he simply smiled it was not to be concealed that he worked upon her but of courseshe had always liked him i should be interested she presentlyremarked to see some sense you don t possess well he produced one on the spot the moral dear mrs assingham i mean always as you others consider it i ve ofcourse something that in our poor dear backward old romesufficiently passes for it but it s no more like yours than thetortuous stone staircase half ruined into the bargain in somecastle of our quattrocento is like the lightning elevator inone of mr verver s fifteen storey buildings your moral senseworks by steam it sends you up like a rocket ours is slow andsteep and unlighted with so many of the steps missing that well that it s as short in almost any case to turn round andcome down again trusting mrs assingham smiled to get up some other way yes or not to have to get up at all however he added itold you that at the beginning machiavelli she simply exclaimed you do me too much honour i wish indeed i had his genius however if you really believe i have his perversity you wouldn tsay it but it s all right he gaily enough concluded i shallalways have you to come to on this for a little they sat face to face after which without comment she asked him if he would have more tea all shewould give him he promptly signified and he developed makingher laugh his idea that the tea of the english race was somehowtheir morality made with boiling water in a little pot sothat the more of it one drank the more moral one would become his drollery served as a transition and she put to him severalquestions about his sister and the others questions as to whatbob in particular colonel assingham her husband could do forthe arriving gentlemen whom by the prince s leave he wouldimmediately go to see he was funny while they talked abouthis own people too whom he described with anecdotes of theirhabits imitations of their manners and prophecies of theirconduct as more rococo than anything cadogan place would everhave known this mrs assingham professed was exactly whatwould endear them to her and that in turn drew from hervisitor a fresh declaration of all the comfort of his being ableso to depend on her he had been with her at this point sometwenty minutes but he had paid her much longer visits and hestayed now as if to make his attitude prove his appreciation hestayed moreover that was really the sign of the hour in spiteof the nervous unrest that had brought him and that had in truthmuch rather fed on the scepticism by which she had apparentlymeant to soothe it she had not soothed him and there arrived remarkably a moment when the cause of her failure gleamed out he had not frightened her as she called it he felt that yetshe was herself not at ease she had been nervous though tryingto disguise it the sight of him following on the announcementof his name had shown her as disconcerted this conviction forthe young man deepened and sharpened yet with the effect too of making him glad in spite of it it was as if in calling hehad done even better than he intended for it was somehowimportant that was what it was that there should be at thishour something the matter with mrs assingham with whom in alltheir acquaintance so considerable now there had never been theleast little thing the matter to wait thus and watch for it wasto know of a truth that there was something the matter withhim since strangely with so little to go upon his heart hadpositively begun to beat to the tune of suspense it fairlybefell at last for a climax that they almost ceased topretend to pretend that is to cheat each other with forms theunspoken had come up and there was a crisis neither could havesaid how long it lasted during which they were reduced for allinterchange to looking at each other on quite an inordinatescale they might at this moment in their positively portentousstillness have been keeping it up for a wager sitting for theirphotograph or even enacting a tableau vivant the spectator of whom they would thus well have been worthy mighthave read meanings of his own into the intensity of theircommunion or indeed even without meanings have found hisaccount aesthetically in some gratified play of our modernsense of type so scantly to be distinguished from our modernsense of beauty type was there at the worst in mrs assingham s dark neat head on which the crisp black hair madewaves so fine and so numerous that she looked even more in thefashion of the hour than she desired full of discriminationsagainst the obvious she had yet to accept a flagrant appearanceand to make the best of misleading signs her richness of hue her generous nose her eyebrows marked like those of an actress these things with an added amplitude of person on which middleage had set its seal seemed to present her insistently as adaughter of the south or still more of the east a creatureformed by hammocks and divans fed upon sherbets and waited uponby slaves she looked as if her most active effort might be totake up as she lay back her mandolin or to share a sugaredfruit with a pet gazelle she was in fact however neither apampered jewess nor a lazy creole new york had been recordedly her birthplace and europe punctually her discipline she woreyellow and purple because she thought it better as she said while one was about it to look like the queen of sheba than likea revendeuse she put pearls in her hair and crimson and gold inher tea gown for the same reason it was her theory that natureitself had overdressed her and that her only course was to drown as it was hopeless to try to chasten the overdressing so shewas covered and surrounded with things which were frankly toysand shams a part of the amusement with which she rejoiced tosupply her friends these friends were in the game that ofplaying with the disparity between her aspect and her character her character was attested by the second movement of her face which convinced the beholder that her vision of the humours ofthe world was not supine not passive she enjoyed she neededthe warm air of friendship but the eyes of the american citylooked out somehow for the opportunity of it from under thelids of jerusalem with her false indolence in short her falseleisure her false pearls and palms and courts and fountains shewas a person for whom life was multitudinous detail detail thatleft her as it at any moment found her unappalled andunwearied sophisticated as i may appear it was her frequent phrase shehad found sympathy her best resource it gave her plenty to do it made her as she also said sit up she had in her life twogreat holes to fill and she described herself as dropping socialscraps into them as she had known old ladies in her earlyamerican time drop morsels of silk into the baskets in whichthey collected the material for some eventual patchwork quilt one of these gaps in mrs assingham s completeness was her wantof children the other was her want of wealth it was wonderfulhow little either in the fulness of time came to show sympathyand curiosity could render their objects practically filial justas an english husband who in his military years had run everything in his regiment could make economy blossom like therose colonel bob had a few years after his marriage left thearmy which had clearly by that time done its laudable all forthe enrichment of his personal experience and he could thus givehis whole time to the gardening in question there reigned amongthe younger friends of this couple a legend almost too venerablefor historical criticism that the marriage itself the happiestof its class dated from the far twilight of the age a primitiveperiod when such things such things as american girls acceptedas good enough had not begun to be so that the pleasant pairhad been as to the risk taken on either side bold and original honourably marked for the evening of life as discoverers of akind of hymeneal northwest passage mrs assingham knew better knew there had been no historic hour from that of pocahontasdown when some young englishman hadn t precipitately believedand some american girl hadn t with a few more gradations availed herself to the full of her incapacity to doubt but sheaccepted resignedly the laurel of the founder since she was infact pretty well the doyenne above ground of her transplantedtribe and since above all she had invented combinations though she had not invented bob s own it was he who had donethat absolutely puzzled it out by himself from his first oddglimmer resting upon it moreover through the years to come asproof enough in him by itself of the higher cleverness if shekept her own cleverness up it was largely that he should havefull credit there were moments in truth when she privately felthow little striking out as he had done he could have affordedthat she should show the common limits but mrs assingham scleverness was in truth tested when her present visitor at lastsaid to her i don t think you know that you re treating mequite right you ve something on your mind that you don t tellme it was positive too that her smile in reply was a trifle dim am i obliged to tell you everything i have on my mind it isn t a question of everything but it s a question ofanything that may particularly concern me then you shouldn tkeep it back you know with what care i desire to proceed takingeverything into account and making no mistake that may possiblyinjure her mrs assingham at this had after an instant an oddinterrogation her her and him both our friends either maggie or her father i have something on my mind mrs assingham presently returned something has happened for which i hadn t been prepared but itisn t anything that properly concerns you the prince with immediate gaiety threw back his head what doyou mean by properly i somehow see volumes in it it s the waypeople put a thing when they put it well wrong i put thingsright what is it that has happened for me his hostess the next moment had drawn spirit from his tone oh i shall be delighted if you ll take your share of it charlotte stant is in london she has just been here miss stant oh really the prince expressed clear surprise atransparency through which his eyes met his friend s with acertain hardness of concussion she has arrived from america he then quickly asked she appears to have arrived this noon coming up fromsouthampton at an hotel she dropped upon me after luncheon andwas here for more than an hour the young man heard with interest though not with an interesttoo great for his gaiety you think then i ve a share in it what is my share why any you like the one you seemed just now eager to take itwas you yourself who insisted he looked at her on this with conscious inconsistency and shecould now see that he had changed colour but he was always easy i didn t know then what the matter was you didn t think it could be so bad do you call it very bad the young man asked only shesmiled because that s the way it seems to affect you he hesitated still with the trace of his quickened colour stilllooking at her still adjusting his manner but you allowed youwere upset to the extent yes of not having in the least looked for her any more said mrs assingham than i judge maggie to havedone the prince thought then as if glad to be able to say somethingvery natural and true no quite right maggie hasn t looked forher but i m sure he added she ll be delighted to see her that certainly and his hostess spoke with a different shadeof gravity she ll be quite overjoyed the prince went on has miss stantnow gone to her she has gone back to her hotel to bring her things here ican t have her said mrs assingham alone at an hotel no i see if she s here at all she must stay with me he quite took itin so she s coming now i expect her at any moment if you wait you ll see her oh he promptly declared charming but this word came out asif a little in sudden substitution for some other it soundedaccidental whereas he wished to be firm that accordingly waswhat he next showed himself if it wasn t for what s going onthese next days maggie would certainly want to have her infact he lucidly continued isn t what s happening just areason to make her want to mrs assingham for answer onlylooked at him and this the next instant had apparently hadmore effect than if she had spoken for he asked a question thatseemed incongruous what has she come for it made his companion laugh why for just what you say foryour marriage mine he wondered maggie s it s the same thing it s for your great event andthen said mrs assingham she s so lonely has she given you that as a reason i scarcely remember she gave me so many she abounds poordear in reasons but there s one that whatever she does ialways remember for myself and which is that he looked as if he ought to guess butcouldn t why the fact that she has no home absolutely none whatever she s extraordinarily alone again he took it in and also has no great means very small ones which is not however with the expense ofrailways and hotels a reason for her running to and fro on the contrary but she doesn t like her country hers my dear man it s little enough hers the attribution for the moment amused his hostess she has rebounded now butshe has had little enough else to do with it oh i say hers the prince pleasantly explained very much as at this time of day i might say mine i quite feel i assureyou as if the great place already more or less belonged to me that s your good fortune and your point of view you own or yousoon practically will own so much of it charlotte owns almostnothing in the world she tells me but two colossal trunks onlyone of which i have given her leave to introduce into this house she ll depreciate to you mrs assingham added your property he thought of these things he thought of every thing but he hadalways his resource at hand of turning all to the easy has shecome with designs upon me and then in a moment as if even thiswere almost too grave he sounded the note that had least to dowith himself est elle toujours aussi belle that was thefurthest point somehow to which charlotte stant could berelegated mrs assingham treated it freely just the same the person inthe world to my sense whose looks are most subject toappreciation it s all in the way she affects you one admiresher if one doesn t happen not to so as well one criticisesher ah that s not fair said the prince to criticise her then there you are you re answered i m answered he took it humorously as his lesson sank hisprevious self consciousness with excellent effect in gratefuldocility i only meant that there are perhaps better things tobe done with miss stant than to criticise her when once youbegin that with anyone he was vague and kind i quite agree that it s better to keep out of it as long as onecan but when one must do it yes he asked as she paused then know what you mean i see perhaps he smiled i don t know what i mean well it s what just now in all ways you particularly shouldknow mrs assingham however made no more of this having before anything else apparently a scruple about the tone shehad just used i quite understand of course that given hergreat friendship with maggie she should have wanted to bepresent she has acted impulsively but she has actedgenerously she has acted beautifully said the prince i say generously because i mean she hasn t in any way counted the cost she ll have it to count in a manner now hishostess continued but that doesn t matter he could see how little you ll look after her i ll look after her so it s all right it s all right said mrs assingham then why are youtroubled it pulled her up but only for a minute i m not any more thanyou the prince s dark blue eyes were of the finest and on occasion precisely resembled nothing so much as the high windows of aroman palace of an historic front by one of the great olddesigners thrown open on a feast day to the golden air his lookitself at such times suggested an image that of some verynoble personage who expected acclaimed by the crowd in thestreet and with old precious stuffs falling over the sill for hissupport had gaily and gallantly come to show himself alwaysmoreover less in his own interest than in that of spectators andsubjects whose need to admire even to gape was periodically tobe considered the young man s expression became after thisfashion something vivid and concrete a beautiful personalpresence that of a prince in very truth a ruler warrior patron lighting up brave architecture and diffusing the sense ofa function it had been happily said of his face that the figurethus appearing in the great frame was the ghost of some proudestancestor whoever the ancestor now at all events the princewas for mrs assingham s benefit in view of the people heseemed leaning on crimson damask to take in the bright day helooked younger than his years he was beautiful innocent vague oh well i m not he rang out clear i should like to see you sir she said for you wouldn t havea shadow of excuse he showed how he agreed that he would havebeen at a loss for one and the fact of their serenity was thusmade as important as if some danger of its opposite had directlymenaced them the only thing was that if the evidence of theircheer was so established mrs assingham had a little to explainher original manner and she came to this before they dropped thequestion my first impulse is always to behave abouteverything as if i feared complications but i don t fear them i really like them they re quite my element he deferred for her to this account of herself but still he said if we re not in the presence of a complication she hesitated a handsome clever odd girl staying with one isalways a complication the young man weighed it almost as if the question were new tohim and will she stay very long his friend gave a laugh how in the world can i know i vescarcely asked her ah yes you can t but something in the tone of it amused her afresh do you thinkyou could i he wondered do you think you could get it out of her for me the probablelength of her stay he rose bravely enough to the occasion and the challenge idaresay if you were to give me the chance here it is then for you she answered for she had heard within the minute the stop of a cab at her door she s back iiiit had been said as a joke but as after this they awaitedtheir friend in silence the effect of the silence was to turnthe time to gravity a gravity not dissipated even when theprince next spoke he had been thinking the case over and makingup his mind a handsome clever odd girl staying with one was acomplication mrs assingham so far was right but there werethe facts the good relations from schooldays of the two youngwomen and the clear confidence with which one of them hadarrived she can come you know at any time to us mrs assingham took it up with an irony beyond laughter you dlike her for your honeymoon oh no you must keep her for that but why not after she had looked at him a minute then at the sound of a voice inthe corridor they had got up why not you re splendid charlotte stant the next minute was with them ushered in asshe had alighted from her cab and prepared for not finding mrs assingham alone this would have been to be noticed by thebutler s answer on the stairs to a question put to him shecould have looked at her hostess with such straightness andbrightness only from knowing that the prince was also there thediscrimination of but a moment yet which let him take her instill better than if she had instantly faced him he availedhimself of the chance thus given him for he was conscious of allthese things what he accordingly saw for some seconds withintensity was a tall strong charming girl who wore for him atfirst exactly the look of her adventurous situation asuggestion in all her person in motion and gesture in free vivid yet altogether happy indications of dress from thebecoming compactness of her hat to the shade of tan in her shoes of winds and waves and custom houses of far countries and longjourneys the knowledge of how and where and the habit foundedon experience of not being afraid he was aware at the sametime that of this combination the strongminded note was not as might have been apprehended the basis he was nowsufficiently familiar with english speaking types he had soundedattentively enough such possibilities for a quick vision ofdifferences he had besides his own view of this young lady sstrength of mind it was great he had ground to believe but itwould never interfere with the play of her extremely personal her always amusing taste this last was the thing in her for shethrew it out positively on the spot like a light that shemight have reappeared during these moments just to cool hisworried eyes with he saw her in her light that immediate exclusive address to their friend was like a lamp she was holdingaloft for his benefit and for his pleasure it showed himeverything above all her presence in the world so closely soirretrievably contemporaneous with his own a sharp sharp fact sharper during these instants than any other at all even thanthat of his marriage but accompanied in a subordinate andcontrolled way with those others facial physiognomic thatmrs assingham had been speaking of as subject to appreciation so they were these others as he met them again and that wasthe connection they instantly established with him if they hadto be interpreted this made at least for intimacy there was butone way certainly for him to interpret them in the sense of thealready known making use then of clumsy terms of excess the face was toonarrow and too long the eyes not large and the mouth on theother hand by no means small with substance in its lips and aslight the very slightest tendency to protrusion in the solidteeth otherwise indeed well arrayed and flashingly white but itwas strangely as a cluster of possessions of his own that thesethings in charlotte stant now affected him items in a fulllist items recognised each of them as if for the longinterval they had been stored wrapped up numbered put awayin a cabinet while she faced mrs assingham the door of thecabinet had opened of itself he took the relics out one by one and it was more and more each instant as if she were giving himtime he saw again that her thick hair was vulgarly speaking brown but that there was a shade of tawny autumn leaf in it for appreciation a colour indescribable and of which he had knownno other case something that gave her at moments the sylvanhead of a huntress he saw the sleeves of her jacket drawn to herwrists but he again made out the free arms within them to be ofthe completely rounded the polished slimness that florentinesculptors in the great time had loved and of which theapparent firmness is expressed in their old silver and oldbronze he knew her narrow hands he knew her long fingers andthe shape and colour of her finger nails he knew her specialbeauty of movement and line when she turned her back and theperfect working of all her main attachments that of somewonderful finished instrument something intently made forexhibition for a prize he knew above all the extraordinaryfineness of her flexible waist the stem of an expanded flower which gave her a likeness also to some long loose silk purse well filled with gold pieces but having been passed empty through a finger ring that held it together it was as if beforeshe turned to him he had weighed the whole thing in his openpalm and even heard a little the chink of the metal when shedid turn to him it was to recognise with her eyes what he mighthave been doing she made no circumstance of thus coming uponhim save so far as the intelligence in her face could at anymoment make a circumstance of almost anything if when she movedoff she looked like a huntress she looked when she came nearerlike his notion perhaps not wholly correct of a muse but whatshe said was simply you see you re not rid of me how is dearmaggie it was to come soon enough by the quite unforced operation ofchance the young man s opportunity to ask her the questionsuggested by mrs assingham shortly before her entrance thelicense had he chosen to embrace it was within a few minutesall there the license given him literally to inquire of thisyoung lady how long she was likely to be with them for a matterof the mere domestic order had quickly determined on mrs assingham s part a withdrawal of a few moments which had theeffect of leaving her visitors free mrs betterman s there she had said to charlotte in allusion to some member of thehousehold who was to have received her and seen her belongingssettled to which charlotte had replied that she had encounteredonly the butler who had been quite charming she had deprecatedany action taken on behalf of her effects but her hostess rebounding from accumulated cushions evidently saw more in mrs betterman s non appearance than could meet the casual eye whatshe saw in short demanded her intervention in spite of anearnest let me go from the girl and a prolonged smiling wailover the trouble she was giving the prince was quite aware atthis moment that departure for himself was indicated thequestion of miss stant s installation didn t demand his presence it was a case for one to go away if one hadn t a reason forstaying he had a reason however of that he was equally aware and he had not for a good while done anything more conscious andintentional than not quickly to take leave his visibleinsistence for it came to that even demanded of him a certaindisagreeable effort the sort of effort he had mostly associatedwith acting for an idea his idea was there his idea was to findout something something he wanted much to know and to find itout not tomorrow not at some future time not in short withwaiting and wondering but if possible before quitting the place this particular curiosity moreover confounded itself a littlewith the occasion offered him to satisfy mrs assingham s own hewouldn t have admitted that he was staying to ask a rudequestion there was distinctly nothing rude in his having hisreasons it would be rude for that matter to turn one s back without a word or two on an old friend well as it came to pass he got the word or two for mrs assingham s preoccupation was practically simplifying the littlecrisis was of shorter duration than our account of it duration naturally would have forced him to take up his hat he wassomehow glad on finding himself alone with charlotte that hehad not been guilty of that inconsequence not to be flurried wasthe kind of consistency he wanted just as consistency was thekind of dignity and why couldn t he have dignity when he had somuch of the good conscience as it were on which such advantagesrested he had done nothing he oughtn t he had in fact donenothing at all once more as a man conscious of having knownmany women he could assist as he would have called it at therecurrent the predestined phenomenon the thing always ascertain as sunrise or the coming round of saints days the doingby the woman of the thing that gave her away she did it ever inevitably infallibly she couldn t possibly not do it it washer nature it was her life and the man could always expect itwithout lifting a finger this was his the man s any man s position and strength that he had necessarily the advantage that he only had to wait with a decent patience to be placed in spite of himself it might really be said in the right justso the punctuality of performance on the part of the othercreature was her weakness and her deep misfortune not less nodoubt than her beauty it produced for the man thatextraordinary mixture of pity and profit in which his relationwith her when he was not a mere brute mainly consisted andgave him in fact his most pertinent ground of being always niceto her nice about her nice for her she always dressed her actup of course she muffled and disguised and arranged it showingin fact in these dissimulations a cleverness equal to but onething in the world equal to her abjection she would let it beknown for anything for everything but the truth of which it wasmade that was what precisely charlotte stant would be doingnow that was the present motive and support to a certainty ofeach of her looks and motions she was the twentieth woman shewas possessed by her doom but her doom was also to arrangeappearances and what now concerned him was to learn how sheproposed he would help her would arrange with her to any pointin reason the only thing was to know what appearance could bestbe produced and best be preserved produced and preserved on herpart of course since on his own there had been luckily no follyto cover up nothing but a perfect accord between conduct andobligation they stood there together at all events when the door hadclosed behind their friend with a conscious strained smile andvery much as if each waited for the other to strike the note orgive the pitch the young man held himself in his silentsuspense only not more afraid because he felt her own fear shewas afraid of herself however whereas to his gain of lucidity he was afraid only of her would she throw herself into his arms or would she be otherwise wonderful she would see what he woulddo so their queer minute without words told him and she wouldact accordingly but what could he do but just let her see thathe would make anything everything for her as honourably easyas possible even if she should throw herself into his arms hewould make that easy easy that is to overlook to ignore notto remember and not by the same token either to regret thiswas not what in fact happened though it was also not at a singletouch but by the finest gradations that his tension subsided it s too delightful to be back she said at last and it wasall she definitely gave him being moreover nothing but whatanyone else might have said yet with two or three other thingsthat on his response followed it it quite pointed the path while the tone of it and her whole attitude were as far removedas need have been from the truth of her situation the abjectionthat was present to him as of the essence quite failed to peepout and he soon enough saw that if she was arranging she couldbe trusted to arrange good it was all he asked and all themore that he could admire and like her for it the particular appearance she would as they said go in for wasthat of having no account whatever to give him it would be infact that of having none to give anybody of reasons or ofmotives of comings or of goings she was a charming young womanwho had met him before but she was also a charming young womanwith a life of her own she would take it high up up up everso high well then he would do the same no height would be toogreat for them not even the dizziest conceivable to a youngperson so subtle the dizziest seemed indeed attained when afteranother moment she came as near as she was to come to an apologyfor her abruptness i ve been thinking of maggie and at last i yearned for her iwanted to see her happy and it doesn t strike me i find you tooshy to tell me i shall of course she s happy thank god only it s almost terrible youknow the happiness of young good generous creatures it ratherfrightens one but the blessed virgin and all the saints saidthe prince have her in their keeping certainly they have she s the dearest of the dear but ineedn t tell you the girl added ah he returned with gravity i feel that i ve still much tolearn about her to which he subjoined she ll rejoice awfullyin your being with us oh you don t need me charlotte smiled it s her hour it s agreat hour one has seen often enough with girls what it is but that she said is exactly why why i ve wanted i mean not to miss it he bent on her a kind comprehending face you mustn t missanything he had got it the pitch and he could keep it now for all he had needed was to have it given him the pitch was thehappiness of his wife that was to be the sight of that happinessas a joy for an old friend it was yes magnificent and not theless so for its coming to him suddenly as sincere as noblyexalted something in charlotte s eyes seemed to tell him this seemed to plead with him in advance as to what he was to find init he was eager and he tried to show her that too to find whatshe liked mindful as he easily could be of what the friendshiphad been for maggie it had been armed with the wings of youngimagination young generosity it had been he believed alwayscounting out her intense devotion to her father the liveliestemotion she had known before the dawn of the sentiment inspiredby himself she had not to his knowledge invited the object ofit to their wedding had not thought of proposing to her for amatter of a couple of hours an arduous and expensive journey but she had kept her connected and informed from week to week in spite of preparations and absorptions oh i ve been writingto charlotte i wish you knew her better he could still hear from recent weeks this record of the fact just as he couldstill be conscious not otherwise than queerly of the gratuitouselement in maggie s wish which he had failed as yet to indicateto her older and perhaps more intelligent at any rate whyshouldn t charlotte respond and be quite free to respond tosuch fidelities with something more than mere formal goodmanners the relations of women with each other were of thestrangest it was true and he probably wouldn t have trustedhere a young person of his own race he was proceeding throughouton the ground of the immense difference difficult indeed as itmight have been to disembroil in this young person her race quality nothing in her definitely placed her she was a rare aspecial product her singleness her solitude her want of means that is her want of ramifications and other advantages contributed to enrich her somehow with an odd preciousneutrality to constitute for her so detached yet so aware asort of small social capital it was the only one she had it wasthe only one a lonely gregarious girl could have since few surely had in anything like the same degree arrived at it andsince this one indeed had compassed it but through the play ofsome gift of nature to which you could scarce give a definitename it wasn t a question of her strange sense for tongues with whichshe juggled as a conjuror at a show juggled with balls or hoopsor lighted brands it wasn t at least entirely that for he hadknown people almost as polyglot whom their accomplishment hadquite failed to make interesting he was polyglot himself forthat matter as was the case too with so many of his friends andrelations for none of whom more than for himself was itanything but a common convenience the point was that in thisyoung woman it was a beauty in itself and almost a mystery so certainly he had more than once felt in noting on her lips that rarest among the barbarians of all civil graces a perfectfelicity in the use of italian he had known strangers a few and mostly men who spoke his own language agreeably but he hadknown neither man nor woman who showed for it charlotte s almostmystifying instinct he remembered how from the first of theiracquaintance she had made no display of it quite as if english between them his english so matching with hers were theirinevitable medium he had perceived all by accident by hearingher talk before him to somebody else that they had an alternativeas good an alternative in fact as much better as the amusementfor him was greater in watching her for the slips that nevercame her account of the mystery didn t suffice her recall ofher birth in florence and florentine childhood her parents fromthe great country but themselves already of a corruptgeneration demoralised falsified polyglot well before her with the tuscan balia who was her first remembrance the servantsof the villa the dear contadini of the poder the little girlsand the other peasants of the next podere all the rather shabbybut still ever so pretty human furniture of her early time including the good sisters of the poor convent of the tuscanhills the convent shabbier than almost anything else butprettier too in which she had been kept at school till thesubsequent phase the phase of the much grander institution inparis at which maggie was to arrive terribly frightened and asa smaller girl three years before her own ending of her periodof five such reminiscences naturally gave a ground but theyhad not prevented him from insisting that some strictly civilancestor generations back and from the tuscan hills if shewould made himself felt ineffaceably in her blood and in hertone she knew nothing of the ancestor but she had taken histheory from him gracefully enough as one of the little presentsthat make friendship flourish these matters however all meltedtogether now though a sense of them was doubtless concerned notunnaturally in the next thing of the nature of a surmise thathis discretion let him articulate you haven t i rathergather particularly liked your country they would stick forthe time to their english it doesn t i fear seem particularly mine and it doesn t inthe least matter over there whether one likes it or not thatis to anyone but one s self but i didn t like it saidcharlotte stant that s not encouraging then to me is it the prince went on do you mean because you re going oh yes of course we re going i ve wanted immensely to go she hesitated but now immediately in a month or two it seems to be the new idea on which therewas something in her face as he imagined that made him say didn t maggie write to you not of your going at once but of course you must go and ofcourse you must stay charlotte was easily clear as long aspossible is that what you did he laughed you stayed as long aspossible well it seemed to me so but i hadn t interests you ll havethem on a great scale it s the country for interests saidcharlotte if i had only had a few i doubtless wouldn t haveleft it he waited an instant they were still on their feet yours thenare rather here oh mine the girl smiled they take up little room whereverthey are it determined in him the way this came from her and what itsomehow did for her it determined in him a speech that would haveseemed a few minutes before precarious and in questionable taste the lead she had given him made the difference and he felt it asreally a lift on finding an honest and natural word rise by itslicense to his lips nothing surely could be for both of them more in the note of a high bravery i ve been thinking it allthe while so probable you know that you would have seen yourway to marrying she looked at him an instant and just for these seconds hefeared for what he might have spoiled to marrying whom why some good kind clever rich american again his security hung in the balance then she was as he felt admirable i tried everyone i came across i did my best i showed i hadcome quite publicly for that perhaps i showed it too much atany rate it was no use i had to recognise it no one would haveme then she seemed to show as sorry for his having to hear ofher anything so disconcerting she pitied his feeling about it if he was disappointed she would cheer him up existence youknow all the same doesn t depend on that i mean she smiled on having caught a husband oh existence the prince vaguely commented you think i oughtto argue for more than mere existence she asked i don t seewhy my existence even reduced as much as you like to beingmerely mine should be so impossible there are things of sorts i should be able to have things i should be able to be theposition of a single woman to day is very favourable you know favourable to what why just to existence which may contain after all in one wayand another so much it may contain at the worst evenaffections affections in fact quite particularly fixed thatis on one s friends i m extremely fond of maggie for instance i quite adore her how could i adore her more if i were marriedto one of the people you speak of the prince gave a laugh you might adore him more ah but it isn t is it she asked a question of that my dear friend he returned it s always a question of doingthe best for one s self one can without injury to others hefelt by this time that they were indeed on an excellent basis sohe went on again as if to show frankly his sense of itsfirmness i venture therefore to repeat my hope that you llmarry some capital fellow and also to repeat my belief that sucha marriage will be more favourable to you as you call it thaneven the spirit of the age she looked at him at first only for answer and would haveappeared to take it with meekness had she not perhaps appeared alittle more to take it with gaiety thank you very much shesimply said but at that moment their friend was with them again it was undeniable that as she came in mrs assingham looked with a certain smiling sharpness from one of them to the other the perception of which was perhaps what led charlotte forreassurance to pass the question on the prince hopes so much ishall still marry some good person whether it worked for mrs assingham or not the prince washimself at this more than ever reassured he was safe in aword that was what it all meant and he had required to be safe he was really safe enough for almost any joke it s only heexplained to their hostess because of what miss stant has beentelling me don t we want to keep up her courage if the jokewas broad he had at least not begun it not that is as a joke which was what his companion s address to their friend made ofit she has been trying in america she says but hasn t broughtit off the tone was somehow not what mrs assingham had expected butshe made the best of it well then she replied to the youngman if you take such an interest you must bring it off and you must help dear charlotte said unperturbed as you vehelped so beautifully in such things before with which before mrs assingham could meet the appeal she had addressedherself to the prince on a matter much nearer to him your mar riage is on friday on saturday oh on friday no for what do you take us there s not a vulgaromen we re neglecting on saturday please at the oratory atthree o clock before twelve assistants exactly twelve including me it struck him he laughed you ll make the thirteenth it won tdo not said charlotte if you re going in for omens shouldyou like me to stay away dear no we ll manage we ll make the round number we ll havein some old woman they must keep them there for that don tthey mrs assingham s return had at last indicated for him hisdeparture he had possessed himself again of his hat andapproached her to take leave but he had another word forcharlotte i dine to night with mr verver have you anymessage the girl seemed to wonder a little for mr verver for maggie about her seeing you early that i know is whatshe ll like then i ll come early thanks i daresay he went on she ll send for you i mean send acarriage oh i don t require that thanks i can go for a penny can ti she asked of mrs assingham in an omnibus oh i say said the prince while mrs assingham looked at herblandly yes love and i ll give you the penny she shall get there the good lady added to their friend but charlotte as the latter took leave of her thought ofsomething else there s a great favour prince that i want toask of you i want between this and saturday to make maggie amarriage present oh i say the young man again soothingly exclaimed ah but i must she went on it s really almost for that icame back it was impossible to get in america what i wanted mrs assingham showed anxiety what is it then dear you want but the girl looked only at their companion that s what theprince if he ll be so good must help me to decide can t i mrs assingham asked help you to decide certainly darling we must talk it well over and she kept hereyes on the prince but i want him if he kindly will to go withme to look i want him to judge with me and choose that if youcan spare the hour she said is the great favour i mean he raised his eyebrows at her he wonderfully smiled what youcame back from america to ask ah certainly then i must findthe hour he wonderfully smiled but it was rather more afterall than he had been reckoning with it went somehow so littlewith the rest that directly for him it wasn t the note ofsafety it preserved this character at the best but by beingthe note of publicity quickly quickly however the note ofpublicity struck him as better than any other in another momenteven it seemed positively what he wanted for what so much aspublicity put their relation on the right footing by this appealto mrs assingham it was established as right and sheimmediately showed that such was her own understanding certainly prince she laughed you must find the hour andit was really so express a license from her as representingfriendly judgment public opinion the moral law the marginallowed a husband about to be or whatever that after observingto charlotte that should she come to portland place in the morn ing he would make a point of being there to see her and so easily arrange with her about a time he took his departure withthe absolutely confirmed impression of knowing as he put it tohimself where he was which was what he had prolonged his visitfor he was where he could stay iv i don t quite see my dear colonel assingham said to his wifethe night of charlotte s arrival i don t quite see i m boundto say why you take it even at the worst so ferociously hard it isn t your fault after all is it i ll be hanged at anyrate if it s mine the hour was late and the young lady who had disembarked atsouthampton that morning to come up by the steamer special andwho had then settled herself at an hotel only to re settleherself a couple of hours later at a private house was by thistime they might hope peacefully resting from her exploits there had been two men at dinner rather batteredbrothers in arms of his own period casually picked up by herhost the day before and when the gentlemen after the meal rejoined the ladies in the drawing room charlotte pleadingfatigue had already excused herself the beguiled warriors however had stayed till after eleven mrs assingham thoughfinally quite without illusions as she said about the militarycharacter was always beguiling to old soldiers and as thecolonel had come in before dinner only in time to dress he hadnot till this moment really been summoned to meet his companionover the situation that as he was now to learn their visitor sadvent had created for them it was actually more than midnight the servants had been sent to bed the rattle of the wheels hadceased to come in through a window still open to the august air and robert assingham had been steadily learning all the while what it thus behoved him to know but the words just quoted fromhim presented themselves for the moment as the essence of hisspirit and his attitude he disengaged he would be damned if hedidn t they were both phrases he repeatedly used hisresponsibility the simplest the sanest the most obliging ofmen he habitually indulged in extravagant language his wife hadonce told him in relation to his violence of speech that suchexcesses on his part made her think of a retired general whomshe had once seen playing with toy soldiers fighting and winningbattles carrying on sieges and annihilating enemies with littlefortresses of wood and little armies of tin her husband sexaggerated emphasis was his box of toy soldiers his militarygame it harmlessly gratified in him for his declining years the military instinct bad words when sufficiently numerous andarrayed in their might could represent battalions squadrons tremendous cannonades and glorious charges of cavalry it wasnatural it was delightful the romance and for her as well ofcamp life and of the perpetual booming of guns it was fightingto the end to the death but no one was ever killed less fortunate than she nevertheless in spite of his wealth ofexpression he had not yet found the image that described herfavourite game all he could do was practically to leave it toher emulating her own philosophy he had again and again sat uplate to discuss those situations in which her finer consciousnessabounded but he had never failed to deny that anything in life anything of hers could be a situation for himself she might bein fifty at once if she liked and it was what women did like attheir ease after all there always being when they had too muchof any some man as they were well aware to get them out hewouldn t at any price have one of any sort whatever of hisown or even be in one along with her he watched her accordingly in her favourite element very much as he hadsometimes watched at the aquarium the celebrated lady who in aslight though tight bathing suit turned somersaults and didtricks in the tank of water which looked so cold anduncomfortable to the non amphibious he listened to his companionto night while he smoked his last pipe he watched her throughher demonstration quite as if he had paid a shilling but it wastrue that this being the case he desired the value of hismoney what was it in the name of wonder that she was so benton being responsible for what did she pretend was going tohappen and what at the worst could the poor girl do evengranting she wanted to do anything what at the worst for thatmatter could she be conceived to have in her head if she had told me the moment she got here mrs assinghamreplied i shouldn t have my difficulty in finding out but shewasn t so obliging and i see no sign at all of her becoming so what s certain is that she didn t come for nothing she wants she worked it out at her leisure to see the prince again thatisn t what troubles me i mean that such a fact as a fact isn t but what i ask myself is what does she want it for what s the good of asking yourself if you know you don t know the colonel sat back at his own ease with an ankle resting onthe other knee and his eyes attentive to the good appearance ofan extremely slender foot which he kept jerking in its neatintegument of fine spun black silk and patent leather it seemedto confess this member to consciousness of military discipline everything about it being as polished and perfect as straightand tight and trim as a soldier on parade it went so far as toimply that someone or other would have got something or other confinement to barracks or suppression of pay if it hadn t beenjust as it was bob assingham was distinguished altogether by aleanness of person a leanness quite distinct from physicallaxity which might have been determined on the part of superiorpowers by views of transport and accommodation and which infact verged on the abnormal he did himself as well as hisfriends mostly knew yet remained hungrily thin with facial with abdominal cavities quite grim in their effect and with aconsequent looseness of apparel that combined with a choice ofqueer light shades and of strange straw like textures of theaspect of chinese mats provocative of wonder at his sources ofsupply suggested the habit of tropic islands a continualcane bottomed chair a governorship exercised on wide verandahs his smooth round head with the particular shade of its whitehair was like a silver pot reversed his cheekbones and thebristle of his moustache were worthy of attila the hun thehollows of his eyes were deep and darksome but the eyes withinthem were like little blue flowers plucked that morning he kneweverything that could be known about life which he regarded as for far the greater part a matter of pecuniary arrangement hiswife accused him of a want alike of moral and of intellectualreaction or rather indeed of a complete incapacity for either he never went even so far as to understand what she meant and itdidn t at all matter since he could be in spite of thelimitation a perfectly social creature the infirmities thepredicaments of men neither surprised nor shocked him andindeed which was perhaps his only real loss in a thrifty career scarce even amused he took them for granted without horror classifying them after their kind and calculating results andchances he might in old bewildering climates in old campaignsof cruelty and license have had such revelations and known suchamazements that he had nothing more to learn but he was whollycontent in spite of his fondness in domestic discussion forthe superlative degree and his kindness in the oddest way seemed to have nothing to do with his experience he could dealwith things perfectly for all his needs without getting nearthem this was the way he dealt with his wife a large proportion ofwhose meanings he knew he could neglect he edited for theirgeneral economy the play of her mind just as he edited savingly with the stump of a pencil her redundant telegrams the thing in the world that was least of a mystery to him was hisclub which he was accepted as perhaps too completely managing and which he managed on lines of perfect penetration hisconnection with it was really a master piece of editing this wasin fact to come back very much the process he might have beenproposing to apply to mrs assingham s view of what was nowbefore them that is to their connection with charlotte stant spossibilities they wouldn t lavish on them all their littlefortune of curiosity and alarm certainly they wouldn t spendtheir cherished savings so early in the day he liked charlotte moreover who was a smooth and compact inmate and whom he feltas with her instincts that made against waste much more of hisown sort than his wife he could talk with her about fanny almostbetter than he could talk with fanny about charlotte however hemade at present the best of the latter necessity even to thepressing of the question he has been noted as having lastuttered if you can t think what to be afraid of wait till youcan think then you ll do it much better or otherwise if that swaiting too long find out from her don t try to find out fromme ask her herself mrs assingham denied as we know that her husband had a play ofmind so that she could on her side treat these remarks only asif they had been senseless physical gestures or nervous facialmovements she overlooked them as from habit and kindness yetthere was no one to whom she talked so persistently of suchintimate things it s her friendship with maggie that s theimmense complication because that she audibly mused is sonatural then why can t she have come out for it she came out mrs assingham continued to meditate becauseshe hates america there was no place for her there she didn tfit in she wasn t in sympathy no more were the people she saw then it s hideously dear she can t on her means begin to livethere not at all as she can in a way here in the way you mean of living with us of living with anyone she can t live by visits alone and shedoesn t want to she s too good for it even if she could butshe will she must sooner or later stay with them maggie willwant her maggie will make her besides she ll want to herself then why won t that do the colonel asked for you to thinkit s what she has come for how will it do how she went on as without hearing him that s what one keeps feeling why shouldn t it do beautifully that anything of the past she brooded should come back now how will it do how will it do it will do i daresay without your wringing your hands over it when my dear the colonel pursued as he smoked have you everseen anything of yours anything that you ve done not do ah i didn t do this it brought her answer straight i didn tbring her back did you expect her to stay over there all her days to obligeyou not a bit for i shouldn t have minded her coming after theirmarriage it s her coming this way before to which she addedwith inconsequence i m too sorry for her of course she can tenjoy it but i don t see what perversity rides her she needn thave looked it all so in the face as she doesn t do it isuppose simply for discipline it s almost that s the bore ofit discipline to me perhaps then said bob assingham that s what has been heridea take it for god s sake as discipline to you and have donewith it it will do he added for discipline to me as well she was far however from having done with it it was asituation with such different sides as she said and to none ofwhich one could in justice be blind it isn t in the least you know for instance that i believe she s bad never never mrs assingham declared i don t think that of her then why isn t that enough nothing was enough mrs assingham signified but that she shoulddevelop her thought she doesn t deliberately intend shedoesn t consciously wish the least complication it s perfectlytrue that she thinks maggie a dear as who doesn t she sincapable of any plan to hurt a hair of her head yet here sheis and there they are she wound up her husband again for a little smoked in silence what in theworld between them ever took place between charlotte and the prince why nothing except theirhaving to recognise that nothing could that was their littleromance it was even their little tragedy but what the deuce did they do do they fell in love with each other but seeing it wasn tpossible gave each other up then where was the romance why in their frustration in their having the courage to lookthe facts in the face what facts the colonel went on well to begin with that of their neither of them having themeans to marry if she had had even a little a little i mean for two i believe he would bravely have done it after which as her husband but emitted an odd vague sound she correctedherself i mean if he himself had had only a little or a littlemore than a little a little for a prince they would have donewhat they could she did them justice if there had been a way but there wasn t a way and charlotte quite to her honour iconsider understood it he had to have money it was a questionof life and death it wouldn t have been a bit amusing either to marry him as a pauper i mean leaving him one that was whatshe had as he had the reason to see and their reason is what you call their romance she looked at him a moment what do you want more didn t he the colonel inquired want anything more ordidn t for that matter poor charlotte herself she kept her eyes on him there was a manner in it that halfanswered they were thoroughly in love she might have beenhis she checked herself she even for a minute lost herself she might have been anything she liked except his wife but she wasn t said the colonel very smokingly she wasn t mrs assingham echoed the echo not loud but deep filled for a little the room heseemed to listen to it die away then he began again how areyou sure she waited before saying but when she spoke it was definite there wasn t time he had a small laugh for her reason he might have expected someother does it take so much time she herself however remained serious it takes more than theyhad he was detached but he wondered what was the matter with theirtime after which as remembering it all living it over andpiecing it together she only considered you mean that you camein with your idea he demanded it brought her quickly to the point and as if also in a measureto answer herself not a bit of it then but you surelyrecall she went on the way a year ago everything tookplace they had parted before he had ever heard of maggie why hadn t he heard of her from charlotte herself because she had never spoken of her is that also the colonel inquired what she has told you i m not speaking his wife returned of what she has told me that s one thing i m speaking of what i know by myself that sanother you feel in other words that she lies to you bob assinghammore sociably asked she neglected the question treating it as gross she never somuch at the time as named maggie it was so positive that it appeared to strike him it s he thenwho has told you she after a moment admitted it it s he and he doesn t lie no to do him justice i believe he absolutely doesn t if ihadn t believed it mrs assingham declared for her generaljustification i would have had nothing to do with him that isin this connection he s a gentleman i mean all as much of oneas he ought to be and he had nothing to gain that helps sheadded even a gentleman it was i who named maggie to him ayear from last may he had never heard of her before then it s grave said the colonel she hesitated do you mean grave for me oh that everything s grave for you is what we take forgranted and are fundamentally talking about it s grave it was for charlotte and it s grave for maggie that is it was when hedid see her or when she did see him you don t torment me as much as you would like she presentlywent on because you think of nothing that i haven t a thousandtimes thought of and because i think of everything that younever will it would all she recognised have been grave if ithadn t all been right you can t make out she contended thatwe got to rome before the end of february he more than agreed there s nothing in life my dear that ican make out well there was nothing in life apparently that she at realneed couldn t charlotte who had been there that year fromearly quite from november left suddenly you ll quite remember about the th of april she was to have stayed on she was tohave stayed naturally more or less for us and she was to havestayed all the more that the ververs due all winter butdelayed week after week in paris were at last really coming they were coming that is maggie was largely to see her andabove all to be with her there it was all altered bycharlotte s going to florence she went from one day to theother you forget everything she gave her reasons but i thoughtit odd at the time i had a sense that something must havehappened the difficulty was that though i knew a little ididn t know enough i didn t know her relation with him had been as you say a near thing that is i didn t know how near thepoor girl s departure was a flight she went to save herself he had listened more than he showed as came out in his tone to save herself well also really i think to save him too i saw itafterwards i see it all now he would have been sorry he didn twant to hurt her oh i daresay the colonel laughed they generally don t at all events his wife pursued she escaped they both did for they had had simply to face it their marriage couldn t be and if that was so the sooner they put the apennines betweenthem the better it had taken them it is true some time to feelthis and to find it out they had met constantly and not alwayspublicly all that winter they had met more than was known though it was a good deal known more certainly she said than i then imagined though i don t know what difference itwould after all have made with me i liked him i thought himcharming from the first of our knowing him and now after morethan a year he has done nothing to spoil it and there arethings he might have done things that many men easily would therefore i believe in him and i was right at first in knowingi was going to so i haven t and she stated it as she mighthave quoted from a slate after adding up the items the sum of acolumn of figures so i haven t i say to myself been a fool well are you trying to make out that i ve said you have alltheir case wants at any rate bob assingham declared is thatyou should leave it well alone it s theirs now they ve boughtit over the counter and paid for it it has ceased to beyours of which case she asked are you speaking he smoked a minute then with a groan lord are there so many there s maggie s and the prince s and there s the prince s andcharlotte s oh yes and then the colonel scoffed there s charlotte s andthe prince s there s maggie s and charlotte s she went on and there salso maggie s and mine i think too that there s charlotte s andmine yes she mused charlotte s and mine is certainly a case in short you see there are plenty but i mean she said tokeep my head are we to settle them all he inquired to night i should lose it if things had happened otherwise if i hadacted with any folly she had gone on in her earnestness unheeding of his question i shouldn t be able to bear that now but my good conscience is my strength no one can accuse me the ververs came on to rome alone charlotte after their dayswith her in florence had decided about america maggie idaresay had helped her she must have made her a present and ahandsome one so that many things were easy charlotte left them came to england joined somebody or other sailed for new york i have still her letter from milan telling me i didn t know atthe moment all that was behind it but i felt in it neverthelessthe undertaking of a new life certainly in any case it clearedthat air i mean the dear old roman in which we were steeped it left the field free it gave me a free hand there was noquestion for me of anybody else when i brought the two otherstogether more than that there was no question for them so yousee she concluded where that puts me she got up on thewords very much as if they were the blue daylight towards which through a darksome tunnel she had been pushing her way and theelation in her voice combined with her recovered alertness might have signified the sharp whistle of the train that shootsat last into the open she turned about the room she looked outa moment into the august night she stopped here and there before the flowers in bowls and vases yes it was distinctly asif she had proved what was needing proof as if the issue of heroperation had been almost unexpectedly a success oldarithmetic had perhaps been fallacious but the new settled thequestion her husband oddly however kept his place withoutapparently measuring these results as he had been amused at herintensity so he was not uplifted by her relief his interestmight in fact have been more enlisted than he allowed do youmean he presently asked that he had already forgot aboutcharlotte she faced round as if he had touched a spring he wanted to naturally and it was much the best thing he could do she wasin possession of the main case as it truly seemed she had itall now he was capable of the effort and he took the best way remember too what maggie then seemed to us she s very nice but she always seems to me more than anythingelse the young woman who has a million a year if you mean thatthat s what she especially seemed to him you of course place thething in your light the effort to forget charlotte couldn t igrant you have been so difficult this pulled her up but for an instant i never said he didn tfrom the first i never said that he doesn t more and more likemaggie s money i never said i shouldn t have liked it myself bob assinghamreturned he made no movement he smoked another minute howmuch did maggie know how much she seemed to consider as if it were between quartsand gallons how best to express the quantity she knew whatcharlotte in florence had told her and what had charlotte told her very little what makes you so sure why this that she couldn t tell her and she explained alittle what she meant there are things my dear haven t youfelt it yourself coarse as you are that no one could tellmaggie there are things that upon my word i shouldn t care toattempt to tell her now the colonel smoked on it she d be so scandalised she d be so frightened she d be in her strange little way sohurt she wasn t born to know evil she must never know it bob assingham had a queer grim laugh the sound of which infact fixed his wife before him we re taking grand ways toprevent it but she stood there to protest we re not taking any ways theways are all taken they were taken from the moment he came up toour carriage that day in villa borghese the second or third ofher days in rome when as you remember you went off somewherewith mr verver and the prince who had got into the carriagewith us came home with us to tea they had met they had seeneach other well they were in relation the rest was to come ofitself and as it could it began practically i recollect inour drive maggie happened to learn by some other man s greetingof him in the bright roman way from a streetcorner as wepassed that one of the prince s baptismal names the one alwaysused for him among his relations was amerigo which as youprobably don t know however even after a lifetime of me wasthe name four hundred years ago or whenever of the pushing manwho followed across the sea in the wake of columbus andsucceeded where columbus had failed in becoming godfather orname father to the new continent so that the thought of anyconnection with him can even now thrill our artless breasts the colonel s grim placidity could always quite adequately meethis wife s not infrequent imputation of ignorances on the scoreof the land of her birth unperturbed and unashamed and thesedark depths were even at the present moment not directly lightedby an inquiry that managed to be curious without beingapologetic but where does the connection come in his wife was prompt by the women that is by some obligingwoman of old who was a descendant of the pushing man themake believe discoverer and whom the prince is therefore luckilyable to refer to as an ancestress a branch of the other familyhad become great great enough at least to marry into his andthe name of the navigator crowned with glory was verynaturally to become so the fashion among them that some son ofevery generation was appointed to wear it my point is at anyrate that i recall noticing at the time how the prince was fromthe start helped with the dear ververs by his wearing it theconnection became romantic for maggie the moment she took it in she filled out in a flash every link that might be vague bythat sign i quite said to myself he ll conquer with hisgood fortune of course of having the other necessary signs too it really said mrs assingham was practically the fine sideof the wedge which struck me as also she wound up a lovelynote for the candour of the ververs the colonel took in the tale but his comment was prosaic heknew amerigo what he was about and i don t mean the old one i know what you mean his wife bravely threw off the old one he pointed his effect isn t the only discovererin the family oh as much as you like if he discovered america or gothimself honoured as if he had his successors were in due time to discover the americans and it was one of them in particular doubtless who was to discover how patriotic we are wouldn t this be the same one the colonel asked who reallydiscovered what you call the connection she gave him a look the connection s a true thing theconnection s perfectly historic your insinuations recoil uponyour cynical mind don t you understand she asked that thehistory of such people is known root and branch at every momentof its course oh it s all right said bob assingham go to the british museum his companion continued with spirit and what am i to do there there s a whole immense room or recess or department orwhatever filled with books written about his family alone youcan see for yourself have you seen for your self she faltered but an instant certainly i went one day withmaggie we looked him up so to say they were most civil andshe fell again into the current her husband had slightly ruffled the effect was produced the charm began to work at all events in rome from that hour of the prince s drive with us my onlycourse afterwards had to be to make the best of it it wascertainly good enough for that mrs assingham hastened to add and i didn t in the least see my duty in making the worst inthe same situation to day i wouldn t act differently i enteredinto the case as it then appeared to me and as for the matterof that it still does i liked it i thought all sorts of goodof it and nothing can even now she said with some intensity make me think anything else nothing can ever make you think anything you don t want to thecolonel still in his chair remarked over his pipe you ve gota precious power of thinking whatever you do want you want also from moment to moment to think such desperately differentthings what happened he went on was that you fell violentlyin love with the prince yourself and that as you couldn t get meout of the way you had to take some roundabout course youcouldn t marry him any more than charlotte could that is not toyourself but you could to somebody else it was always theprince it was always marriage you could to your little friend to whom there were no objections not only there were no objections but there were reasons positive ones and all excellent all charming she spoke withan absence of all repudiation of his exposure of the spring ofher conduct and this abstention clearly and effectivelyconscious evidently cost her nothing it is always the prince and it is always thank heaven marriage and these are thethings god grant that it will always be that i could help ayear ago most assuredly made me happy and it continues to makeme happy then why aren t you quiet i am quiet said fanny assingham he looked at her with his colourless candour still in hisplace she moved about again a little emphasising by her unresther declaration of her tranquillity he was as silent at first as if he had taken her answer but he was not to keep it long what do you make of it that by your own show charlottecouldn t tell her all what do you make of it that the princedidn t tell her anything say one understands that there arethings she can t be told since as you put it she is so easilyscared and shocked he produced these objections slowly givingher time by his pauses to stop roaming and come back to him but she was roaming still when he concluded his inquiry ifthere hadn t been anything there shouldn t have been between thepair before charlotte bolted in order precisely as you say that there shouldn t be why in the world was what there hadbeen too bad to be spoken of mrs assingham after this question continued still tocirculate not directly meeting it even when at last she stopped i thought you wanted me to be quiet so i do and i m trying to make you so much so that you won tworry more can t you be quiet on that she thought a moment then seemed to try to relate that she hadto bolt for the reasons we speak of even though the boltinghad done for her what she wished that i can perfectly feelcharlotte s not wanting to do ah then if it has done for her what she wished but thecolonel s conclusion hung by the if which his wife didn t takeup so it hung but the longer when he presently spoke again allone wonders in that case is why then she has come back to him say she hasn t come back to him not really to him i ll say anything you like but that won t do me the same goodas your saying it nothing my dear will do you good mrs assingham returned you don t care for anything in itself you care for nothing butto be grossly amused because i don t keep washing my hands i thought your whole argument was that everything is so rightthat this is precisely what you do but his wife as it was a point she had often made could go onas she had gone on before you re perfectly indifferent really you re perfectly immoral you ve taken part in the sack ofcities and i m sure you ve done dreadful things yourself but idon t trouble my head if you like so now there she laughed he accepted her laugh but he kept his way well i back poorcharlotte back her to know what she wants ah then so do i she does know what she wants and mrs assingham produced this quantity at last on the girl s behalf as the ripe result of her late wanderings and musings she hadgroped through their talk for the thread and now she had gotit she wants to be magnificent she is said the colonel almost cynically she wants his wife now had it fast to be thoroughly superior and she s capable of that of wanting to of carrying out her idea and what is her idea to see maggie through bob assingham wondered through what through everything she knows the prince and maggie doesn t no dear thing mrs assingham had torecognise it she doesn t so that charlotte has come out to give her lessons she continued fanny assingham to work out her thought she hasdone this great thing for him that is a year ago shepractically did it she practically at any rate helped him todo it himself and helped me to help him she kept off shestayed away she left him free and what moreover were hersilences to maggie but a direct aid to him if she had spoken inflorence if she had told her own poor story if she had comeback at any time till within a few weeks ago if she hadn t goneto new york and hadn t held out there if she hadn t done thesethings all that has happened since would certainly have beendifferent therefore she s in a position to be consistent now she knows the prince mrs assingham repeated it involved evenagain her former recognition and maggie dear thing doesn t she was high she was lucid she was almost inspired and it wasbut the deeper drop therefore to her husband s flat common sense in other words maggie is by her ignorance in danger then ifshe s in danger there is danger there won t be with charlotte s understanding of it that swhere she has had her conception of being able to be heroic ofbeing able in fact to be sublime she is she will be the goodlady by this time glowed so she sees it to become for herbest friend an element of positive safety bob assingham looked at it hard which of them do you call herbest friend she gave a toss of impatience i ll leave you to discover butthe grand truth thus made out she had now completely adopted it s for us therefore to be hers hers you and i it s for us to be charlotte s it s for us on ourside to see her through through her sublimity through her noble lonely life only that s essential itmustn t be lonely it will be all right if she marries so we re to marry her we re to marry her it will be mrs assingham continued thegreat thing i can do she made it out more and more it willmake up make up for what as she said nothing however his desire forlucidity renewed itself if everything s so all right what isthere to make up for why if i did do either of them by any chance a wrong if imade a mistake you ll make up for it by making another and then as she againtook her time i thought your whole point is just that you resure one can never be ideally sure of anything there are alwayspossibilities then if we can but strike so wild why keep meddling it made her again look at him where would you have been mydear if i hadn t meddled with you ah that wasn t meddling i was your own i was your own saidthe colonel from the moment i didn t object well these people won t object they are my own too in thesense that i m awfully fond of them also in the sense shecontinued that i think they re not so very much less fond ofme our relation all round exists it s a reality and a verygood one we re mixed up so to speak and it s too late tochange it we must live in it and with it therefore to see thatcharlotte gets a good husband as soon as possible that as isay will be one of my ways of living it will cover she saidwith conviction all the ground and then as his own convictionappeared to continue as little to match the ground i mean ofany nervousness i may ever feel it will be in fact my dutyand i shan t rest till my duty s performed she had arrived bythis time at something like exaltation i shall give for thenext year or two if necessary my life to it i shall have donein that case what i can he took it at last as it came you hold there s no limit to whatyou can i don t say there s no limit or anything of the sort i saythere are good chances enough of them for hope why shouldn tthere be when a girl is after all all that she is by after all you mean after she s in love with somebody else the colonel put his question with a quietude doubtless designedto be fatal but it scarcely pulled her up she s not too muchin love not herself to want to marry she would now particularlylike to has she told you so not yet it s too soon but she will meanwhile however idon t require the information her marrying will prove thetruth and what truth the truth of everything i say prove it to whom well to myself to begin with that will be enough for me towork for her what it will prove mrs assingham presently wenton will be that she s cured that she accepts the situation he paid this the tribute of a long pull at his pipe thesituation of doing the one thing she can that will really seem tocover her tracks his wife looked at him the good dry man as if now at last hewas merely vulgar the one thing she can do that will reallymake new tracks altogether the thing that before any other will be wise and right the thing that will best give her herchance to be magnificent he slowly emitted his smoke and best give you by the sametoken yours to be magnificent with her i shall be as magnificent at least as i can bob assingham got up and you call me immoral she hesitated i ll call you stupid if you prefer but stupiditypushed to a certain point is you know immorality just so whatis morality but high intelligence this he was unable to tellher which left her more definitely to conclude besides it sall at the worst great fun oh if you simply put it at that his implication was that in this case they had a common ground yet even thus he couldn t catch her by it oh i don t mean she said from the threshold the fun that you mean good night in answer to which as he turned out the electric light he gavean odd short groan almost a grunt he had apparently meant someparticular kind v well now i must tell you for i want to be absolutely honest so charlotte spoke a little ominously after they had got intothe park i don t want to pretend and i can t pretend a momentlonger you may think of me what you will but i don t care iknew i shouldn t and i find now how little i came back for this not really for anything else for this she repeated as underthe influence of her tone the prince had already come to apause for this he spoke as if the particular thing she indicatedwere vague to him or were rather a quantity that couldn t atthe most be much it would be as much however as she should be able to make it to have one hour alone with you it had rained heavily in thenight and though the pavements were now dry thanks to acleansing breeze the august morning with its hovering thick drifting clouds and freshened air was cool and grey themultitudinous green of the park had been deepened and awholesome smell of irrigation purging the place of dust and ofodours less acceptable rose from the earth charlotte had lookedabout her with expression from the first of their coming in quite as if for a deep greeting for general recognition the daywas even in the heart of london of a rich low browed weatherwashed english type it was as if it had been waiting forher as if she knew it placed it loved it as if it were infact a part of what she had come back for so far as this was thecase the impression of course could only be lost on a mere vagueitalian it was one of those for which you had to be blessedly an american as indeed you had to be blessedly an american forall sorts of things so long as you hadn t blessedly or not toremain in america the prince had by half past ten as also bydefinite appointment called in cadogan place for mrs assingham s visitor and then after brief delay the two hadwalked together up sloane street and got straight into the parkfrom knightsbridge the understanding to this end had taken itsplace after a couple of days as inevitably consequent on theappeal made by the girl during those first moments in mrs assingham s drawing room it was an appeal the couple of days haddone nothing to invalidate everything much rather to place ina light and as to which obviously it wouldn t have fitted thatanyone should raise an objection who was there for that matter to raise one from the moment mrs assingham informed andapparently not disapproving didn t intervene this the young manhad asked himself with a very sufficient sense of what wouldhave made him ridiculous he wasn t going to begin that at leastwas certain by showing a fear even had fear at first been sharpin him moreover it would already not a little have dropped so happy all round so propitious he quite might have calledit had been the effect of this rapid interval the time had been taken up largely by his active reception of hisown wedding guests and by maggie s scarce less absorbedentertainment of her friend whom she had kept for hours togetherin portland place whom she had not as wouldn t have beenconvenient invited altogether as yet to migrate but who hadbeen present with other persons his contingent at luncheon attea at dinner at perpetual repasts he had never in his life it struck him had to reckon with so much eating whenever he hadlooked in if he had not again till this hour save for aminute seen charlotte alone so positively all the while hehad not seen even maggie and if therefore he had not seen evenmaggie nothing was more natural than that he shouldn t have seencharlotte the exceptional minute a mere snatch at the tail ofthe others on the huge portland place staircase had sufficientlyenabled the girl to remind him so ready she assumed him to be of what they were to do time pressed if they were to do it atall everyone had brought gifts his relations had broughtwonders how did they still have where did they still find suchtreasures she only had brought nothing and she was ashamed yeteven by the sight of the rest of the tribute she wouldn t be putoff she would do what she could and he was unknown to maggie he must remember to give her his aid he had prolonged theminute so far as to take time to hesitate for a reason and thento risk bringing his reason out the risk was because he mighthurt her hurt her pride if she had that particular sort butshe might as well be hurt one way as another and besides thatparticular sort of pride was just what she hadn t so his slightresistance while they lingered had been just easy enough not tobe impossible i hate to encourage you and for such a purpose after all tospend your money she had stood a stair or two below him where while she lookedup at him beneath the high domed light of the hall she rubbedwith her palm the polished mahogany of the balustrade which wasmounted on fine ironwork eighteenth century english becauseyou think i must have so little i ve enough at any rate enoughfor us to take our hour enough she had smiled is as good asa feast and then she had said it isn t of course a questionof anything expensive gorged with treasure as maggie is itisn t a question of competing or outshining what naturally inthe way of the priceless hasn t she got mine is to be theoffering of the poor something precisely that no rich personcould ever give her and that being herself too rich ever to buyit she would therefore never have charlotte had spoken as ifafter so much thought only as it can t be fine it ought to befunny and that s the sort of thing to hunt for hunting inlondon besides is amusing in itself he recalled even how he had been struck with her word funny oh i don t mean a comic toy i mean some little thing with acharm but absolutely right in its comparative cheapness that swhat i call funny she had explained you used she had alsoadded to help me to get things cheap in rome you were splendidfor beating down i have them all still i needn t say thelittle bargains i there owed you there are bargains in london inaugust ah but i don t understand your english buying and i confess ifind it dull so much as that while they turned to go uptogether he had objected i understood my poor dear romans it was they who understood you that was your pull she hadlaughed our amusement here is just that they don t understandus we can make it amusing you ll see if he had hesitated again it was because the point permitted the amusement surely will be to find our present certainly as i say well if they don t come down then we ll come up there s always something to be done besides prince she had gone on i m not if you come to that absolutely a pauper i m too poor for some things she hadsaid yet strange as she was lightly enough but i m not toopoor for others and she had paused again at the top i ve beensaving up he had really challenged it in america yes even there with my motive and we oughtn t you know shehad wound up to leave it beyond to morrow that definitely with ten words more was what had passed hefeeling all the while how any sort of begging off would onlymagnify it he might get on with things as they were but he mustdo anything rather than magnify besides which it was pitiful tomake her beg of him he was making her she had begged and this for a special sensibility in him didn t at all do that wasaccordingly in fine how they had come to where they were hewas engaged as hard as possible in the policy of notmagnifying he had kept this up even on her making a point andas if it were almost the whole point that maggie of course wasnot to have an idea half the interest of the thing at leastwould be that she shouldn t suspect therefore he was completelyto keep it from her as charlotte on her side would that theyhad been anywhere at all together or had so much as seen eachother for five minutes alone the absolute secrecy of theirlittle excursion was in short of the essence she appealed to hiskindness to let her feel that he didn t betray her there hadbeen something frankly a little disconcerting in such an appealat such an hour on the very eve of his nuptials it was onething to have met the girl casually at mrs assingham s andanother to arrange with her thus for a morning practically asprivate as their old mornings in rome and practically not lessintimate he had immediately told maggie the same evening ofthe minutes that had passed between them in cadogan place thoughnot mentioning those of mrs assingham s absence any more than hementioned the fact of what their friend had then with such smalldelay proposed but what had briefly checked his assent to anypresent to any positive making of mystery what had made him while they stood at the top of the stairs demur just long enoughfor her to notice it was the sense of the resemblance of thelittle plan before him to occasions of the past from which hewas quite disconnected from which he could only desire to be this was like beginning something over which was the last thinghe wanted the strength the beauty of his actual position was inits being wholly a fresh start was that what it began would benew altogether these items of his consciousness had clustered soquickly that by the time charlotte read them in his face he wasin presence of what they amounted to she had challenged them assoon as read them had met them with a do you want then to goand tell her that had somehow made them ridiculous it had madehim promptly fall back on minimizing it that is on minimizing fuss apparent scruples were obviously fuss and he had onthe spot clutched in the light of this truth at the happyprinciple that would meet every case this principle was simply to be with the girl always simple and with the very last simplicity that would cover everything it had covered then and there certainly his immediatesubmission to the sight of what was clearest this was really that what she asked was little compared to what she gave whatshe gave touched him as she faced him for it was the full tuneof her renouncing she really renounced renounced everything and without even insisting now on what it had all been for her her only insistence was her insistence on the small matter oftheir keeping their appointment to themselves that in exchangefor everything everything she gave up was verily but atrifle he let himself accordingly be guided he so soonassented for enlightened indulgence to any particular turn shemight wish the occasion to take that the stamp of her preferencehad been well applied to it even while they were still in thepark the application in fact presently required that they shouldsit down a little really to see where they were in obedience towhich propriety they had some ten minutes of a quality quitedistinct in a couple of penny chairs under one of the largertrees they had taken for their walk to the cropped rain freshened grass after finding it already dry and thechairs turned away from the broad alley the main drive and theaspect of park lane looked across the wide reaches of greenwhich seemed in a manner to refine upon their freedom theyhelped charlotte thus to make her position her temporaryposition still more clear and it was for this purpose obviously that abruptly on seeing her opportunity she satdown he stood for a little before her as if to mark theimportance of not wasting time the importance she herself hadpreviously insisted on but after she had said a few words it wasimpossible for him not to resort again to good nature he markedas he could by this concession that if he had finally met herfirst proposal for what would be amusing in it so any idea shemight have would contribute to that effect he had consequently in all consistency to treat it as amusing that she reaffirmed and reaffirmed again the truth that was her truth i don t care what you make of it and i don t ask anythingwhatever of you anything but this i want to have said it that s all i want not to have failed to say it to see you onceand be with you to be as we are now and as we used to be forone small hour or say for two that s what i have had for weeksin my head i mean of course to get it before before whatyou re going to do so all the while you see she went on withher eyes on him it was a question for me if i should be able tomanage it in time if i couldn t have come now i probablyshouldn t have come at all perhaps even ever now that i m herei shall stay but there were moments over there when idespaired it wasn t easy there were reasons but it was eitherthis or nothing so i didn t struggle you see in vain after oh i didn t want that i don t mean she smiled that itwouldn t have been delightful to see you even then to see you atany time but i would never have come for it this is different this is what i wanted this is what i ve got this is what ishall always have this is what i should have missed of course she pursued if you had chosen to make me miss it if you hadthought me horrid had refused to come i should naturally havebeen immensely sold i had to take the risk well you re all icould have hoped that s what i was to have said i didn t wantsimply to get my time with you but i wanted you to know iwanted you she kept it up slowly softly with a small tremorof voice but without the least failure of sense or sequence iwanted you to understand i wanted you that is to hear i don tcare i think whether you understand or not if i ask nothing ofyou i don t i mayn t ask even so much as that what you maythink of me that doesn t in the least matter what i want isthat it shall always be with you so that you ll never be ablequite to get rid of it that i did i won t say that you did youmay make as little of that as you like but that i was here withyou where we are and as we are i just saying this givingmyself in other words away and perfectly willing to do it fornothing that s all she paused as if her demonstration was complete yet for themoment without moving as if in fact to give it a few minutes tosink in into the listening air into the watching space intothe conscious hospitality of nature so far as nature was alllondonised all vulgarised with them there or even for thatmatter into her own open ears rather than into the attention ofher passive and prudent friend his attention had done all thatattention could do his handsome slightly anxious yet stillmore definitely amused face sufficiently played its part heclutched however at what he could best clutch at the fact thatshe let him off definitely let him off she let him off itseemed even from so much as answering so that while he smiledback at her in return for her information he felt his lips remainclosed to the successive vaguenesses of rejoinder of objection that rose for him from within charlotte herself spoke again atlast you may want to know what i get by it but that s my ownaffair he really didn t want to know even this or continued for the safest plan quite to behave as if he didn t whichprolonged the mere dumbness of diversion in which he had takenrefuge he was glad when finally the point she had wished tomake seeming established to her satisfaction they brought towhat might pass for a close the moment of his life at which hehad had least to say movement and progress after this withmore impersonal talk were naturally a relief so that he was notagain during their excursion at a loss for the right word theair had been as it were cleared they had their errand itselfto discuss and the opportunities of london the sense of thewonderful place the pleasures of prowling there the question ofshops of possibilities of particular objects noticed by eachin previous prowls each professed surprise at the extent of theother s knowledge the prince in especial wondered at hisfriend s possession of her london he had rather prized his ownpossession the guidance he could really often give a cabman itwas a whim of his own a part of his anglomania and congruouswith that feature which had after all so much more surfacethan depth when his companion with the memory of other visitsand other rambles spoke of places he hadn t seen and things hedidn t know he actually felt again as half the effect just ashade humiliated he might even have felt a trifle annoyed if ithadn t been on this spot for his being even more interested it was a fresh light on charlotte and on her curiousworld quality of which in rome he had had his due sense butwhich clearly would show larger on the big london stage romewas in comparison a village a family party a little old worldspinnet for the fingers of one hand by the time they reached themarble arch it was almost as if she were showing him a new side and that in fact gave amusement a new and a firmer basis theright tone would be easy for putting himself in her hands shouldthey disagree a little frankly and fairly about directions andchances values and authenticities the situation would be quitegloriously saved they were none the less as happened much ofone mind on the article of their keeping clear of resorts withwhich maggie would be acquainted charlotte recalled it as amatter of course named it in time as a condition they wouldkeep away from any place to which he had already been withmaggie this made indeed a scant difference for though he had during thelast month done few things so much as attend his future wife onher making of purchases the antiquarii as he called them withcharlotte had not been the great affair except in bond street really maggie had had no use for them her situation indeed inconnection with that order of traffic was full of consequencesproduced by her father s mr verver one of the great collectorsof the world hadn t left his daughter to prowl for herself hehad little to do with shops and was mostly as a purchaser approached privately and from afar great people all overeurope sought introductions to him high personages incrediblyhigh and more of them than would ever be known solemnly swornas everyone was in such cases to discretion high personagesmade up to him as the one man on the short authentic list likelyto give the price it had therefore been easy to settle as theywalked that the tracks of the ververs daughter s as well asfather s were to be avoided the importance only was that theirtalk about it led for a moment to the first words they had as yetexchanged on the subject of maggie charlotte still in the park proceeded to them for it was she who began with a serenity ofappreciation that was odd certainly as a sequel to her words often minutes before this was another note on her what he wouldhave called another light for her companion who though withoutgiving a sign admired for what it was the simplicity of hertransition a transition that took no trouble either to trace orto explain itself she paused again an instant on the grass tomake it she stopped before him with a sudden anything ofcourse dear as she is will do for her i mean if i were to giveher a pin cushion from the baker street bazaar that s exactly what i meant the prince laughed out thisallusion to their snatch of talk in portland place it s justwhat i suggested she took however no notice of the reminder she went on in herown way but it isn t a reason in that case one would never doanything for her i mean charlotte explained if one tookadvantage of her character of her character we mustn t take advantage of her character the girl againunheeding pursued one mustn t if not for her at least forone s self she saves one such trouble she had spoken thoughtfully with her eyes on her friend s shemight have been talking preoccupied and practical of someonewith whom he was comparatively unconnected she certainly givesone no trouble said the prince and then as if this wereperhaps ambiguous or inadequate she s not selfish god forgiveher enough that s what i mean charlotte instantly said she s notselfish enough there s nothing absolutely that one need do forher she s so modest she developed she doesn t miss things imean if you love her or rather i should say if she loves you she lets it go the prince frowned a little as a tribute after all toseriousness she lets what anything anything that you might do and that you don t shelets everything go but her own disposition to be kind to you it s of herself that she asks efforts so far as she ever has toask them she hasn t much she does everything herself andthat s terrible the prince had listened but always with propriety he didn tcommit himself terrible well unless one is almost as good as she it makes too easyterms for one it takes stuff within one so far as one sdecency is concerned to stand it and nobody charlottecontinued in the same manner is decent enough good enough tostand it not without help from religion or something of thatkind not without prayer and fasting that is without takinggreat care certainly she said such people as you and i arenot the prince obligingly thought an instant not good enough tostand it well not good enough not rather to feel the strain we happeneach i think to be of the kind that are easily spoiled her friend again for propriety followed the argument oh idon t know may not one s affection for her do something more forone s decency as you call it than her own generosity her ownaffection her decency has the unfortunate virtue to undo ah of course it must be all in that but she had made her question all the same interesting to him what it comes to one can see what you mean is the way shebelieves in one that is if she believes at all yes that s what it comes to said charlotte stant and why he asked almost soothingly should it be terrible he couldn t at the worst see that because it s always so the idea of having to pity people not when there s also with it the idea of helping them yes but if we can t help them we can we always can that is he competently added if wecare for them and that s what we re talking about yes she on the whole assented it comes back then to ourabsolutely refusing to be spoiled certainly but everything the prince laughed as they went on all your decency i mean comes back to that she walked beside him a moment it s just what i meant shethen reasonably said vithe man in the little shop in which well after this theylingered longest the small but interesting dealer in thebloomsbury street who was remarkable for an insistence notimportunate inasmuch as it was mainly mute but singularly intensely coercive this personage fixed on his visitors anextraordinary pair of eyes and looked from one to the other whilethey considered the object with which he appeared mainly to hopeto tempt them they had come to him last for their time wasnearly up an hour of it at least from the moment of theirgetting into a hansom at the marble arch having yielded nobetter result than the amusement invoked from the first theamusement of course was to have consisted in seeking but ithad also involved the idea of finding which latter necessitywould have been obtrusive only if they had found too soon thequestion at present was if they were finding and they put it toeach other in the bloomsbury shop while they enjoyed theundiverted attention of the shopman he was clearly the master and devoted to his business the essence of which in hisconception might precisely have been this particular secret thathe possessed for worrying the customer so little that it fairlymade for their relations a sort of solemnity he had not manythings none of the redundancy of rot they had elsewhere seen and our friends had on entering even had the sense of a musterso scant that as high values obviously wouldn t reign theeffect might be almost pitiful then their impression hadchanged for though the show was of small pieces several takenfrom the little window and others extracted from a cupboardbehind the counter dusky in the rather low browed place despite its glass doors each bid for their attention spoke however modestly for itself and the pitch of theirentertainer s pretensions was promptly enough given his arraywas heterogeneous and not at all imposing still it differedagreeably from what they had hitherto seen charlotte after the incident was to be full of impressions ofseveral of which later on she gave her companion always in theinterest of their amusement the benefit and one of theimpressions had been that the man himself was the greatestcuriosity they had looked at the prince was to reply to thisthat he himself hadn t looked at him as precisely in thegeneral connection charlotte had more than once from otherdays noted for his advantage her consciousness of how below acertain social plane he never saw one kind of shopman was justlike another to him which was oddly inconsequent on the part ofa mind that where it did notice noticed so much he tookthroughout always the meaner sort for granted the night oftheir meanness or whatever name one might give it for him madeall his cats grey he didn t no doubt want to hurt them but heimaged them no more than if his eyes acted only for the level ofhis own high head her own vision acted for every relation thishe had seen for himself she remarked beggars she rememberedservants she recognised cabmen she had often distinguishedbeauty when out with him in dirty children she had admired type in faces at hucksters stalls therefore on thisoccasion she had found their antiquario interesting partlybecause he cared so for his things and partly because he cared well so for them he likes his things he loves them she wasto say and it isn t only it isn t perhaps even at all that heloves to sell them i think he would love to keep them if hecould and he prefers at any rate to sell them to right people we clearly were right people he knows them when he sees them and that s why as i say you could make out or at least i could that he cared for us didn t you see she was to ask itwith an insistence the way he looked at us and took us in idoubt if either of us have ever been so well looked at before yes he ll remember us she was to profess herself convinced ofthat almost to uneasiness but it was after all this wasperhaps reassuring because given his taste since he hastaste he was pleased with us he was struck he had ideas aboutus well i should think people might we re beautiful aren twe and he knows then also he has his way for that way ofsaying nothing with his lips when he s all the while pressing youso with his face which shows how he knows you feel it that is aregular way of decent old gold old silver old bronze of old chased andjewelled artistry were the objects that successively produced had ended by numerously dotting the counter where the shopman sslim light fingers with neat nails

snapping little box there was in spite of the dueproportion of faint poetry no great force of persuasion theylooked the visitors they touched they vaguely pretended toconsider but with scepticism so far as courtesy permitted inthe quality of their attention it was impossible they shouldn t after a little tacitly agree as to the absurdity of carrying tomaggie a token from such a stock it would be that was thedifficulty pretentious without being good too usual as atreasure to have been an inspiration of the giver and yet tooprimitive to be taken as tribute welcome on any terms they hadbeen out more than two hours and evidently had found nothing it forced from charlotte a kind of admission it ought really if it should be a thing of this sort to takeits little value from having belonged to one s self ecco said the prince just triumphantly enough there youare behind the dealer were sundry small cupboards in the wall two orthree of these charlotte had seen him open so that her eyesfound themselves resting on those he had not visited but shecompleted her admission there s nothing here she could wear it was only after a moment that her companion rejoined is thereanything do you think that you could it made her just start she didn t at all events look at theobjects she but looked for an instant very directly at him no ah the prince quietly exclaimed would it be charlotte asked your idea to offer mesomething well why not as a small ricordo but a ricordo of what why of this as you yourself say of this little hunt oh i say it but hasn t my whole point been that i don t askyou to therefore she demanded but smiling at him now where s the logic oh the logic he laughed but logic s everything that at least is how i feel it aricordo from you from you to me is a ricordo of nothing ithas no reference ah my dear he vaguely protested their entertainer meanwhile stood there with his eyes on them and the girl though at this minute more interested in her passage with herfriend than in anything else again met his gaze it was acomfort to her that their foreign tongue covered what they said and they might have appeared of course as the prince now had oneof the snuffboxes in his hand to be discussing a purchase you don t refer she went on to her companion i refer he had lifted the lid of his little box and he looked into ithard do you mean by that then that you would be free free to offer me something this gave her a longer pause and when she spoke again she mighthave seemed oddly to be addressing the dealer would you allowme no said the prince into his little box you wouldn t accept it from me no he repeated in the same way she exhaled a long breath that was like a guarded sigh butyou ve touched an idea that has been mine it s what i vewanted then she added it was what i hoped he put down his box this had drawn his eyes he made nothing clearly of the little man s attention it s what you brought meout for well that s at any rate she returned my own affair butit won t do it won t do cara mia it s impossible it s impossible and he took up one of the brooches she had another pause while the shopman only waited if i wereto accept from you one of these charming little ornaments as yousuggest what should i do with it he was perhaps at last a little irritated he even as if hemight understand looked vaguely across at their host wear it per bacco where then please under my clothes wherever you like but it isn t then if you will he added worth talking about it s only worth talking about mio caro she smiled from yourhaving begun it my question is only reasonable so that youridea may stand or fall by your answer to it if i should pin oneof these things on for you would it be to your mind that imight go home and show it to maggie as your present they had had between them often in talk the refrain jocosely descriptively applied of old roman it had been as apleasantry in the other time his explanation to her ofeverything but nothing truly had even seemed so old roman asthe shrug in which he now indulged why in the world not because on our basis it would be impossible to give her anaccount of the pretext the pretext he wondered the occasion this ramble that we shall have had together andthat we re not to speak of oh yes he said after a moment i remember we re not to speakof it that of course you re pledged to and the one thing you see goes with the other so you don t insist he had again at random laid back his trinket with which hequite turned to her a little wearily at last even a littleimpatiently i don t insist it disposed for the time of the question but what was nextapparent was that it had seen them no further the shopman whohad not stirred stood there in his patience which his muteintensity helping had almost the effect of an ironic comment the prince moved to the glass door and his back to the others as with nothing more to contribute looked though not lesspatiently into the street then the shopman for charlotte momentously broke silence you ve seen disgraziatamente signora principessa he sadly said too much and it made theprince face about for the effect of the momentous came if notfrom the sense from the sound of his words which was that ofthe suddenest sharpest italian charlotte exchanged with herfriend a glance that matched it and just for the minute theywere held in check but their glance had after all by thattime said more than one thing had both exclaimed on theapprehension by the wretch of their intimate conversation letalone of her possible her impossible title and remarked formutual reassurance that it didn t all the same matter theprince remained by the door but immediately addressing thespeaker from where he stood you re italian then are you but the reply came in english oh dear no you re english to which the answer was this time with a smile in briefestitalian che the dealer waived the question he practicallydisposed of it by turning straightway toward a receptacle towhich he had not yet resorted and from which after unlocking it he extracted a square box of some twenty inches in height covered with worn looking leather he placed the box on thecounter pushed back a pair of small hooks lifted the lid andremoved from its nest a drinking vessel larger than a common cup yet not of exorbitant size and formed to appearance either ofold fine gold or of some material once richly gilt he handled itwith tenderness with ceremony making a place for it on a smallsatin mat my golden bowl he observed and it sounded on hislips as if it said everything he left the important object foras important it did somehow present itself to produce itscertain effect simple but singularly elegant it stood on acircular foot a short pedestal with a slightly spreading base and though not of signal depth justified its title by the charmof its shape as well as by the tone of its surface it might havebeen a large goblet diminished to the enhancement of its happycurve by half its original height as formed of solid gold itwas impressive it seemed indeed to warn off the prudent admirer charlotte with care immediately took it up while the prince who had after a minute shifted his position again regarded itfrom a distance it was heavier than charlotte had thought gold really gold she asked of their companion he hesitated look a little and perhaps you ll make out she looked holding it up in both her fine hands turning it tothe light it may be cheap for what it is but it will be dear i m afraid for me well said the man i can part with it for less than itsvalue i got it you see for less for how much then again he waited always with his serene stare do you like itthen charlotte turned to her friend do you like it he came nonearer he looked at their companion cos e well signori miei if you must know it s just a perfectcrystal of course we must know per dio said the prince but he turnedaway again he went back to his glass door charlotte set down the bowl she was evidently taken do youmean it s cut out of a single crystal if it isn t i think i can promise you that you ll never find anyjoint or any piecing she wondered even if i were to scrape off the gold he showed though with due respect that she amused him youcouldn t scrape it off it has been too well put on put on idon t know when and i don t know how but by some very fine oldworker and by some beautiful old process charlotte frankly charmed with the cup smiled back at him now a lost art call it a lost art but of what time then is the whole thing well say also of a lost time the girl considered then if it s so precious how comes it tobe cheap her interlocutor once more hung fire but by this time the princehad lost patience i ll wait for you out in the air he said tohis companion and though he spoke without irritation hepointed his remark by passing immediately into the street where during the next minutes the others saw him his back to theshopwindow philosophically enough hover and light a freshcigarette charlotte even took a little her time she was awareof his funny italian taste for london street life her host meanwhile at any rate answered her question ah i vehad it a long time without selling it i think i must have beenkeeping it madam for you you ve kept it for me because you ve thought i mightn t seewhat s the matter with it he only continued to face her he only continued to appear tofollow the play of her mind what is the matter with it oh it s not for me to say it s for you honestly to tell me ofcourse i know something must be but if it s something you can t find out isn t it as good as ifit were nothing i probably should find out as soon as i had paid for it not her host lucidly insisted if you hadn t paid too much what do you call she asked little enough well what should you say to fifteen pounds i should say said charlotte with the utmost promptitude thatit s altogether too much the dealer shook his head slowly and sadly but firmly it s myprice madam and if you admire the thing i think it really mightbe yours it s not too much it s too little it s almostnothing i can t go lower charlotte wondering but resisting bent over the bowl again then it s impossible it s more than i can afford ah the man returned one can sometimes afford for a presentmore than one can afford for one s self he said it so coaxinglythat she found herself going on without as might be said putting him in his place oh of course it would be only for apresent then it would be a lovely one does one make a present she asked of an object thatcontains to one s knowledge a flaw well if one knows of it one has only to mention it the goodfaith the man smiled is always there and leave the person to whom one gives the thing you mean todiscover it he wouldn t discover it if you re speaking of a gentleman i m not speaking of anyone in particular charlotte said well whoever it might be he might know and he might try buthe wouldn t find she kept her eyes on him as if though unsatisfied mystified she yet had a fancy for the bowl not even if the thing shouldcome to pieces and then as he was silent not even if heshould have to say to me the golden bowl is broken he was still silent after which he had his strangest smile ah if anyone should want to smash it she laughed she almost admired the little man s expression youmean one could smash it with a hammer yes if nothing else would do or perhaps even by dashing itwith violence say upon a marble floor oh marble floors but she might have been thinking for theywere a connection marble floors a connection with many things with her old rome and with his with the palaces of his past and a little of hers with the possibilities of his future with the sumptuosities of his marriage with the wealth of theververs all the same however there were other things and theyall together held for a moment her fancy does crystal thenbreak when it is crystal i thought its beauty was itshardness her friend in his way discriminated its beauty is its beingcrystal but its hardness is certainly its safety it doesn tbreak he went on like vile glass it splits if there is asplit ah charlotte breathed with interest if there is a split and she looked down again at the bowl there is a split eh crystal does split eh on lines and by laws of its own you mean if there s a weak place for all answer after an hesitation he took the bowl up again holding it aloft and tapping it with a key it rang with thefinest sweetest sound where is the weak place she then did the question justice well for me only the price i m poor you see very poor but i thank you and i ll think the prince on the other side of the shop window had finallyfaced about and as to see if she hadn t done was trying toreach with his eyes the comparatively dim interior i likeit she said i want it but i must decide what i can do the man not ungraciously resigned himself well i ll keep itfor you the small quarter of an hour had had its marked oddity this shefelt even by the time the open air and the bloomsbury aspects hadagain in their protest against the truth of her gatheredimpression made her more or less their own yet the oddity mighthave been registered as small as compared to the other effectthat before they had gone much further she had with hercompanion to take account of this latter was simply the effectof their having by some tacit logic some queer inevitability quite dropped the idea of a continued pursuit they didn t sayso but it was on the line of giving up maggie s present thatthey practically proceeded the line of giving it up without morereference to it the prince s first reference was in fact quiteindependently made i hope you satisfied yourself before youhad done of what was the matter with that bowl no indeed i satisfied myself of nothing of nothing at leastbut that the more i looked at it the more i liked it and that ifyou weren t so unaccommodating this would be just the occasionfor your giving me the pleasure of accepting it he looked graver for her at this than he had looked all themorning do you propose it seriously without wishing to play mea trick she wondered what trick would it be he looked at her harder you mean you really don t know but know what why what s the matter with it you didn t see all the while she only continued however to stare how could you see out inthe street i saw before i went out it was because i saw that i did go out i didn t want to have another scene with you before that rascal and i judged you would presently guess for yourself is he a rascal charlotte asked his price is so moderate shewaited but a moment five pounds really so little five pounds he continued to look at her five pounds he might have been doubting her word but he was only itappeared gathering emphasis it would be dear to make a giftof at five shillings if it had cost you even but five pence iwouldn t take it from you then she asked what is the matter why it has a crack it sounded on his lips so sharp it had such an authority thatshe almost started while her colour at the word rose it wasas if he had been right though his assurance was wonderful youanswer for it without having looked i did look i saw the object itself it told its story nowonder it s cheap but it s exquisite charlotte as if with an interest in it nowmade even tenderer and stranger found herself moved to insist of course it s exquisite that s the danger then a lightvisibly came to her a light in which her friend suddenly andintensely showed the reflection of it as she smiled at him wasin her own face the danger i see is because you resuperstitious per dio i m superstitious a crack is a crack and an omen s anomen you d be afraid per bacco for your happiness for my happiness for your safety for my safety she just paused for your marriage for my marriage for everything she thought again thank goodness then that if there be a crackwe know it but if we may perish by cracks in things that wedon t know and she smiled with the sadness of it we cannever then give each other anything he considered but he met it ah but one does know i do atleast and by instinct i don t fail that will always protectme it was funny the way he said such things yet she liked him really the more for it they fell in for her with a general orrather with a special vision but she spoke with a mild despair what then will protect me where i m concerned i will from me at least you ve nothing tofear he now quite amiably responded anything you consent toaccept from me but he paused well well shall be perfect that s very fine she presently answered it s vain afterall for you to talk of my accepting things when you ll acceptnothing from me ah there better still he could meet her you attach animpossible condition that i mean of my keeping your gift so tomyself well she looked before him there at the condition then abruptly with a gesture she gave it up she had a headshake ofdisenchantment so far as the idea had appealed to her it allappeared too difficult oh my condition i don t hold to it you may cry it on the housetops anything i ever do ah well then this made he laughed all the difference but it was too late oh i don t care now i should have likedthe bowl but if that won t do there s nothing he considered this he took it in looking graver again butafter a moment he qualified yet i shall want some day to giveyou something she wondered at him what day the day you marry for you will marry you must seriously marry she took it from him but it determined in her the only words shewas to have uttered all the morning that came out as if aspring had been pressed to make you feel better well he replied frankly wonderfully it will but here headded is your hansom he had signalled the cab was charging she put out no hand fortheir separation but she prepared to get in before she did so however she said what had been gathering while she waited well i would marry i think to have something from you in allfreedom part secondviiadam verver at fawns that autumn sunday might have beenobserved to open the door of the billiard room with a certainfreedom might have been observed that is had there been aspectator in the field the justification of the push he hadapplied however and of the push equally sharp that to shuthimself in he again applied the ground of this energy wasprecisely that he might here however briefly find himselfalone alone with the handful of letters newspapers and otherunopened missives to which during and since breakfast he hadlacked opportunity to give an eye the vast square cleanapartment was empty and its large clear windows looked out intospaces of terrace and garden of park and woodland and shiningartificial lake of

tortuouscorridors investing him with an interest that makes ourattention tender indeed almost to compassion qualify hisachieved isolation for it may immediately be mentioned that thisamiable man bethought himself of his personal advantage ingeneral only when it might appear to him that other advantages those of other persons had successfully put in their claim itmay be mentioned also that he always figured other persons suchwas the law of his nature as a numerous array and that thoughconscious of but a single near tie one affection one dutydeepest rooted in his life it had never for many minutestogether been his portion not to feel himself surrounded andcommitted never quite been his refreshment to make out where themany coloured human appeal represented by gradations of tint diminishing concentric zones of intensity of importunity reallyfaded to the blessed impersonal whiteness for which his visionsometimes ached it shaded off the appeal he would haveadmitted that but he had as yet noted no point at which itpositively stopped thus had grown in him a little habit his innermost secret notconfided even to maggie though he felt she understood it as sheunderstood to his view everything thus had shaped itself theinnocent trick of occasionally making believe that he had noconscience or at least that blankness in the field of duty didreign for an hour a small game to which the few persons nearenough to have caught him playing it and of whom mrs assingham for instance was one attached indulgently that idea ofquaintness quite in fact that charm of the pathetic involved inthe preservation by an adult of one of childhood s toys when hetook a rare moment off he did so with the touching confessingeyes of a man of forty seven caught in the act of handling arelic

in spite of practice he was stillimperfect for these so artlessly artful interludes werecondemned by the nature of the case to brevity he had fatallystamped himself it was his own fault a man who could beinterrupted with impunity the greatest of wonders moreover wasexactly in this that so interrupted a man should ever have got as the phrase was should above all have got so early to wherehe was

essential pulse of the flame the very action of the cerebraltemperature brought to the highest point yet extraordinarilycontained these facts themselves were the immensity of theresult they were one with perfection of machinery they hadconstituted the kind of acquisitive power engendered and applied the necessary triumph of all operations a dim explanation ofphenomena once vivid must at all events for the moment sufficeus it being obviously no account of the matter to throw on ourfriend s amiability alone the weight of the demonstration of hiseconomic history amiability of a truth is an aid to success it has even been known to be the principle of largeaccumulations but the link for the mind is none the lessfatally missing between proof on such a scale of continuity ifof nothing more insolent in one field and accessibility todistraction in every other variety of imagination what is thatbut fatal in the world of affairs unless so disciplined as notto be distinguished from monotony mr verver then for a fresh full period a period betraying extraordinarily no wasted year had been inscrutably monotonous behind an iridescent cloud thecloud was his native envelope the soft looseness so to say ofhis temper and tone not directly expressive enough no doubt tofigure an amplitude of folds but of a quality unmistakable forsensitive feelers he was still reduced in fine to getting hisrare moments with himself by feigning a cynicism his realinability to maintain the pretence however had perhaps notoften been better instanced than by his acceptance of theinevitable to day his acceptance of it on the arrival at theend of a quarter of an hour of that element of obligation withwhich he had all the while known he must reckon a quarter of an hour of egoism was about as much as he taking one situation withanother usually got mrs rance opened the door moretentatively indeed than he himself had just done but on theother hand as if to make up for this she pushed forward evenmore briskly on seeing him than he had been moved to do on seeingnobody then with force it came home to him that he had definitely a week before established a precedent he did her atleast that justice it was a kind of justice he was always doingsomeone he had on the previous sunday liked to stop at home andhe had exposed himself thereby to be caught in the act to makethis possible that is mrs rance had only had to like to do thesame the trick was so easily played it had not occurred to himto plan in any way for her absence which would have destroyed somehow in principle the propriety of his own presence ifpersons under his roof hadn t a right not to go to church whatbecame for a fair mind of his own right his subtlest manoeuvrehad been simply to change from the library to the billiard room it being in the library that his guest or his daughter s or theguest of the miss lutches he scarce knew in which light toregard her had then and not unnaturally of course joined him it was urged on him by his memory of the duration of the visitshe had that time as it were paid him that the law ofrecurrence would already have got itself enacted she had spentthe whole morning with him was still there in the library whenthe others came back thanks to her having been tepid about theirtaking mr verver and she a turn outside it had been as if shelooked on that as a kind of subterfuge almost as a form ofdisloyalty yet what was it she had in mind what did she wish tomake of him beyond what she had already made a patient punctilious host mindful that she had originally arrived much asa stranger arrived not at all deliberately or yearninglyinvited so that one positively had her possiblesusceptibilities the more on one s conscience the miss lutches the sisters from the middle west were there as friends ofmaggie s friends of the earlier time but mrs rance was there or at least had primarily appeared only as a friend of the misslutches this lady herself was not of the middle west she rather insistedon it but of new jersey rhode island or delaware one of thesmallest and most intimate states he couldn t remember which though she insisted too on that it was not in him we may say itfor him to go so far as to wonder if their group were next to berecruited by some friend of her own and this partly because shehad struck him verily rather as wanting to get the miss lutchesthemselves away than to extend the actual circle and partly aswell as more essentially because such connection as he enjoyedwith the ironic question in general resided substantially less ina personal use of it than in the habit of seeing it as easy toothers he was so framed by nature as to be able to keep hisinconveniences separate from his resentments though indeed ifthe sum of these latter had at the most always been small thatwas doubtless in some degree a consequence of the fewness of theformer his greatest inconvenience he would have admitted hadhe analyzed was in finding it so taken for granted that as hehad money he had force it pressed upon him hard and all round assuredly this attribution of power everyone had need of one spower whereas one s own need at the best would have seemed tobe but some trick for not communicating it the effect of areserve so merely so meanly defensive would in most cases beyond question sufficiently discredit the cause wherefore though it was complicating to be perpetually treated as aninfinite agent the outrage was not the greatest of which a braveman might complain complaint besides was a luxury and hedreaded the imputation of greed the other the constantimputation that of being able to do would have no ground ifhe hadn t been to start with this was the point provablyluxurious his lips somehow were closed and by a springconnected moreover with the action of his eyes themselves thelatter showed him what he had done showed him where he had comeout quite at the top of his hill of difficulty the tall sharpspiral round which he had begun to wind his ascent at the age oftwenty and the apex of which was a platform looking down if onewould on the kingdoms of the earth and with standing room forbut half a dozen others his eyes in any case now saw mrs rance approach with aninstant failure to attach to the fact any grossness of avidity ofmrs rance s own or at least to descry any triumphant use evenfor the luridest impression of her intensity what was virtuallysupreme would be her vision of his having attempted by hisdesertion of the library to mislead her which in point of factbarely escaped being what he had designed it was not easy forhim in spite of accumulations fondly and funnily regarded as ofsystematic practice not now to be ashamed the one thingcomparatively easy would be to gloss over his course thebilliard room was not at the particular crisis either a naturalor a graceful place for the nominally main occupant of so large ahouse to retire to and this without prejudice either to thefact that his visitor wouldn t as he apprehended explicitlymake him a scene should she frankly denounce him for a sneak hewould simply go to pieces but he was after an instant notafraid of that wouldn t she rather as emphasising theircommunion accept and in a manner exploit the anomaly treat itperhaps as romantic or possibly even as comic show at leastthat they needn t mind even though the vast table draped inbrown holland thrust itself between them as an expanse of desertsand she couldn t cross the desert but she could and did beautifully get round it so that for him to convert it into anobstacle he would have had to cause himself as in some childishgame or unbecoming romp to be pursued to be genially hunted this last was a turn he was well aware the occasion should on noaccount take and there loomed before him for the mere moment the prospect of her fairly proposing that they should knock aboutthe balls that danger certainly it struck him he should managein some way to deal with why too for that matter had he needof defences material or other how was it a question of dangersreally to be called such the deep danger the only one that madehim as an idea positively turn cold would have been thepossibility of her seeking him in marriage of her bringing upbetween them that terrible issue here fortunately she waspowerless it being apparently so provable against her that shehad a husband in undiminished existence she had him it was true only in america only in texas innebraska in arizona or somewhere somewhere that at old fawnshouse in the county of kent scarcely counted as a definiteplace at all it showed somehow from afar as so lost soindistinct and illusory in the great alkali desert of cheapdivorce she had him even in bondage poor man had him incontempt had him in remembrance so imperfect as barely to assertitself but she had him none the less in existence unimpeached the miss lutches had seen him in the flesh as they had appearedeager to mention though when they were separately questionedtheir descriptions failed to tally he would be at the worst should it come to the worst mrs rance s difficulty and heserved therefore quite enough as the stout bulwark of anyoneelse this was in truth logic without a flaw yet it gave mr verver less comfort than it ought he feared not only danger hefeared the idea of danger or in other words feared hauntedly himself it was above all as a symbol that mrs rance actuallyrose before him a symbol of the supreme effort that he shouldhave sooner or later as he felt to make this effort would beto say no he lived in terror of having to he should be proposedto at a given moment it was only a question of time and then heshould have to do a thing that would be extremely disagreeable he almost wished on occasion that he wasn t so sure he would doit he knew himself however well enough not to doubt he knewcoldly quite bleakly where he would at the crisis draw theline it was maggie s marriage and maggie s finer happiness happy as he had supposed her before that had made thedifference he hadn t in the other time it now seemed to him had to think of such things they hadn t come up for him and itwas as if she positively had herself kept them down she hadonly been his child which she was indeed as much as ever butthere were sides on which she had protected him as if she weremore than a daughter she had done for him more than he knew much and blissfully as he always had known if she did atpresent more than ever through having what she called the changein his life to make up to him for his situation still all thesame kept pace with her activity his situation being simplythat there was more than ever to be done there had not yet been quite so much on all the showing assince their return from their twenty months in america as sincetheir settlement again in england experimental though it was and the consequent sense now quite established for him of adomestic air that had cleared and lightened producing theeffect for their common personal life of wider perspectives andlarge waiting spaces it was as if his son in law s presence even from before his becoming his son in law had somehow filledthe scene and blocked the future very richly and handsomely when all was said not at all inconveniently or in ways not tohave been desired inasmuch as though the prince his measure nowpractically taken was still pretty much the same big fact thesky had lifted the horizon receded the very foreground itselfexpanded quite to match him quite to keep everything incomfortable scale at first certainly their decent littleold time union maggie s and his own had resembled a good dealsome pleasant public square in the heart of an old city intowhich a great palladian church say something with a grandarchitectural front had suddenly been dropped so that the restof the place the space in front the way round outside to theeast end the margin of street and passage the quantity ofover arching heaven had been temporarily compromised not eventhen of a truth in a manner disconcerting given that is forthe critical or at least the intelligent eye the great styleof the facade and its high place in its class the phenomenonthat had since occurred whether originally to have beenpronounced calculable or not had not naturally been themiracle of a night but had taken place so gradually quietly easily that from this vantage of wide wooded fawns with itseighty rooms as they said with its spreading park with its acres and acres of garden and its majesty of artificial lake though that for a person so familiar with the great ones might be rather ridiculous no visibility of transition showed no violence of adjustment in retrospect emerged the palladianchurch was always there but the piazza took care of itself thesun stared down in his fulness the air circulated and thepublic not less the limit stood off the way round was easy theeast end was as fine in its fashion as the west and there werealso side doors for entrance between the two large monumental ornamental in their style as for all proper great churches bysome such process in fine had the prince for his father in law while remaining solidly a feature ceased to be at allominously a block mr verver it may further be mentioned had taken at no momentsufficient alarm to have kept in detail the record of hisreassurance but he would none the less not have been unable notreally have been indisposed to impart in confidence to the rightperson his notion of the history of the matter the rightperson it is equally distinct had not for this illumination been wanting but had been encountered in the form of fannyassingham not for the first time indeed admitted to hiscounsels and who would have doubtless at present in any case from plenitude of interest and with equal guarantees repeatedhis secret it all came then the great clearance from the oneprime fact that the prince by good fortune hadn t provedangular he clung to that description of his daughter s husbandas he often did to terms and phrases in the human the socialconnection that he had found for himself it was his way to havetimes of using these constantly as if they just then lighted theworld or his own path in it for him even when for some of hisinterlocutors they covered less ground it was true that withmrs assingham he never felt quite sure of the ground anythingcovered she disputed with him so little agreed with him somuch surrounded him with such systematic consideration suchpredetermined tenderness that it was almost which he had oncetold her in irritation as if she were nursing a sick baby hehad accused her of not taking him seriously and she hadreplied as from her it couldn t frighten him that she took himreligiously adoringly she had laughed again as she had laughedbefore on his producing for her that good right word about thehappy issue of his connection with the prince with an effect themore odd perhaps as she had not contested its value she couldn tof course however be at the best as much in love with hisdiscovery as he was himself he was so much so that he fairlyworked it to his own comfort came in fact sometimes nearpublicly pointing the moral of what might have occurred iffriction so to speak had occurred he pointed it frankly oneday to the personage in question mentioned to the prince theparticular justice he did him was even explicit as to the dangerthat in their remarkable relation they had thus escaped oh if he had been angular who could say what might then havehappened he spoke and it was the way he had spoken to mrs assingham too as if he grasped the facts without exception forwhich angularity stood it figured for him clearly as a final idea a conception of thelast vividness he might have been signifying by it the sharpcorners and hard edges all the stony pointedness the grandright geometry of his spreading palladian church just so he wasinsensible to no feature of the felicity of a contact that beguilingly almost confoundingly was a contact but withpractically yielding lines and curved surfaces you re round myboy he had said you re all you re variously andinexhaustibly round when you might by all the chances havebeen abominably square i m not sure for that matter he hadadded that you re not square in the general mass whetherabominably or not the abomination isn t a question for you reinveterately round that s what i mean in the detail it s thesort of thing in you that one feels or at least i do withone s hand say you had been formed all over in a lot of littlepyramidal lozenges like that wonderful side of the ducal palacein venice so lovely in a building but so damnable for rubbingagainst in a man and especially in a near relation i can seethem all from here each of them sticking out by itself all thearchitectural cut diamonds that would have scratched one s softersides one would have been scratched by diamonds doubtless theneatest way if one was to be scratched at all but one would havebeen more or less reduced to a hash as it is for living with you re a pure and perfect crystal i give you my idea i thinkyou ought to have it just as it has come to me the prince hadtaken the idea in his way for he was well accustomed by thistime to taking and nothing perhaps even could more haveconfirmed mr verver s account of his surface than the manner inwhich these golden drops evenly flowed over it they caught in nointerstice they gathered in no concavity the uniform smoothnessbetrayed the dew but by showing for the moment a richer tone theyoung man in other words unconfusedly smiled though indeed asif assenting from principle and habit to more than heunderstood he liked all signs that things were well but hecared rather less why they were in regard to the people among whom he had since his marriage beenliving the reasons they so frequently gave so much oftener thanhe had ever heard reasons given before remained on the whole theelement by which he most differed from them and his father in law and his wife were after all only first among the peopleamong whom he had been living he was never even yet sure of how at this that or the other point he would strike them they feltremarkably so often things he hadn t meant and missed not lessremarkably and not less often things he had he had fallenback on his general explanation we haven t the same values bywhich he understood the same measure of importance his curves apparently were important because they had been unexpected or still more unconceived whereas when one had always as in hisrelegated old world taken curves and in much greater quantitiestoo for granted one was no more surprised at the resultingfeasibility of intercourse than one was surprised at beingupstairs in a house that had a staircase he had in fact on thisoccasion disposed alertly enough of the subject of mr verver sapprobation the promptitude of his answer we may in fact wellsurmise had sprung not a little from a particular kindledremembrance this had given his acknowledgment its easiest turn oh if i m a crystal i m delighted that i m a perfect one for ibelieve that they sometimes have cracks and flaws in which casethey re to be had very cheap he had stopped short of theemphasis it would have given his joke to add that there had beencertainly no having him cheap and it was doubtless a mark of thegood taste practically reigning between them that mr verver hadnot on his side either taken up the opportunity it is thelatter s relation to such aspects however that now mostconcerns us and the bearing of his pleased view of this absenceof friction upon amerigo s character as a representative preciousobject representative precious objects great ancient picturesand other works of art fine eminent pieces in gold in silver in enamel majolica ivory bronze had for a number of years somultiplied themselves round him and as a general challenge toacquisition and appreciation so engaged all the faculties of hismind that the instinct the particular sharpened appetite of thecollector had fairly served as a basis for his acceptance of theprince s suit over and above the signal fact of the impression made on maggieherself the aspirant to his daughter s hand showed somehow thegreat marks and signs stood before him with the highauthenticities he had learned to look for in pieces of the firstorder adam verver knew by this time knew thoroughly no man ineurope or in america he privately believed was less capable insuch estimates of vulgar mistakes he had never spoken ofhimself as infallible it was not his way but apart from thenatural affections he had acquainted himself with no greaterjoy of the intimately personal type than the joy of hisoriginally coming to feel and all so unexpectedly that he hadin him the spirit of the connoisseur he had like many otherpersons in the course of his reading been struck with keats ssonnet about stout cortez in the presence of the pacific but fewpersons probably had so devoutly fitted the poet s grand imageto a fact of experience it consorted so with mr verver sconsciousness of the way in which at a given moment he hadstared at his pacific that a couple of perusals of the immortallines had sufficed to stamp them in his memory his peak indarien was the sudden hour that had transformed his life thehour of his perceiving with a mute inward gasp akin to the lowmoan of apprehensive passion that a world was left him toconquer and that he might conquer it if he tried it had been aturning of the page of the book of life as if a leaf long inerthad moved at a touch and eagerly reversed had made such a stirof the air as sent up into his face the very breath of the goldenisles to rifle the golden isles had on the spot become thebusiness of his future and with the sweetness of it what wasmost wondrous of all still more even in the thought than in theact the thought was that of the affinity of genius or at leastof taste with something in himself with the dormantintelligence of which he had thus almost violently become awareand that affected him as changing by a mere revolution of thescrew his whole intellectual plane he was equal somehow withthe great seers the invokers and encouragers of beauty and hedidn t after all perhaps dangle so far below the great producersand creators he had been nothing of that kind before toodecidedly too dreadfully not but now he saw why he had beenwhat he had why he had failed and fallen short even in hugesuccess now he read into his career in one single magnificentnight the immense meaning it had waited for it was during his first visit to europe after the death of hiswife when his daughter was ten years old that the light in hismind had so broken and he had even made out at that time why on an earlier occasion the journey of his honeymoon year it hadstill been closely covered he had bought then so far as hehad been able but he had bought almost wholly for the frail fluttered creature at his side who had had her fancies decidedly but all for the art then wonderful to both of them of the rue de la paix the costly authenticities of dressmakersand jewellers her flutter pale disconcerted ghost as sheactually was a broken white flower tied round almostgrotesquely for his present sense with a huge satin bow of theboulevard her flutter had been mainly that of ribbons frillsand fine fabrics all funny pathetic evidence for memory ofthe bewilderments overtaking them as a bridal pair confrontedwith opportunity he could wince fairly still as he rememberedthe sense in which the poor girl s pressure had under his fondencouragement indeed been exerted in favour of purchase andcuriosity these were wandering images out of the earlier dusk that threw her back for his pity into a past more remote thanhe liked their common past their young affection to appear it would have had to be admitted to an insistent criticism thatmaggie s mother all too strangely had not so much failed offaith as of the right application of it since she had exercisedit eagerly and restlessly made it a pretext for innocentperversities in respect to which philosophic time was at last toreduce all groans to gentleness and they had loved each other sothat his own intelligence on the higher line had temporarilypaid for it the futilities the enormities the depravities ofdecoration and ingenuity that before his sense was unsealed she had made him think lovely musing reconsidering little manthat he was and addicted to silent pleasures as he wasaccessible to silent pains he even sometimes wondered what wouldhave become of his intelligence in the sphere in which it was tolearn more and more exclusively to play if his wife s influenceupon it had not been in the strange scheme of things sopromptly removed would she have led him altogether attached ashe was to her into the wilderness of mere mistakes would shehave prevented him from ever scaling his vertiginous peak orwould she otherwise have been able to accompany him to thateminence where he might have pointed out to her as cortez tohis companions the revelation vouchsafed no companion of cortezhad presumably been a real lady mr verver allowed that historicfact to determine his inference viiiwhat was at all events not permanently hidden from him was atruth much less invidious about his years of darkness it was thestrange scheme of things again the years of darkness had beenneeded to render possible the years of light a wiser hand thanhe at first knew had kept him hard at acquisition of one sort asa perfect preliminary to acquisition of another and thepreliminary would have been weak and wanting if the good faith ofit had been less his comparative blindness had made the goodfaith which in its turn had made the soil propitious for theflower of the supreme idea he had had to like forging andsweating he had had to like polishing and piling up his arms they were things at least he had had to believe he liked just ashe had believed he liked transcendent calculation and imaginativegambling all for themselves the creation of interests thatwere the extinction of other interests the livid vulgarity even of getting in or getting out first that had of coursebeen so far from really the case with the supreme idea all thewhile growing and striking deep under everything in the warm rich earth he had stood unknowing he had walked and workedwhere it was buried and the fact itself the fact of hisfortune would have been a barren fact enough if the first sharptender shoot had never struggled into day there on one side wasthe ugliness his middle time had been spared there on the other from all the portents was the beauty with which his age mightstill be crowned he was happier doubtless than he deserved but that when one was happy at all it was easy to be he hadwrought by devious ways but he had reached the place and whatwould ever have been straighter in any man s life

greek temple wascompact a receptacle of treasures sifted to positive sanctity his spirit to day almost altogether lived making up as he wouldhave said for lost time and haunting the portico in

he liked to mark that he needed on the matter in question instruction from no one on earth acouple of years of europe again of renewed nearness to changesand chances refreshed sensibility to the currents of the market would fall in with the consistency of wisdom the particularshade of enlightened conviction that he wished to observe itdidn t look like much for a whole family to hang about waiting they being now since the birth of his grandson a whole family and there was henceforth only one ground in all the world hefelt on which the question of appearance would ever really againcount for him he cared that a work of art of price should looklike the master to whom it might perhaps be deceitfullyattributed but he had ceased on the whole to know any matter ofthe rest of life by its looks he took life in general higher up the stream so far as he wasnot actually taking it as a collector he was taking it decidedly as a grandfather in the way of precious small pieceshe had handled nothing so precious as the principino hisdaughter s first born whose italian designation endlessly amusedhim and whom he could manipulate and dandle already almost tossand catch again as he couldn t a correspondingly rare morsel ofan earlier pate tendre he could take the small clutching childfrom his nurse s arms with an iteration grimly discountenanced in respect to their contents by the glass doors of highcabinets something clearly beatific in this new relation had moreover without doubt confirmed for him the sense that none ofhis silent answers to public detraction to local vulgarity hadever been so legitimately straight as the mere element ofattitude reduce it he said to that in his easy weeks atfawns the element of attitude was all he wanted of these weeks and he was enjoying it on the spot even more than he had hoped enjoying it in spite of mrs rance and the miss lutches in spiteof the small worry of his belief that fanny assingham had reallysomething for him that she was keeping back in spite of his fullconsciousness overflowing the cup like a wine too generouslypoured that if he had consented to marry his daughter andthereby to make as it were the difference what surrounded himnow was exactly consent vivified marriage demonstrated thedifference in fine definitely made he could call back hisprior his own wedded consciousness it was not yet out of rangeof vague reflection he had supposed himself above all he hadsupposed his wife as married as anyone could be and yet hewondered if their state had deserved the name or their unionworn the beauty in the degree to which the couple now before himcarried the matter in especial since the birth of their boy innew york the grand climax of their recent american period brought to so right an issue the happy pair struck him as havingcarried it higher deeper further to where it ceased to concernhis imagination at any rate to follow them extraordinary beyond question was one branch of his characteristic mutewonderment it characterised above all with its subject beforeit his modesty the strange dim doubt waking up for him at theend of the years of whether maggie s mother had after all beencapable of the maximum the maximum of tenderness he meant asthe terms existed for him the maximum of immersion in the factof being married maggie herself was capable maggie herself atthis season was exquisitely divinely the maximum such wasthe impression that positively holding off a little for thepractical the tactful consideration it inspired in him arespect for the beauty and sanctity of it almost amounting to awe such was the impression he daily received from her she was hermother oh yes but her mother and something more it becomingthus a new light for him and in such a curious way too thatanything more than her mother should prove at this time of daypossible he could live over again at almost any quiet moment the longprocess of his introduction to his present interests anintroduction that had depended all on himself like the cheek of the young man who approaches a boss without credentials orpicks up an acquaintance makes even a real friend by speakingto a passer in the street his real friend in all the business was to have been his own mind with which nobody had put him inrelation he had knocked at the door of that essentially privatehouse and his call in truth had not been immediately answered so that when after waiting and coming back he had at last gotin it was twirling his hat as an embarrassed stranger or trying his keys as a thief at night he had gained confidenceonly with time but when he had taken real possession of theplace it had been never again to come away all of which successrepresented it must be allowed his one principle of pride pride in the mere original spring pride in his money would havebeen pride in something that had come in comparison so easily the right ground for elation was difficulty mastered and hisdifficulty thanks to his modesty had been to believe in hisfacility this was the problem he had worked out to itssolution the solution that was now doing more than all else tomake his feet settle and his days flush and when he wished tofeel good as they said at american city he had but to retracehis immense development that was what the whole thing came backto that the development had not been somebody s else passingfalsely accepted too ignobly for his to think how servile hemight have been was absolutely to respect himself was in fact as much as he liked to admire himself as free the very finestspring that ever responded to his touch was always there topress the memory of his freedom as dawning upon him like asunrise all pink and silver during a winter divided betweenflorence rome and naples some three years after his wife sdeath it was the hushed daybreak of the roman revelation inparticular that he could usually best recover with the way thatthere above all where the princes and popes had been beforehim his divination of his faculty most went to his head he wasa plain american citizen staying at an hotel where sometimes for days together there were twenty others like him but nopope no prince of them all had read a richer meaning hebelieved into the character of the patron of art he was ashamedof them really if he wasn t afraid and he had on the wholenever so climbed to the tip top as in judging over a perusal ofhermann grimm where julius ii and leo x were placed by theirtreatment of michael angelo far below the plain americancitizen in the case at least in which this personage happenednot to be too plain to be adam verver going to our friend shead moreover some of the results of such comparisons maydoubtless be described as having stayed there his freedom tosee of which the comparisons were part what could it do butsteadily grow and grow it came perhaps even too much to stand to him for all freedom since for example it was as much there as ever at the very timeof mrs rance s conspiring against him at fawns with thebilliard room and the sunday morning on the occasion round whichwe have perhaps drawn our circle too wide mrs rance at leastcontrolled practically each other license of the present and thenear future the license to pass the hour as he would have foundconvenient the license to stop remembering for a little that though if proposed to and not only by this aspirant but by anyother he wouldn t prove foolish the proof of wisdom was nonethe less in such a fashion rather cruelly conditioned thelicense in especial to proceed from his letters to his journalsand insulate orientate himself afresh by the sound over hisgained interval of the many mouthed monster the exercise ofwhose lungs he so constantly stimulated mrs rance remained withhim till the others came back from church and it was by thattime clearer than ever that his ordeal when it should arrive would be really most unpleasant his impression this was thepoint took somehow the form not so much of her wanting to presshome her own advantage as of her building better than she knew that is of her symbolising with virtual unconsciousness his ownspecial deficiency his unfortunate lack of a wife to whomapplications could be referred the applications thecontingencies with which mrs rance struck him as potentiallybristling were not of a sort really to be met by one s self and the possibility of them when his visitor said or as good assaid i m restrained you see because of mr rance and alsobecause i m proud and refined but if it wasn t for mr rance andfor my refinement and my pride the possibility of them i say turned to a great murmurous rustle of a volume to fill thefuture a rustle of petticoats of scented many paged letters of voices as to which distinguish themselves as they might fromeach other it mattered little in what part of the resoundingcountry they had learned to make themselves prevail theassinghams and the miss lutches had taken the walk through thepark to the little old church on the property that ourfriend had often found himself wishing he were able to transport as it stood for its simple sweetness in a glass case to one ofhis exhibitory halls while maggie had induced her husband notinveterate in such practices to make with her by carriage thesomewhat longer pilgrimage to the nearest altar modest though ithappened to be of the faith her own as it had been hermother s and as mr verver himself had been loosely willing always to let it be taken for his without the solid ease ofwhich making the stage firm and smooth the drama of hermarriage might not have been acted out what at last appeared to have happened however was that thedivided parties coming back at the same moment had met outsideand then drifted together from empty room to room yet not inmere aimless quest of the pair of companions they had left athome the quest had carried them to the door of the billiard room and their appearance as it opened to admit them determined for adam verver in the oddest way in the world a newand sharp perception it was really remarkable this perceptionexpanded on the spot as a flower one of the strangest might at a breath have suddenly opened the breath for that matter was more than anything else the look in his daughter s eyes thelook with which he saw her take in exactly what had occurred inher absence mrs rance s pursuit of him to this remote locality the spirit and the very form perfectly characteristic of hisacceptance of the complication the seal set in short unmistakably on one of maggie s anxieties the anxiety it wastrue would have been even though not imparted separatelyshared for fanny assingham s face was by the same stroke notat all thickly veiled for him and a queer light of a colourquite to match fairly glittered in the four fine eyes of themiss lutches each of these persons counting out that is theprince and the colonel who didn t care and who didn t even seethat the others did knew something or had at any rate had heridea the idea precisely that this was what mrs rance artfully biding her time would do the special shade ofapprehension on the part of the miss lutches might indeed havesuggested the vision of an energy supremely asserted it wasdroll in truth if one came to that the position of the misslutches they had themselves brought they had guilelesslyintroduced mrs rance strong in the fact of mr rance s havingbeen literally beheld of them and it was now for them positively as if their handful of flowers since mrs rance wasa handful had been but the vehicle of a dangerous snake mr verver fairly felt in the air the miss lutches imputation inthe intensity of which really his own propriety might have beeninvolved that none the less was but a flicker what made the realdifference as i have hinted was his mute passage with maggie his daughter s anxiety alone had depths and it opened out forhim the wider that it was altogether new when in their commonpast when till this moment had she shown a fear howeverdumbly for his individual life they had had fears together just as they had had joys but all of hers at least had beenfor what equally concerned them here of a sudden was a questionthat concerned him alone and the soundless explosion of itsomehow marked a date he was on her mind he was even in amanner on her hands as a distinct thing that is from being where he had always been merely deep in her heart and in herlife too deep down as it were to be disengaged contrasted oropposed in short objectively presented but time finally haddone it their relation was altered he saw again thedifference lighted for her this marked it to himself and itwasn t a question simply of a mrs rance the more or the less for maggie too at a stroke almost beneficently their visitorhad from being an inconvenience become a sign they had madevacant by their marriage his immediate foreground his personalprecinct they being the princess and the prince they had maderoom in it for others so others had become aware he becameaware himself for that matter during the minute maggie stoodthere before speaking and with the sense moreover of what hesaw her see he had the sense of what she saw him this last itmay be added would have been his intensest perception had therenot the next instant been more for him in fanny assingham herface couldn t keep it from him she had seen on top ofeverything in her quick way what they both were seeing ixso much mute communication was doubtless all this time marvellous and we may confess to having perhaps read into thescene prematurely a critical character that took longer todevelop yet the quiet hour of reunion enjoyed that afternoon bythe father and the daughter did really little else than deal withthe elements definitely presented to each in the vibrationproduced by the return of the church goers nothing allusive nothing at all insistent passed between them either before orimmediately after luncheon except indeed so far as their failuresoon again to meet might be itself an accident charged withreference the hour or two after luncheon and on sundays withespecial rigour for one of the domestic reasons of which itbelonged to maggie quite multitudinously to take account werehabitually spent by the princess with her little boy in whoseapartment she either frequently found her father alreadyestablished or was sooner or later joined by him his visit tohis grandson at some hour or other held its place in his day against all interventions and this without counting hisgrandson s visits to him scarcely less ordered and timed andthe odd bits as he called them that they picked up togetherwhen they could communions snatched for the most part on theterrace in the gardens or the park while the principino withmuch pomp and circumstance of perambulator parasol fine laceover veiling and incorruptible female attendance took the air in the private apartments which occupying in the great housethe larger part of a wing of their own were not much more easilyaccessible than if the place had been a royal palace and thesmall child an heir apparent in the nursery of nurseries thetalk at these instituted times was always so prevailingly withor about the master of the scene that other interests and othertopics had fairly learned to avoid the slighting and inadequatenotice there taken of them they came in at the best but asinvolved in the little boy s future his past or hiscomprehensive present never getting so much as a chance to pleadtheir own merits or to complain of being neglected nothingperhaps in truth had done more than this united participationto confirm in the elder parties that sense of a life not onlyuninterrupted but more deeply associated more largely combined of which on adam verver s behalf we have made some mention itwas of course an old story and a familiar idea that a beautifulbaby could take its place as a new link between a wife and ahusband but maggie and her father had with every ingenuity converted the precious creature into a link between a mamma and agrandpapa the principino for a chance spectator of thisprocess might have become by an untoward stroke a haplesshalf orphan with the place of immediate male parent swept bareand open to the next nearest sympathy they had no occasion thus the conjoined worshippers to talk ofwhat the prince might be or might do for his son the sum ofservice in his absence so completely filled itself out it wasnot in the least moreover that there was doubt of him for hewas conspicuously addicted to the manipulation of the child inthe frank italian way at such moments as he judged discreet inrespect to other claims conspicuously indeed that is formaggie who had more occasion on the whole to speak to herhusband of the extravagance of her father than to speak to herfather of the extravagance of her husband adam verver had allround in this connection his own serenity he was sure of hisson in law s auxiliary admiration admiration he meant of hisgrand son since to begin with what else had been at work butthe instinct or it might fairly have been the tradition of thelatter s making the child so solidly beautiful as to have to beadmired what contributed most to harmony in this play ofrelations however was the way the young man seemed to leave itto be gathered that tradition for tradition the grandpapa s ownwas not in any estimate to go for nothing a tradition orwhatever it was that had flowered prelusively in the princessherself well amerigo s very discretions were his way of takingaccount of it his discriminations in respect to his heir were in fine not more angular than any others to be observed in him and mr verver received perhaps from no source so distinct animpression of being for him an odd and important phenomenon as hereceived from this impunity of appropriation these unchallengednursery hours it was as if the grandpapa s special show of thecharacter were but another side for the observer to study another item for him to note it came back this latter personageknew to his own previous perception that of the prince sinability in any matter in which he was concerned to conclude the idiosyncrasy for him at each stage had to bedemonstrated on which however he admirably accepted it thislast was after all the point he really worked poor young man for acceptance since he worked so constantly for comprehension and how when you came to that could you know that a horsewouldn t shy at a brass band in a country road because itdidn t shy at a traction engine it might have been brought up totraction engines without having been brought up to brass bands little by little thus from month to month the prince waslearning what his wife s father had been brought up to and nowit could be checked off he had been brought up to the romanticview of principini who would have thought it and where would itall stop the only fear somewhat sharp for mr verver was acertain fear of disappointing him for strangeness he felt thatthe evidence he offered thus viewed was too much on thepositive side he didn t know he was learning and it was funnyfor him to how many things he had been brought up if the princecould only strike something to which he hadn t this wouldn t itseemed to him ruffle the smoothness and yet might a little add to the interest what was now clear at all events for the father and thedaughter was their simply knowing they wanted for the time tobe together at any cost as it were and their necessity soworked in them as to bear them out of the house in a quarterhidden from that in which their friends were gathered and causethem to wander unseen unfollowed along a covered walk in the old garden as it was called old with an antiquity of formalthings high box and shaped yew and expanses of brick wall thathad turned at once to purple and to pink they went out of a doorin the wall a door that had a slab with a date set above it but in the old multiplied lettering and then had beforethem a small white gate intensely white and clean amid all thegreenness through which they gradually passed to where some ofthe grandest trees spaciously clustered and where they would findone of the quietest places a bench had been placed long ago beneath a great oak that helped to crown a mild eminence and theground sank away below it to rise again opposite at a distancesufficient to enclose the solitude and figure a bosky horizon summer blissfully was with them yet and the low sun made asplash of light where it pierced the looser shade maggie comingdown to go out had brought a parasol which as over hercharming bare head she now handled it gave with the big strawhat that her father in these days always wore a good deal tippedback definite intention to their walk they knew the bench itwas sequestered they had praised it for that together before and liked the word and after they had begun to linger there theycould have smiled if they hadn t been really too serious and ifthe question hadn t so soon ceased to matter over the probablewonder of the others as to what would have become of them the extent to which they enjoyed their indifference to anyjudgment of their want of ceremony what did that of itself speakbut for the way that as a rule they almost equally had otherson their mind they each knew that both were full of thesuperstition of not hurting but might precisely have beenasking themselves asking in fact each other at this moment whether that was to be after all the last word of theirconscientious development certain it was at all events that in addition to the assinghams and the lutches and mrs rance theattendance at tea just in the right place on the west terrace might perfectly comprise the four or five persons among them thevery pretty the typically irish miss maddock vaunted announcedand now brought from the couple of other houses near enough oneof these the minor residence of their proprietor established thriftily while he hired out his ancestral home within sightand sense of his profit it was not less certain either that for once in a way the group in question must all take the caseas they found it fanny assingham at any time for that matter might perfectly be trusted to see mr verver and his daughter tosee their reputation for a decent friendliness through anymomentary danger might be trusted even to carry off theirabsence for amerigo for amerigo s possible funny italiananxiety amerigo always being as the princess was well aware conveniently amenable to this friend s explanations beguilements reassurances and perhaps in fact rather more thanless dependent on them as his new life since that was his ownname for it opened out it was no secret to maggie it wasindeed positively a public joke for her that she couldn texplain as mrs assingham did and that the prince likingexplanations liking them almost as if he collected them in themanner of book plates or postage stamps for themselves hisrequisition of this luxury had to be met he didn t seem to wantthem as yet for use rather for ornament and amusement innocentamusement of the kind he most fancied and that was socharacteristic of his blessed beautiful general slightlyindolent lack of more dissipated or even just of moresophisticated tastes however that might be the dear woman had come to be frankly andgaily recognised and not least by herself as filling in theintimate little circle an office that was not always a sinecure it was almost as if she had taken with her kind melancholycolonel at her heels a responsible engagement to be withincall as it were for all those appeals that sprang out of talk that sprang not a little doubtless too out of leisure itnaturally led her position in the household as she called it to considerable frequency of presence to visits from the goodcouple freely repeated and prolonged and not so much as underform of protest she was there to keep him quiet it wasamerigo s own description of her influence and it would onlyhave needed a more visible disposition to unrest in himto make the account perfectly fit fanny herself limited indeed she minimised her office you didn t need a jailor shecontended for a domesticated lamb tied up with pink ribbon thiswas not an animal to be controlled it was an animal to be atthe most educated she admitted accordingly that she waseducative which maggie was so aware that she herself inevitably wasn t so it came round to being true that what shewas most in charge of was his mere intelligence this left goodness knew plenty of different calls for maggie to meet in acase in which so much pink ribbon as it might be symbolicallynamed was lavished on the creature what it all amounted to atany rate was that mrs assingham would be keeping him quiet now while his wife and his father in law carried out their own littlefrugal picnic quite moreover doubtless not much less neededlyin respect to the members of the circle that were with them therethan in respect to the pair they were missing almost for thefirst time it was present to maggie that the prince could bear when he was with his wife almost any queerness on the part ofpeople strange english types who bored him beyond convenience by being so little as he himself was for this was one of theways in which a wife was practically sustaining but she was aspositively aware that she hadn t yet learned to see him asmeeting such exposure in her absence how did he move and talk how above all did he or how would he look he who with his sonobly handsome face could look such wonderful things in case ofbeing left alone with some of the subjects of his wonder therewere subjects for wonder among these very neighbours only maggieherself had her own odd way which didn t moreover the leastirritate him of really liking them in proportion as they couldstrike her as strange it came out in her by heredity he amusedhimself with declaring this love of chinoiseries but sheactually this evening didn t mind he might deal with her chineseas he could maggie indeed would always have had for such moments had theyoftener occurred the impression made on her by a word of mrs assingham s a word referring precisely to that appetite inamerigo for the explanatory which we have just found in our path it wasn t that the princess could be indebted to another person even to so clever a one as this friend for seeing anything inher husband that she mightn t see unaided but she had ever hitherto been of a nature to accept with modest gratitude anybetter description of a felt truth than her little limits terribly marked she knew in the direction of saying the rightthings enabled her to make thus it was at any rate that shewas able to live more or less in the light of the fact expressedso lucidly by their common comforter the fact that the princewas saving up for some very mysterious but very fine eventualpurpose all the wisdom all the answers to his questions allthe impressions and generalisations he gathered putting themaway and packing them down because he wanted his great gun to beloaded to the brim on the day he should decide to let it off hewanted first to make sure of the whole of the subject that wasunrolling itself before him after which the innumerable facts hehad collected would find their use he knew what he was about trust him at last therefore to make and to some effect his bignoise and mrs assingham had repeated that he knew what he wasabout it was the happy form of this assurance that had remainedwith maggie it could always come in for her that amerigo knewwhat he was about he might at moments seem vague seem absent seem even bored this when away from her father with whom itwas impossible for him to appear anything but respectfullyoccupied he let his native gaiety go in outbreaks of song oreven of quite whimsical senseless sound either expressive ofintimate relaxation or else fantastically plaintive he might attimes reflect with the frankest lucidity on the circumstance thatthe case was for a good while yet absolutely settled in regard towhat he still had left at home of his very own in regard tothe main seat of his affection the house in rome the big blackpalace the palazzo nero as he was fond of naming it and alsoon the question of the villa in the sabine hills which she had at the time of their engagement seen and yearned over and thecastello proper described by him always as the perched place that had as she knew formerly stood up on the pedestal of itsmountain slope showing beautifully blue from afar as the headand front of the princedom he might rejoice in certain moodsover the so long estranged state of these properties not indeedall irreclaimably alienated but encumbered with unending leasesand charges with obstinate occupants with impossibilities ofuse all without counting the cloud of mortgages that had fromfar back buried them beneath the ashes of rage and remorse ashroud as thick as the layer once resting on the towns at thefoot of vesuvius and actually making of any present restorativeeffort a process much akin to slow excavation just so he mightwith another turn of his humour almost wail for these brightestspots of his lost paradise declaring that he was an idiot not tobe able to bring himself to face the sacrifices sacrificesresting if definitely anywhere with mr verver necessary forwinning them back one of the most comfortable things between the husband and thewife meanwhile one of those easy certitudes they could be merelygay about was that she never admired him so much or so foundhim heartbreakingly handsome clever irresistible in the verydegree in which he had originally and fatally dawned upon her aswhen she saw other women reduced to the same passive pulp thathad then begun once for all to constitute her substance therewas really nothing they had talked of together with more intimateand familiar pleasantry than of the license and privilege theboundless happy margin thus established for each she going sofar as to put it that even should he some day get drunk and beather the spectacle of him with hated rivals would after nomatter what extremity always for the sovereign charm of it charm of it in itself and as the exhibition of him that mostdeeply moved her suffice to bring her round what wouldtherefore be more open to him than to keep her in love with him he agreed with all his heart at these light moments that hiscourse wouldn t then be difficult inasmuch as so simplyconstituted as he was on all the precious question and whyshould he be ashamed of it he knew but one way with the fair they had to be fair and he was fastidious and particular hisstandard was high but when once this was the case what relationwith them was conceivable what relation was decent rudimentary properly human but that of a plain interest in the fairness hisinterest she always answered happened not to be plain andplainness all round had little to do with the matter which wasmarked on the contrary by the richest variety of colour butthe working basis at all events had been settled the missmaddocks of life been assured of their importance for him howconveniently assured maggie to take him too into the joke hadmore than once gone so far as to mention to her father since itfell in easily with the tenderness of her disposition to remembershe might occasionally make him happy by an intimate confidence this was one of her rules full as she was of little rules considerations provisions there were things she of coursecouldn t tell him in so many words about amerigo and herself andabout their happiness and their union and their deepest depths andthere were other things she needn t but there were also thosethat were both true and amusing both communicable and real andof these with her so conscious so delicately cultivated schemeof conduct as a daughter she could make her profit at will a pleasant hush for that matter had fallen on most of theelements while she lingered apart with her companion itinvolved this serenity innumerable complete assumptions sinceso ordered and so splendid a rest all the tokens spreadingabout them of confidence solidly supported might have suggestedfor persons of poorer pitch the very insolence of facility still they weren t insolent they weren t our pair couldreflect they were only blissful and grateful and personallymodest not ashamed of knowing with competence when greatthings were great when good things were good and when safethings were safe and not therefore placed below their fortuneby timidity which would have been as bad as being below it byimpudence worthy of it as they were and as each appears underour last possible analysis to have wished to make the other feelthat they were what they most finally exhaled into the eveningair as their eyes mildly met may well have been a kind ofhelplessness in their felicity their rightness thejustification of everything something they so felt the pulseof sat there with them but they might have been askingthemselves a little blankly to what further use they couldput anything so perfect they had created and nursed andestablished it they had housed it here in dignity and crowned itwith comfort but mightn t the moment possibly count for them orcount at least for us while we watch them with their fate allbefore them as the dawn of the discovery that it doesn t alwaysmeet all contingencies to be right otherwise why should maggiehave found a word of definite doubt the expression of the finepang determined in her a few hours before rise after a time toher lips she took so for granted moreover her companion sintelligence of her doubt that the mere vagueness of her questioncould say it all what is it after all that they want to do toyou they were for the princess too the hovering forces ofwhich mrs rance was the symbol and her father only smilingback now at his ease took no trouble to appear not to know whatshe meant what she meant when once she had spoken could comeout well enough though indeed it was nothing after they hadcome to the point that could serve as ground for a greatdefensive campaign the waters of talk spread a little andmaggie presently contributed an idea in saying what has reallyhappened is that the proportions for us are altered heaccepted equally for the time this somewhat cryptic remark hestill failed to challenge her even when she added that itwouldn t so much matter if he hadn t been so terribly young heuttered a sound of protest only when she went to declare that sheought as a daughter in common decency to have waited yet bythat time she was already herself admitting that she should havehad to wait long if she waited that is till he was old butthere was a way since you are an irresistible youth we ve gotto face it that somehow is what that woman has made me feel there ll be others xto talk of it thus appeared at last a positive relief to him yes there ll be others but you ll see me through she hesitated do you mean if you give in oh no through my holding out maggie waited again but when she spoke it had an effect ofabruptness why should you hold out forever he gave none the less no start and this as from the habit oftaking anything taking everything from her as harmonious butit was quite written upon him too for that matter that holdingout wouldn t be so very completely his natural or at any ratehis acquired form his appearance would have testified that hemight have to do so a long time for a man so greatly beset thisappearance that is spoke but little as yet of shortremainders and simplified senses and all in spite of his being asmall spare slightly stale person deprived of the generalprerogative of presence it was not by mass or weight or vulgarimmediate quantity that he would in the future any more than hehad done in the past insist or resist or prevail there was evensomething in him that made his position on any occasion madehis relation to any scene or to any group a matter of the backof the stage of an almost visibly conscious want of

small decent room clean swept and unencumbered withfurniture but drawing a particular advantage as might presentlybe noted from the outlook of a pair of ample and uncurtainedwindows there was something in adam verver s eyes that bothadmitted the morning and the evening in unusual quantities andgave the modest area the outward extension of a view that was big even when restricted to stars

about her i guess i don t feel as if youhad moved very far you ve only moved next door well she continued i don t feel as if it were fair for mejust to have given you a push and left you so if i ve made thedifference for you i must think of the difference then what darling he indulgently asked do you think that s just what i don t yet know but i must find out we mustthink together as we ve always thought what i mean she wenton after a moment is that it strikes me that i ought to atleast offer you some alternative i ought to have worked one outfor you an alternative to what well to your simply missing what you ve lost without anythingbeing done about it but what have i lost she thought a minute as if it were difficult to say yet as ifshe more and more saw it well whatever it was that before kept us from thinking and kept you really as you might say inthe market it was as if you couldn t be in the market when youwere married to me or rather as if i kept people off innocently by being married to you now that i m married to someone else you re as in consequence married to nobody thereforeyou may be married to anybody to everybody people don t see whyyou shouldn t be married to them isn t it enough of a reason he mildly inquired that i don twant to be it s enough of a reason yes but to be enough of a reason ithas to be too much of a trouble i mean for you it has to be toomuch of a fight you ask me what you ve lost maggie continuedto explain the not having to take the trouble and to make thefight that s what you ve lost the advantage the happiness ofbeing just as you were because i was just as i was that swhat you miss so that you think her father presently said that i hadbetter get married just in order to be as i was before the detached tone of it detached as if innocently to amuse herby showing his desire to accommodate was so far successful as todraw from her gravity a short light laugh well what i don twant you to feel is that if you were to i shouldn t understand ishould understand that s all said the princess gently her companion turned it pleasantly over you don t go so far asto wish me to take somebody i don t like ah father she sighed you know how far i go how far i couldgo but i only wish that if you ever should like anybody you maynever doubt of my feeling how i ve brought you to it you llalways know that i know that it s my fault you mean he went on in his contemplative way that it will beyou who ll take the consequences maggie just considered i ll leave you all the good ones buti ll take the bad well that s handsome he emphasised his sense of it by drawingher closer and holding her more tenderly it s about all i couldexpect of you so far as you ve wronged me therefore we ll callit square i ll let you know in time if i see a prospect of yourhaving to take it up but am i to understand meanwhile he soonwent on that ready as you are to see me through my collapse you re not ready or not as ready to see me through myresistance i ve got to be a regular martyr before you ll beinspired she demurred at his way of putting it why if you like it youknow it won t be a collapse then why talk about seeing me through at all i shall onlycollapse if i do like it but what i seem to feel is that i don twant to like it that is he amended unless i feel surer i dothan appears very probable i don t want to have to think i likeit in a case when i really shan t i ve had to do that in somecases he confessed when it has been a question of otherthings i don t want he wound up to be made to make amistake ah but it s too dreadful she returned that you should evenhave to fear or just nervously to dream that you may be whatdoes that show after all she asked but that you do really well within feel a want what does it show but that you re trulysusceptible well it may show that he defended himself against nothing but it shows also i think that charming women are in the kindof life we re leading now numerous and formidable maggie entertained for a moment the proposition under cover ofwhich however she passed quickly from the general to theparticular do you feel mrs rance to be charming well i feel her to be formidable when they cast a spell itcomes to the same thing i think she d do anything oh well i d help you the princess said with decision asagainst her if that s all you require it s too funny she wenton before he again spoke that mrs rance should be here at all but if you talk of the life we lead much of it is altogether i m bound to say too funny the thing is maggie developedunder this impression that i don t think we lead as regardsother people any life at all we don t at any rate it seems tome lead half the life we might and so it seems i think toamerigo so it seems also i m sure to fanny assingham mr verver as if from due regard for these persons considered alittle what life would they like us to lead oh it s not a question i think on which they quite feeltogether she thinks dear fanny that we ought to be greater greater he echoed it vaguely and amerigo too you say ah yes her reply was prompt but amerigo doesn t mind hedoesn t care i mean what we do it s for us he considers tosee things exactly as we wish fanny herself maggie pursued thinks he s magnificent magnificent i mean for takingeverything as it is for accepting the social limitations ofour life for not missing what we don t give him mr verver attended then if he doesn t miss it his magnificenceis easy it is easy that s exactly what i think if there were things hedid miss and if in spite of them he were always sweet then nodoubt he would be a more or less unappreciated hero he could bea hero he will be one if it s ever necessary but it will beabout something better than our dreariness i know theprincess declared where he s magnificent and she rested aminute on that she ended however as she had begun we re not all the same committed to anything stupid if we ought to begrander as fanny thinks we can be grander there s nothing toprevent is it a strict moral obligation adam verver inquired no it s for the amusement for whose for fanny s own for everyone s though i dare say fanny s would be a largepart she hesitated she had now it might have appeared something more to bring out which she finally produced foryours in particular say if you go into the question she evenbravely followed it up i haven t really after all had tothink much to see that much more can be done for you than isdone mr verver uttered an odd vague sound don t you think a gooddeal is done when you come out and talk to me this way ah said his daughter smiling at him we make too much ofthat and then to explain that s good and it s natural butit isn t great we forget that we re as free as air well that s great mr verver pleaded great if we act on it not if we don t she continued to smile and he took her smile wondering again alittle by this time however struck more and more by anintensity in it that belied a light tone what do you want hedemanded to do to me and he added as she didn t say you vegot something in your mind it had come to him within the minutethat from the beginning of their session there she had beenkeeping something back and that an impression of this had morethan once in spite of his general theoretic respect for herpresent right to personal reserves and mysteries almost ceasedto be vague in him there had been from the first something inher anxious eyes in the way she occasionally lost herself thatit would perfectly explain he was therefore now quite sure you ve got something up your sleeve she had a silence that made him right well when i tell youyou ll understand it s only up my sleeve in the sense of beingin a letter i got this morning all day yes it has been in mymind i ve been asking myself if it were quite the right moment or in any way fair to ask you if you could stand just nowanother woman it relieved him a little yet the beautiful consideration of hermanner made it in a degree portentous stand one well mind her coming he stared then he laughed it depends on who she is there you see i ve at all events been thinking whether you dtake this particular person but as a worry the more whether that is you d go so far with her in your notion of having to bekind he gave at this the quickest shake to his foot how far would shego in her notion of it well his daughter returned you know how far in a generalway charlotte stant goes charlotte is she coming she writes me practically that she d like to if we re so goodas to ask her mr verver continued to gaze but rather as if waiting for more then as everything appeared to have come his expression had adrop if this was all it was simple then why in the world not maggie s face lighted anew but it was now another light itisn t a want of tact to ask her to propose it to you that i should ask her he put the question as an effect of his remnant of vagueness butthis had also its own effect maggie wondered an instant afterwhich as with a flush of recognition she took it up it wouldbe too beautiful if you would this clearly had not been her first idea the chance of hiswords had prompted it do you mean write to her myself yes it would be kind it would be quite beautiful of you thatis of course said maggie if you sincerely can he appeared to wonder an instant why he sincerely shouldn t andindeed for that matter where the question of sincerity came in this virtue between him and his daughter s friend had surelybeen taken for granted my dear child he returned i don tthink i m afraid of charlotte well that s just what it s lovely to have from you from themoment you re not the least little bit i ll immediately inviteher but where in the world is she he spoke as if he had notthought of charlotte nor so much as heard her name pronounced for a very long time he quite in fact amicably almost amusedly woke up to her she s in brittany at a little bathing place with some people idon t know she s always with people poor dear she rather hasto be even when as is sometimes the case they re people shedoesn t immensely like well i guess she likes us said adam verver yes fortunatelyshe likes us and if i wasn t afraid of spoiling it for you maggie added i d even mention that you re not the one of ournumber she likes least why should that spoil it for me oh my dear you know what else have we been talking about itcosts you so much to be liked that s why i hesitated to tell youof my letter he stared a moment as if the subject had suddenly grown out ofrecognition but charlotte on other visits never used to costme anything no only her keep maggie smiled then i don t think i mind her keep if that s all theprincess however it was clear wished to be thoroughlyconscientious well it may not be quite all if i think of itsbeing pleasant to have her it s because she will make adifference well what s the harm in that if it s but a difference for thebetter ah then there you are and the princess showed in her smileher small triumphant wisdom if you acknowledge a possibledifference for the better we re not after all so tremendouslyright as we are i mean we re not as satisfied and amused we dosee there are ways of being grander but will charlotte stant her father asked with surprise makeus grander maggie on this looking at him well had a remarkable reply yes i think really grander he thought for if this was a sudden opening he wished but themore to meet it because she s so handsome no father and the princess was almost solemn because she sso great great great in nature in character in spirit great in life so mr verver echoed what has she done in life well she has been brave and bright said maggie that mayn tsound like much but she has been so in the face of things thatmight well have made it too difficult for many other girls shehasn t a creature in the world really that is nearly belongingto her only acquaintances who in all sorts of ways make use ofher and distant relations who are so afraid she ll make use ofthem that they seldom let her look at them mr verver was struck and as usual to some purpose if we gether here to improve us don t we too then make use of her it pulled the princess up however but an instant we re old old friends we do her good too i should always even at theworst speaking for myself admire her still more than i usedher i see that always does good maggie hesitated certainly she knows it she knows i mean how great i think her courage and her cleverness she s notafraid not of anything and yet she no more ever takes a libertywith you than if she trembled for her life and then she sinteresting which plenty of other people with plenty of othermerits never are a bit in which fine flicker of visionthe truth widened to the princess s view i myself of coursedon t take liberties but then i do always by nature tremblefor my life that s the way i live oh i say love her father vaguely murmured yes i live in terror she insisted i m a small creepingthing you ll not persuade me that you re not as good as charlottestant he still placidly enough remarked i may be as good but i m not so great and that s what we retalking about she has a great imagination she has in everyway a great attitude she has above all a great conscience more perhaps than ever in her life before maggie addressed herfather at this moment with a shade of the absolute in her tone she had never come so near telling him what he should take itfrom her to believe she has only twopence in the world butthat has nothing to do with it or rather indeed she quicklycorrected herself it has everything for she doesn t care inever saw her do anything but laugh at her poverty her life hasbeen harder than anyone knows it was moreover as if thus unprecedentedly positive his childhad an effect upon him that mr verver really felt as a newthing why then haven t you told me about her before well haven t we always known i should have thought he submitted that we had alreadypretty well sized her up certainly we long ago quite took her for granted but thingschange with time and i seem to know that after this interval i m going to like her better than ever i ve lived more myself i m older and one judges better yes i m going to see incharlotte said the princess and speaking now as with high andfree expectation more than i ve ever seen then i ll try to do so too she was it came back to mr ververmore the one of your friends i thought the best for you his companion however was so launched in her permitted libertyof appreciation that she for the moment scarce heard him she waslost in the case she made out the vision of the different waysin which charlotte had distinguished herself she would have liked for instance i m sure she would have likedextremely to marry and nothing in general is more ridiculous even when it has been pathetic than a woman who has tried andhas not been able it had all mr verver s attention she has tried she has seen cases where she would have liked to but she has not been able well there are more cases in europe in which it doesn t cometo girls who are poor than in which it does come to them especially said maggie with her continued competence whenthey re americans well her father now met her and met her cheerfully on allsides unless you mean he suggested that when the girls areamerican there are more cases in which it comes to the rich thanto the poor she looked at him good humouredly that may be but i m notgoing to be smothered in my case it ought to make me if i werein danger of being a fool all the nicer to people likecharlotte it s not hard for me she practically explained notto be ridiculous unless in a very different way i might easilybe ridiculous i suppose by behaving as if i thought i had donea great thing charlotte at any rate has done nothing andanyone can see it and see also that it s rather strange and yetno one no one not awfully presumptuous or offensive would like or would dare to treat her just as she is as anything butquite right that s what it is to have something about you thatcarries things off mr verver s silence on this could only be a sign that she hadcaused her story to interest him though the sign when he spokewas perhaps even sharper and is it also what you mean bycharlotte s being great well said maggie it s one of her ways but she has many again for a little her father considered and who is it she hastried to marry maggie on her side as well waited as if to bring it out witheffect but she after a minute either renounced or encountered anobstacle i m afraid i m not sure then how do you know well i don t know and qualifying again she was earnestlyemphatic i only make it out for myself but you must make it out about someone in particular she had another pause i don t think i want even for myself toput names and times to pull away any veil i ve an idea therehas been more than once somebody i m not acquainted with andneedn t be or want to be in any case it s all over and beyondgiving her credit for everything it s none of my business mr verver deferred yet he discriminated i don t see how youcan give credit without knowing the facts can t i give it generally for dignity dignity i mean inmisfortune you ve got to postulate the misfortune first well said maggie i can do that isn t it always a misfortuneto be when you re so fine so wasted and yet she went on not to wail about it not to look even as if you knew it mr verver seemed at first to face this as a large question andthen after a little solicited by another view to let theappeal drop well she mustn t be wasted we won t at least havewaste it produced in maggie s face another gratitude then dear sir that s all i want and it would apparently have settled their question and endedtheir talk if her father had not after a little shown thedisposition to revert how many times are you supposing that shehas tried once more at this and as if she hadn t been couldn t be hatedto be in such delicate matters literal she was moved toattenuate oh i don t say she absolutely ever tried he looked perplexed but if she has so absolutely failed whatthen had she done she has suffered she has done that and the princess added she has loved and she has lost mr verver however still wondered but how many times maggie hesitated but it cleared up once is enough enough that is for one to be kind to her her father listened yet not challenging only as with a need ofsome basis on which under these new lights his bounty could befirm but has she told you nothing ah thank goodness no he stared then don t young women tell because you mean it s just what they re supposed to do shelooked at him flushed again now with which after anotherhesitation do young men tell she asked he gave a short laugh how do i know my dear what young mendo then how do i know father what vulgar girls do i see i see he quickly returned but she spoke the next moment as if she might odiously havebeen sharp what happens at least is that where there s a greatdeal of pride there s a great deal of silence i don t know iadmit what i should do if i were lonely and sore for whatsorrow to speak of have i ever had in my life i don t knoweven if i m proud it seems to me the question has never come upfor me oh i guess you re proud mag her father cheerfullyinterposed i mean i guess you re proud enough well then i hope i m humble enough too i might at all events for all i know be abject under a blow how can i tell do yourealise father that i ve never had the least blow he gave her a long quiet look who should realise if i don t well you ll realise when i have one she exclaimed with ashort laugh that resembled as for good reasons his own of aminute before i wouldn t in any case have let her tell me whatwould have been dreadful to me for such wounds and shames aredreadful at least she added catching herself up i supposethey are for what as i say do i know of them i don t want toknow she spoke quite with vehemence there are things thatare sacred whether they re joys or pains but one can always forsafety be kind she kept on one feels when that s right she had got up with these last words she stood there before himwith that particular suggestion in her aspect to which even thelong habit of their life together had not closed his sense keptsharp year after year by the collation of types and signs thecomparison of fine object with fine object of one degree offinish of one form of the exquisite with another the appearanceof some slight slim draped antique of vatican or capitolinehalls late and refined rare as a note and immortal as a link set in motion by the miraculous infusion of a modern impulse andyet for all the sudden freedom of folds and footsteps forsakenafter centuries by their pedestal keeping still the quality theperfect felicity of the statue the blurred absent eyes thesmoothed elegant nameless head the impersonal flit of acreature lost in an alien age and passing as an image in wornrelief round and round a precious vase she had always had oddmoments of striking him daughter of his very own though she was as a figure thus simplified generalised in its grace a figurewith which his human connection was fairly interrupted by somevague analogy of turn and attitude something shyly mythologicaland nymphlike the trick he was not uncomplacently aware wasmainly of his own mind it came from his caring for preciousvases only less than for precious daughters and what was more tothe point still it often operated while he was quite at the sametime conscious that maggie had been described even in herprettiness as prim mrs rance herself had enthusiasticallyused the word of her while he remembered that when once she hadbeen told before him familiarly that she resembled a nun shehad replied that she was delighted to hear it and would certainlytry to while also finally it was present to him that discreetly heedless thanks to her long association withnobleness in art to the leaps and bounds of fashion she broughther hair down very straight and flat over her temples in theconstant manner of her mother who had not been a bitmythological nymphs and nuns were certainly separate types butmr verver when he really amused himself let consistency go the play of vision was at all events so rooted in him that hecould receive impressions of sense even while positivelythinking he was positively thinking while maggie stood there and it led for him to yet another question which in its turn ledto others still do you regard the condition as hers then thatyou spoke of a minute ago the condition why that of having loved so intensely that she s as you say beyond everything maggie had scarcely to reflect her answer was so prompt oh no she s beyond nothing for she has had nothing i see you must have had things to be them it s a kind of lawof perspective maggie didn t know about the law but she continued definite she s not for example beyond help oh well then she shall have all we can give her i ll write toher he said with pleasure angel she answered as she gaily and tenderly looked at him true as this might be however there was one thing more he wasan angel with a human curiosity has she told you she likes memuch certainly she has told me but i won t pamper you let it beenough for you it has always been one of my reasons for likingher then she s indeed not beyond everything mr verver more orless humorously observed oh it isn t thank goodness that she s in love with you it snot as i told you at first the sort of thing for you to fear he had spoken with cheer but it appeared to drop before thisreassurance as if the latter overdid his alarm and that shouldbe corrected oh my dear i ve always thought of her as alittle girl ah she s not a little girl said the princess then i ll write to her as a brilliant woman it s exactly what she is mr verver had got up as he spoke and for a little beforeretracing their steps they stood looking at each other as ifthey had really arranged something they had come out togetherfor themselves but it had produced something more what it hadproduced was in fact expressed by the words with which he met hiscompanion s last emphasis well she has a famous friend in you princess maggie took this in it was too plain for a protest do you knowwhat i m really thinking of she asked he wondered with her eyes on him eyes of contentment at herfreedom now to talk and he wasn t such a fool he presentlyshowed as not suddenly to arrive at it why of your findingher at last yourself a husband good for you maggie smiled but it will take she added some looking then let me look right here with you her father said as theywalked on ximrs assingham and the colonel quitting fawns before the end ofseptember had come back later on and now a couple of weeksafter they were again interrupting their stay but this timewith the question of their return left to depend on matters thatwere rather hinted at than importunately named the lutches andmrs rance had also by the action of charlotte stant s arrival ceased to linger though with hopes and theories as to somepromptitude of renewal of which the lively expression awakeningthe echoes of the great stone paved oak panelled galleried hallthat was not the least interesting feature of the place seemedstill a property of the air it was on this admirable spot that before her october afternoon had waned fanny assingham spentwith her easy host a few moments which led to her announcing herown and her husband s final secession at the same time as theytempted her to point the moral of all vain reverberations thedouble door of the house stood open to an effect of hazy autumnsunshine a wonderful windless waiting golden hour under theinfluence of which adam verver met his genial friend as she cameto drop into the post box with her own hand a thick sheaf ofletters they presently thereafter left the house together anddrew out half an hour on the terrace in a manner they were torevert to in thought later on as that of persons who really hadbeen taking leave of each other at a parting of the ways hetraced his impression on coming to consider back to a merethree words she had begun by using about charlotte stant shesimply cleared them out those had been the three words thrownoff in reference to the general golden peace that the kentishoctober had gradually ushered in the halcyon days the fullbeauty of which had appeared to shine out for them aftercharlotte s arrival for it was during these days that mrs ranceand the miss lutches had been observed to be gathering themselvesfor departure and it was with that difference made that thesense of the whole situation showed most fair the sense of howright they had been to engage for so ample a residence and ofall the pleasure so fruity an autumn there could hold in its lap this was what had occurred that their lesson had been learned and what mrs assingham had dwelt upon was that without charlotteit would have been learned but half it would certainly not havebeen taught by mrs rance and the miss lutches if these ladieshad remained with them as long as at one time seemed probable charlotte s light intervention had thus become a cause operatingcovertly but none the less actively and fanny assingham sspeech which she had followed up a little echoed within him fairly to startle him as the indication of somethingirresistible he could see now how this superior force hadworked and he fairly liked to recover the sight little harm ashe dreamed of doing little ill as he dreamed of wishing thethree ladies whom he had after all entertained for a stiffishseries of days she had been so vague and quiet about it wonderful charlotte that he hadn t known what was happening happening that is as a result of her influence their fires as they felt her turned to smoke mrs assingham remarked which he was to reflect on indeed even while they strolled hehad retained since his long talk with maggie the talk that hadsettled the matter of his own direct invitation to her friend anodd little taste as he would have described it for hearingthings said about this young woman hearing so to speak whatcould be said about her almost as it her portrait by someeminent hand were going on so that he watched it grow under themultiplication of touches mrs assingham it struck him appliedtwo or three of the finest in their discussion of their youngfriend so different a figure now from that early playmate ofmaggie s as to whom he could almost recall from of old thedefinite occasions of his having paternally lumped the twochildren together in the recommendation that they shouldn t maketoo much noise nor eat too much jam his companion professed thatin the light of charlotte s prompt influence she had not been astranger to a pang of pity for their recent visitors i felt infact privately so sorry for them that i kept my impression tomyself while they were here wishing not to put the rest of youon the scent neither maggie nor the prince nor yourself noreven charlotte herself if you didn t happen to notice since youdidn t apparently i perhaps now strike you as extravagant buti m not i followed it all one saw the consciousness i speak ofcome over the poor things very much as i suppose people at thecourt of the borgias may have watched each other begin to lookqueer after having had the honour of taking wine with the headsof the family my comparison s only a little awkward for i don tin the least mean that charlotte was consciously dropping poisoninto their cup she was just herself their poison in the senseof mortally disagreeing with them but she didn t know it ah she didn t know it mr verver had asked with interest well i think she didn t mrs assingham had to admit that shehadn t pressingly sounded her i don t pretend to be sure inevery connection of what charlotte knows she doesn t certainly like to make people suffer not in general as is thecase with so many of us even other women she likes much ratherto put them at their ease with her she likes that is as allpleasant people do to be liked ah she likes to be liked her companion had gone on she did at the same time no doubt want to help us to put usat our ease that is she wanted to put you and to put maggieabout you so far as that went she had a plan but it was onlyafter it was not before i really believe that she saw howeffectively she could work again as mr verver felt he must have taken it up ah shewanted to help us wanted to help me why mrs assingham asked after an instant should it surpriseyou he just thought oh it doesn t she saw of course as soon as she came with her quickness where we all were she didn t need each of us to go byappointment to her room at night or take her out into thefields for our palpitating tale no doubt even she was ratherimpatient of the poor things mr verver had here inquired while hewaited well of your not yourselves being so and of your not inparticular i haven t the least doubt in the world par exemple that she thinks you too meek oh she thinks me too meek and she had been sent for on the very face of it to work rightin all she had to do after all was to be nice to you to a me said adam verver he could remember now that his friend had positively had a laughfor his tone to you and to every one she had only to be whatshe is and to be it all round if she s charming how can shehelp it so it was and so only that she acted as the borgiawine used to act one saw it come over them the extent to which in her particular way a woman a woman other and so other thanthemselves could be charming one saw them understand andexchange looks then one saw them lose heart and decide to move for what they had to take home was that it s she who s the realthing ah it s she who s the real thing as he had not hitherto takenit home as completely as the miss lutches and mrs rance so doubtless he had now a little appeared to offer submission inhis appeal i see i see he could at least simply take it homenow yet as not without wanting at the same time to be sure ofwhat the real thing was and what would it be a definitelythat you understand by that she had only for an instant not found it easy to say why exactly what those women themselves want to be and what hereffect on them is to make them recognise that they never will oh of course never it not only remained and abode with them it positively developedand deepened after this talk that the luxurious side of hispersonal existence was now again furnished socially speaking with the thing classed and stamped as real just as he had beenable to think of it as not otherwise enriched in consequence ofhis daughter s marriage the note of reality in so muchprojected light continued to have for him the charm and theimportance of which the maximum had occasionally been reached inhis great finds continued beyond any other to keep himattentive and gratified nothing perhaps might affect us asqueerer had we time to look into it than this application ofthe same measure of value to such different pieces of property asold persian carpets say and new human acquisitions all themore indeed that the amiable man was not without an inkling onhis own side that he was as a taster of life economicallyconstructed he put into his one little glass everything heraised to his lips and it was as if he had always carried in hispocket like a tool of his trade this receptacle a little glasscut with a fineness of which the art had long since been lost and kept in an old morocco case stamped in uneffaceable gilt withthe arms of a deposed dynasty as it had served him to satisfyhimself so to speak both about amerigo and about the bernadinoluini he had happened to come to knowledge of at the time he wasconsenting to the announcement of his daughter s betrothal so itserved him at present to satisfy himself about charlotte stantand an extraordinary set of oriental tiles of which he had latelygot wind to which a provoking legend was attached and as towhich he had made out contentedly that further news was to beobtained from a certain mr gutermann seuss of brighton it wasall at bottom in him the aesthetic principle planted where itcould burn with a cold still flame where it fed almost whollyon the material directly involved on the idea followed byappropriation of plastic beauty of the thing visibly perfect inits kind where in short in spite of the general tendency ofthe devouring element to spread the rest of his spiritualfurniture modest scattered and tended with unconscious care escaped the consumption that in so many cases proceeds from theundue keeping up of profane altar fires adam verver had in otherwords learnt the lesson of the senses to the end of his ownlittle book without having for a day raised the smallestscandal in his economy at large being in this particular notunlike those fortunate bachelors or other gentlemen of pleasure who so manage their entertainment of compromising company thateven the austerest housekeeper occupied and competent below stairs never feels obliged to give warning that figure has however a freedom that the occasion doubtlessscarce demands though we may retain it for its rough negativevalue it was to come to pass by a pressure applied to thesituation wholly from within that before the first ten days ofnovember had elapsed he found himself practically alone at fawnswith his young friend amerigo and maggie having with a certainabruptness invited his assent to their going abroad for a month since his amusement was now scarce less happily assured than hissecurity an impulse eminently natural had stirred within theprince his life as for some time established was deliciouslydull and thereby on the whole what he best liked but a smallgust of yearning had swept over him and maggie repeated to herfather with infinite admiration the pretty terms in which after it had lasted a little he had described to her thisexperience he called it a serenade a low music that outsideone of the windows of the sleeping house disturbed his rest atnight timid as it was and plaintive he yet couldn t close hiseyes for it and when finally rising on tiptoe he had lookedout he had recognised in the figure below with a mandolin allduskily draped in her grace the raised appealing eyes and theone irresistible voice of the ever to be loved italy sooner orlater that way one had to listen it was a hovering hauntingghost as of a creature to whom one had done a wrong a dim pathetic shade crying out to be comforted for this there wasobviously but one way as there were doubtless also many wordsfor the simple fact that so prime a roman had a fancy for againseeing rome they would accordingly hadn t they better go fora little maggie meanwhile making the too absurdly artful pointwith her father so that he repeated it in his amusement tocharlotte stant to whom he was by this time conscious ofaddressing many remarks that it was absolutely when she came tothink the first thing amerigo had ever asked of her shedoesn t count of course his having asked of her to marry him this was mr verver s indulgent criticism but he foundcharlotte equally touched by the ingenuous maggie in easyagreement with him over the question if the prince had askedsomething of his wife every day in the year this would be stillno reason why the poor dear man should not in a beautiful fit ofhomesickness revisit without reproach his native country what his father in law frankly counselled was that thereasonable the really too reasonable pair should while theywere about it take three or four weeks of paris as well parisbeing always for mr verver in any stress of sympathy asuggestion that rose of itself to the lips if they would only dothat on their way back or however they preferred it charlotteand he would go over to join them there for a small look thougheven then assuredly as he had it at heart to add not in theleast because they should have found themselves bored at beingleft together the fate of this last proposal indeed was that itreeled for the moment under an assault of destructive analysisfrom maggie who having as she granted to choose between beingan unnatural daughter or an unnatural mother and electing forthe former wanted to know what would become of the principino ifthe house were cleared of everyone but the servants her questionhad fairly resounded but it had afterwards like many of herquestions dropped still more effectively than it had risen thehighest moral of the matter being before the couple took theirdeparture that mrs noble and dr brady must mount unchallengedguard over the august little crib if she hadn t supremelybelieved in the majestic value of the nurse whose experience wasin itself the amplest of pillows just as her attention was aspreading canopy from which precedent and reminiscence dropped asthickly as parted curtains if she hadn t been able to rest inthis confidence she would fairly have sent her husband on hisjourney without her in the same manner if the sweetest for itwas so she qualified him of little country doctors hadn t provedto her his wisdom by rendering irresistible especially on rainydays and in direct proportion to the frequency of his calls adapted to all weathers that she should converse with him forhours over causes and consequences over what he had found toanswer with his little five at home she would have drawn scantsupport from the presence of a mere grandfather and a merebrilliant friend these persons accordingly her ownpredominance having thus for the time given way could carrywith a certain ease and above all with mutual aid theirconsciousness of a charge so far as their office weighed theycould help each other with it which was in fact to become asmrs noble herself loomed larger for them not a little of arelief and a diversion mr verver met his young friend at certain hours in theday nursery very much as he had regularly met the child s fondmother charlotte having as she clearly considered given maggieequal pledges and desiring never to fail of the last word for thedaily letter she had promised to write she wrote with highfidelity she let her companion know and the effect of it was remarkably enough that he himself didn t write the reason ofthis was partly that charlotte told all about him which shealso let him know she did and partly that he enjoyed feeling asa consequence that he was generally quite systematically easedand as they said done for committed as it were to thischarming and clever young woman who by becoming for him adomestic resource had become for him practically a new person and committed especially in his own house which somehow madehis sense of it a deeper thing he took an interest in seeing howfar the connection could carry him could perhaps even lead him and in thus putting to the test for pleasant verification whatfanny assingham had said at the last about the difference sucha girl could make she was really making one now in theirsimplified existence and a very considerable one though therewas no one to compare her with as there had been so usefully for fanny no mrs rance no kitty no dotty lutch to help herto be felt according to fanny s diagnosis as real she wasreal decidedly from other causes and mr verver grew in timeeven a little amused at the amount of machinery mrs assinghamhad seemed to see needed for pointing it she was directly andimmediately real real on a pleasantly reduced and intimatescale and at no moments more so than during those at which wehave just glanced when mrs noble made them both together feelthat she she alone in the absence of the queen mother wasregent of the realm and governess of the heir treated on suchoccasions as at best a pair of dangling and merely nominalcourt functionaries picturesque hereditary triflers entitled tothe petites entrees but quite external to the state which beganand ended with the nursery they could only retire in quickenedsociability to what was left them of the palace there to digesttheir gilded insignificance and cultivate in regard to the trueexecutive such snuff taking ironies as might belong to rococochamberlains moving among china lap dogs every evening after dinner charlotte stant played to him seated at the piano and requiring no music she went through his favourite things and he had many favourites with a facilitythat never failed or that failed but just enough to pick itselfup at a touch from his fitful voice she could play anything shecould play everything always shockingly she of course insisted but always by his own vague measure very much as if she might slim sinuous and strong and with practised passion have beenplaying lawn tennis or endlessly and rhythmically waltzing hislove of music unlike his other loves owned to vaguenesses butwhile on his comparatively shaded sofa and smoking smoking always smoking in the great fawns drawing room as everywhere the cigars of his youth rank with associations while i say heso listened to charlotte s piano where the score was ever absentbut between the lighted candles the picture distinct thevagueness spread itself about him like some boundless carpet asurface delightfully soft to the pressure of his interest it wasa manner of passing the time that rather replaced conversation but the air at the end none the less before they separated had a way of seeming full of the echoes of talk they separated in the hushed house not quite easily yet not quite awkwardlyeither with tapers that twinkled in the large dark spaces andfor the most part so late that the last solemn servant had beendismissed for the night late as it was on a particular evening toward the end of october there had been a full word or two dropped into the still stirringsea of other voices a word or two that affected our friend evenat the moment and rather oddly as louder and rounder than anyprevious sound and then he had lingered under pretext of anopened window to be made secure after taking leave of hiscompanion in the hall and watching her glimmer away up thestaircase he had for himself another impulse than to go to bed picking up a hat in the hall slipping his arms into a sleevelesscape and lighting still another cigar he turned out upon theterrace through one of the long drawing room windows and moved toand fro there for an hour beneath the sharp autumn stars it waswhere he had walked in the afternoon sun with fanny assingham and the sense of that other hour the sense of the suggestivewoman herself was before him again as in spite of all theprevious degustation we have hinted at it had not yet been hethought in a loose an almost agitated order of many things the power that was in them to agitate having been part of hisconviction that he should not soon sleep he truly felt for awhile that he should never sleep again till something had come tohim some light some idea some mere happy word perhaps that hehad begun to want but had been till now and especially the lastday or two vainly groping for can you really then come if westart early that was practically all he had said to the girlas she took up her bedroom light and why in the world not wheni ve nothing else to do and should besides so immensely likeit this had as definitely been on her side the limit of thelittle scene there had in fact been nothing to call a scene even of the littlest at all though he perhaps didn t quite knowwhy something like the menace of one hadn t proceeded from herstopping half way upstairs to turn and say as she looked down onhim that she promised to content herself for their journey with a toothbrush and a sponge there hovered about him at allevents while he walked appearances already familiar as well astwo or three that were new and not the least vivid of the formerconnected itself with that sense of being treated withconsideration which had become for him as we have noted one ofthe minor yet so far as there were any such quite one of thecompensatory incidents of being a father in law it had struckhim up to now that this particular balm was a mixture of whichamerigo as through some hereditary privilege alone possessedthe secret so that he found himself wondering if it had come to charlotte who had unmistakably acquired it through the youngman s having amiably passed it on she made use for her soquietly grateful host however this might be of quite the sameshades of attention and recognition was mistress in an equaldegree of the regulated the developed art of placing him high inthe scale of importance that was even for his own thought aclumsy way of expressing the element of similarity in theagreeable effect they each produced on him and it held him for alittle only because this coincidence in their felicity caused himvaguely to connect or associate them in the matter of tradition training tact or whatever else one might call it it mightalmost have been if such a link between them was to beimagined that amerigo had a little coached or incited theiryoung friend or perhaps rather that she had simply as one ofthe signs of the general perfection fanny assingham commended inher profited by observing during her short opportunity beforethe start of the travellers the pleasant application by theprince of his personal system he might wonder what exactly itwas that they so resembled each other in treating him like fromwhat noble and propagated convention in cases in which theexquisite importance was to be neither too grossly attributednor too grossly denied they had taken their specific lesson butthe difficulty was here of course that one could really neverknow couldn t know without having been one s self a personage whether a pope a king a president a peer a general or just abeautiful author before such a question as before several others when theyrecurred he would come to a pause leaning his arms on the oldparapet and losing himself in a far excursion he had as to somany of the matters in hand a divided view and this was exactlywhat made him reach out in his unrest for some idea lurking inthe vast freshness of the night at the breath of whichdisparities would submit to fusion and so spreading beneathhim make him feel that he floated what he kept finding himselfreturn to disturbingly enough was the reflection deeper thananything else that in forming a new and intimate tie he shouldin a manner abandon or at the best signally relegate hisdaughter he should reduce to definite form the idea that he hadlost her as was indeed inevitable by her own marriage heshould reduce to definite form the idea of his having incurred aninjury or at the best an inconvenience that required somemakeweight and deserved some amends and he should do this themore which was the great point that he should appear to adopt in doing it the sentiment in fact the very conviction entertained and quite sufficiently expressed by maggie herself in her beautiful generosity as to what he had suffered puttingit with extravagance at her hands if she put it withextravagance the extravagance was yet sincere for it came whichshe put with extravagance too from her persistence always inthinking feeling talking about him as young he had hadglimpses of moments when to hear her thus in her absolutelyunforced compunction one would have supposed the special edge ofthe wrong she had done him to consist in his having still beforehim years and years to groan under it she had sacrificed aparent the pearl of parents no older than herself it wouldn tso much have mattered if he had been of common parental age thathe wasn t that he was just her extraordinary equal andcontemporary this was what added to her act the long train ofits effect light broke for him at last indeed quite as aconsequence of the fear of breathing a chill upon this luxurianceof her spiritual garden as at a turn of his labyrinth he saw hisissue which opened out so wide for the minute that he held hisbreath with wonder he was afterwards to recall how just then the autumn night seemed to clear to a view in which the wholeplace everything round him the wide terrace where he stood theothers with their steps below the gardens the park the lake the circling woods lay there as under some strange midnight sun it all met him during these instants as a vast expanse ofdiscovery a world that looked so lighted extraordinarily new and in which familiar objects had taken on a distinctness that as if it had been a loud a spoken pretension to beauty interest importance to he scarce knew what gave them aninordinate quantity of character and verily an inordinate size this hallucination or whatever he might have called it wasbrief but it lasted long enough to leave him gasping the gaspof admiration had by this time however lost itself in anintensity that quickly followed the way the wonder of it sincewonder was in question truly had been the strange delay of hisvision he had these several days groped and groped for an objectthat lay at his feet and as to which his blindness came from hisstupidly looking beyond it had sat all the while at his hearth stone whence it now gazed up in his face once he had recognised it there everything became coherent thesharp point to which all his light converged was that the wholecall of his future to him as a father would be in his somanaging that maggie would less and less appear to herself tohave forsaken him and it not only wouldn t be decently humane decently possible not to make this relief easy to her the ideashone upon him more than that as exciting inspiring uplifting it fell in so beautifully with what might be otherwisepossible it stood there absolutely confronted with the materialway in which it might be met the way in which it might be metwas by his putting his child at peace and the way to put her atpeace was to provide for his future that is for hers bymarriage by a marriage as good speaking proportionately ashers had been as he fairly inhaled this measure of refreshmenthe tasted the meaning of recent agitations he had seen thatcharlotte could contribute what he hadn t seen was what shecould contribute to when it had all supremely cleared up and hehad simply settled this service to his daughter well before himas the proper direction of his young friend s leisure the cooldarkness had again closed round him but his moral lucidity wasconstituted it wasn t only moreover that the word with a click so fitted the riddle but that the riddle in such perfection fitted the word he might have been equally in want and yet nothave had his remedy oh if charlotte didn t accept him ofcourse the remedy would fail but as everything had fallentogether it was at least there to be tried and success would begreat that was his last throb if the measure of relief effectedfor maggie should at all prove to have been given by his ownactual sense of felicity he really didn t know when in his lifehe had thought of anything happier to think of it merely forhimself would have been even as he had just lately felt evendoing all justice to that condition yes impossible but therewas a grand difference in thinking of it for his child xiiit was at brighton above all that this difference came out itwas during the three wonderful days he spent there with charlottethat he had acquainted himself further though doubtless not evennow quite completely with the merits of his majestic scheme andwhile moreover to begin with he still but held his vision inplace steadying it fairly with his hands as he had oftensteadied for inspection a precarious old pot or kept a glazedpicture in its right relation to the light the other the outerpresumptions in his favour those independent of what he mighthimself contribute and that therefore till he should speak remained necessarily vague that quantity i say struck him aspositively multiplying as putting on in the fresh brighton airand on the sunny brighton front a kind of tempting palpability he liked in this preliminary stage to feel that he should beable to speak and that he would the word itself beingromantic pressing for him the spring of association with storiesand plays where handsome and ardent young men in uniforms tights cloaks high boots had it in soliloquies ever on theirlips and the sense on the first day that he should probably havetaken the great step before the second was over conduced alreadyto make him say to his companion that they must spend more thantheir mere night or two at his ease on the ground of what wasbefore him he at all events definitely desired to be and it wasstrongly his impression that he was proceeding step by step hewas acting it kept coming back to that not in the dark but inthe high golden morning not in precipitation flurry fever dangers these of the path of passion properly so called but withthe deliberation of a plan a plan that might be a thing of lessjoy than a passion but that probably would in compensation forthat loss be found to have the essential property to wear eventhe decent dignity of reaching further and of providing for morecontingencies the season was in local parlance on theelements were assembled the big windy hotel the draughty socialhall swarmed with types in charlotte s constant phrase andresounded with a din in which the wild music of gilded andbefrogged bands croatian dalmatian carpathian violentlyexotic and nostalgic was distinguished as struggling against theperpetual popping of corks much of this would decidedly havedisconcerted our friends if it hadn t all happened morepreponderantly to give them the brighter surprise the nobleprivacy of fawns had left them had left mr verver at least with a little accumulated sum of tolerance to spend on the highpitch and high colour of the public sphere fawns as it had beenfor him and as maggie and fanny assingham had both attested wasout of the world whereas the scene actually about him with thevery sea a mere big booming medium for excursions and aquariums affected him as so plump in the conscious centre that nothingcould have been more complete for representing that pulse of lifewhich they had come to unanimity at home on the subject of theiradvisedly not hereafter forgetting the pulse of life was whatcharlotte in her way at home had lately reproduced and therewere positively current hours when it might have been open to hercompanion to feel himself again indebted to her forintroductions he had brought her to put it crudely but itwas almost as if she were herself in her greater gaiety herlivelier curiosity and intensity her readier happier irony taking him about and showing him the place no one really whenhe came to think had ever taken him about before it had alwaysbeen he of old who took others and who in particular tookmaggie this quickly fell into its relation with him as part ofan experience marking for him no doubt what people call considerately a time of life a new and pleasant order aflattered passive state that might become why shouldn t it one of the comforts of the future mr gutermann seuss proved on the second day our friend hadwaited till then a remarkably genial a positively lustrousyoung man occupying a small neat house in a quarter of the placeremote from the front and living as immediate and striking signstestified in the bosom of his family our visitors foundthemselves introduced by the operation of close contiguity to anumerous group of ladies and gentlemen older and younger and ofchildren larger and smaller who mostly affected them as scarceless anointed for hospitality and who produced at first theimpression of a birthday party of some anniversary gregariouslyand religiously kept though they subsequently fell into theirplaces as members of one quiet domestic circle preponderantlyand directly indebted for their being in fact to mr gutermann seuss to the casual eye a mere smart and shining youthof less than thirty summers faultlessly appointed in everyparticular he yet stood among his progeny eleven in all as heconfessed without a sigh eleven little brown clear faces yetwith such impersonal old eyes astride of such impersonal oldnoses while he entertained the great american collector whom hehad so long hoped he might meet and whose charming companion the handsome frank familiar young lady presumably mrs verver noticed the graduated offspring noticed the fat ear ringedaunts and the glossy cockneyfied familiar uncles inimitable ofaccent and assumption and of an attitude of cruder intentionthan that of the head of the firm noticed the place in short noticed the treasure produced noticed everything as from thehabit of a person finding her account at any time according to awisdom well learned of life in almost any funny impression itreally came home to her friend on the spot that this free rangeof observation in her picking out the frequent funny withextraordinary promptness would verily henceforth make adifferent thing for him of such experiences of the customaryhunt for the possible prize the inquisitive play of his acceptedmonomania which different thing could probably be a lighter andperhaps thereby a somewhat more boisterously refreshing form ofsport such omens struck him as vivid in any case when mr gutermann seuss with a sharpness of discrimination he had atfirst scarce seemed to promise invited his eminent couple intoanother room before the threshold of which the rest of thetribe unanimously faltering dropped out of the scene thetreasure itself here the objects on behalf of which mr verver sinterest had been booked established quickly enough their claimto engage the latter s attention yet at what point of his pastdid our friend s memory looking back and back catch him in anysuch place thinking so much less of wares artfully paraded thanof some other and quite irrelevant presence such places were notstrange to him when they took the form of bourgeois back parlours a trifle ominously grey and grim from their northlight at watering places prevailingly homes of humbug or evenwhen they wore some aspect still less if not perhaps still more insidious he had been everywhere pried and prowled everywhere going on occasion so far as to risk he believed life healthand the very bloom of honour but where while precious things extracted one by one from thrice locked yet often vulgar drawersand soft satchels of old oriental ilk were impressively rangedbefore him had he till now let himself in consciousness wander like one of the vague he didn t betray it ah that he knew but two recognitions tookplace for him at once and one of them suffered a little insweetness by the confusion mr gutermann seuss had truly forthe crisis the putting down of his cards a rare manner he wasperfect master of what not to say to such a personage as mr verver while the particular importance that dispenses withchatter was diffused by his movements themselves his repeatedact of passage between a featureless mahogany meuble and a tableso virtuously disinterested as to look fairly smug under a cottoncloth of faded maroon and indigo all redolent of patriarchalteas the damascene tiles successively and oh so tenderly unmuffled and revealed lay there at last in their full harmonyand their venerable splendour but the tribute of appreciationand decision was while the spectator considered simplified to apoint that but just failed of representing levity on the part ofa man who had always acknowledged without shame in such affairs the intrinsic charm of what was called discussion the infinitelyancient the immemorial amethystine blue of the glaze scarcelymore meant to be breathed upon it would seem than the cheek ofroyalty this property of the ordered and matched array hadinevitably all its determination for him but his submission was perhaps for the first time in his life of the quick mind alone the process really itself in its way as fine as the perfectionperceived and admired every inch of the rest of him being givento the foreknowledge that an hour or two later he should have spoken the burning of his ships therefore waited too near tolet him handle his opportunity with his usual firm and sentientfingers waited somehow in the predominance of charlotte s veryperson in her being there exactly as she was capable as mr gutermann seuss himself was capable of the right felicity ofsilence but with an embracing ease through it all that madedeferred criticism as fragrant as some joy promised a lover byhis mistress or as a big bridal bouquet held patiently behindher he couldn t otherwise have explained surely why he foundhimself thinking to his enjoyment of so many other matters thanthe felicity of his acquisition and the figure of his cheque quite equally high any more than why later on with theirreturn to the room in which they had been received and therenewed encompassment of the tribe he felt quite merged in theelated circle formed by the girl s free response to thecollective caress of all the shining eyes and by her genialacceptance of the heavy cake and port wine that as she wasafterwards to note added to their transaction for a finish thetouch of some mystic rite of old jewry this characterisation came from her as they walked away walkedtogether in the waning afternoon back to the breezy sea and thebustling front back to the nimble and the flutter and theshining shops that sharpened the grin of solicitation on the maskof night they were walking thus as he felt nearer and nearerto where he should see his ships burn and it was meanwhile forhim quite as if this red glow would impart at the harmonioushour a lurid grandeur to his good faith it was meanwhile too asign of the kind of sensibility often playing up in him that fabulous as this truth may sound he found a sentimental link anobligation of delicacy or perhaps even one of the penalties ofits opposite in his having exposed her to the north light thequite properly hard business light of the room in which they hadbeen alone with the treasure and its master she had listened tothe name of the sum he was capable of looking in the face giventhe relation of intimacy with him she had already beyond allretractation accepted the stir of the air produced at the otherplace by that high figure struck him as a thing that from themoment she had exclaimed or protested as little as he himself hadapologised left him but one thing more to do a man of decentfeeling didn t thrust his money a huge lump of it in such away under a poor girl s nose a girl whose poverty was after afashion the very basis of her enjoyment of his hospitality without seeing logically a responsibility attached and thiswas to remain none the less true for the fact that twenty minuteslater after he had applied his torch applied it with a sign ortwo of insistence what might definitely result failed to beimmediately clear he had spoken spoken as they sat together onthe out of the way bench observed during one of their walks andkept for the previous quarter of the present hour well in hismemory s eye the particular spot to which between intensepauses and intenser advances he had all the while consistentlyled her below the great consolidated cliff well on to where thecity of stucco sat most architecturally perched with therumbling beach and the rising tide and the freshening stars infront and above the safe sense of the whole place yet prevailedin lamps and seats and flagged walks hovering also overhead inthe close neighbourhood of a great replete community about toassist anew at the removal of dish covers we ve had as it seems to me such quite beautiful daystogether that i hope it won t come to you too much as a shockwhen i ask if you think you could regard me with any satisfactionas a husband as if he had known she wouldn t she of coursecouldn t at all gracefully and whether or no reply with arush he had said a little more quite as he had felt he must inthinking it out in advance he had put the question on whichthere was no going back and which represented thereby thesacrifice of his vessels and what he further said was to standfor the redoubled thrust of flame that would make combustionsure this isn t sudden to me and i ve wondered at moments ifyou haven t felt me coming to it i ve been coming ever since weleft fawns i really started while we were there he spokeslowly giving her as he desired time to think all the morethat it was making her look at him steadily and making her also in a remarkable degree look well while she did so a largeand so far a happy consequence she wasn t at all eventsshocked which he had glanced at but for a handsome humility andhe would give her as many minutes as she liked you mustn tthink i m forgetting that i m not young oh that isn t so it s i that am old you are young this waswhat she had at first answered and quite in the tone too ofhaving taken her minutes it had not been wholly to the point but it had been kind which was what he most wanted and shekept for her next words to kindness kept to her clear loweredvoice and unshrinking face to me too it thoroughly seems thatthese days have been beautiful i shouldn t be grateful to themif i couldn t more or less have imagined their bringing us tothis she affected him somehow as if she had advanced a step tomeet him and yet were at the same time standing still it onlymeant however doubtless that she was gravely and reasonably thinking as he exactly desired to make her if she would butthink enough she would probably think to suit him it seems tome she went on that it s for you to be sure ah but i am sure said adam verver on matters of importancei never speak when i m not so if you can yourself face such aunion you needn t in the least trouble she had another pause and she might have been felt as facing itwhile through lamplight and dusk through the breath of themild slightly damp southwest she met his eyes without evasion yet she had at the end of another minute debated only to theextent of saying i won t pretend i don t think it would be goodfor me to marry good for me i mean she pursued because i mso awfully unattached i should like to be a little less adrift i should like to have a home i should like to have an existence i should like to have a motive for one thing more than another amotive outside of myself in fact she said so sincerely thatit almost showed pain yet so lucidly that it almost showedhumour in fact you know i want to be married it s well it s the condition the condition he was just vague it s the state i mean i don t like my own miss among usall is too dreadful except for a shopgirl i don t want to be ahorrible english old maid oh you want to be taken care of very well then i ll do it i dare say it s very much that only i don t see why for what ispeak of she smiled for a mere escape from my state i needdo quite so much so much as marry me in particular her smile was as for true directness i might get what i wantfor less you think it so much for you to do yes she presently said i think it s a great deal then it was that though she was so gentle so quite perfect withhim and he felt he had come on far then it was that of a suddensomething seemed to fail and he didn t quite know where theywere there rose for him with this the fact to be sure oftheir disparity deny it as mercifully and perversely as shewould he might have been her father of course yes that s mydisadvantage i m not the natural i m so far from being theideal match to your youth and your beauty i ve the drawback thatyou ve seen me always so inevitably in such another light but she gave a slow headshake that made contradiction soft madeit almost sad in fact as from having to be so complete and hehad already before she spoke the dim vision of some objectionin her mind beside which the one he had named was light andwhich therefore must be strangely deep you don t understand me it s of all that it is for you to do it s of that i m thinking oh with this for him the thing was clearer then you needn tthink i know enough what it is for me to do but she shook her head again i doubt if you know i doubt ifyou can and why not please when i ve had you so before me that i mold has at least that fact about it to the good that i ve knownyou long and from far back do you think you ve known me asked charlotte stant hehesitated for the tone of it and her look with it might havemade him doubt just these things in themselves however withall the rest with his fixed purpose now his committed deed thefine pink glow projected forward of his ships behind him definitely blazing and crackling this quantity was to push himharder than any word of her own could warn him all that she washerself moreover was so lighted to its advantage by the pinkglow he wasn t rabid but he wasn t either as a man of a properspirit to be frightened what is that then if i accept it butas strong a reason as i can want for just learning to know you she faced him always kept it up as for honesty and yet at thesame time in her odd way as for mercy how can you tellwhether if you did you would it was ambiguous for an instant as she showed she felt i meanwhen it s a question of learning one learns sometimes too late i think it s a question he promptly enough made answer ofliking you the more just for your saying these things you shouldmake something he added of my liking you i make everything but are you sure of having exhausted allother ways this of a truth enlarged his gaze but what other ways why you ve more ways of being kind than anyone i ever knew take it then he answered that i m simply putting them alltogether for you she looked at him on this long again stillas if it shouldn t be said she hadn t given him time or hadwithdrawn from his view so to speak a single inch of hersurface this at least she was fully to have exposed itrepresented her as oddly conscientious and he scarce knew inwhat sense it affected him on the whole however withadmiration you re very very honourable it s just what i want to be i don t see she added whyyou re not right i don t see why you re not happy as you are ican not ask myself i can not ask you she went on if you rereally as much at liberty as your universal generosity leads youto assume oughtn t we she asked to think a little of others oughtn t i at least in loyalty at any rate in delicacy tothink of maggie with which intensely gentle so as not toappear too much to teach him his duty she explained she severything to you she has always been are you so certain thatthere s room in your life for another daughter is that what you mean she had not hungupon it long but he had quickly taken her up he had not however disconcerted her for another young woman very much of her age and whose relation to her has always beenso different from what our marrying would make it for anothercompanion said charlotte stant can t a man be all his life then he almost fiercely asked anything but a father but he went on before she could answer you talk about differences but they ve been already made as noone knows better than maggie she feels the one she made herselfby her own marriage made i mean for me she constantly thinksof it it allows her no rest to put her at peace is therefore he explained what i m trying with you to do i can t do italone but i can do it with your help you can make her hesaid positively happy about me about you she thoughtfully echoed but what can i make herabout herself oh if she s at ease about me the rest will take care of itself the case he declared is in your hands you ll effectually putout of her mind that i feel she has abandoned me interest certainly now was what he had kindled in her face butit was all the more honourable to her as he had just called itthat she should want to see each of the steps of his conviction if you ve been driven to the likes of me mayn t it show thatyou ve felt truly forsaken well i m willing to suggest that if i can show at the sametime that i feel consoled but have you she demanded really felt so he hesitated consoled forsaken no i haven t but if it s her idea if it was her idea inshort that was enough this enunciation of motive the nextmoment however sounded to him perhaps slightly thin so that hegave it another touch that is if it s my idea i happen yousee to like my idea well it s beautiful and wonderful but isn t it possibly charlotte asked not quite enough to marry me for why so my dear child isn t a man s idea usually what he doesmarry for charlotte considering looked as if this might perhaps be alarge question or at all events something of an extension of onethey were immediately concerned with doesn t that a good dealdepend on the sort of thing it may be she suggested that aboutmarriage ideas as he called them might differ with which however giving no more time to it she sounded another question don t you appear rather to put it to me that i may accept youroffer for maggie s sake somehow she turned it over i don tso clearly see her quite so much finding reassurance or evenquite so much needing it do you then make nothing at all of her having been so ready toleave us ah charlotte on the contrary made much she was ready to leaveus because she had to be from the moment the prince wanted itshe could only go with him perfectly so that if you see your way she will be able to gowith him in future as much as she likes charlotte appeared to examine for a minute in maggie s interest this privilege the result of which was a limited concession you ve certainly worked it out of course i ve worked it out that s exactly what i have done she hadn t for a long time been so happy about anything as atyour being there with me i was to be with you said charlotte for her security well adam verver rang out this is her security you veonly if you can t see it to ask her ask her the girl echoed it in wonder certainly in somany words telling her you don t believe me still she debated do you mean write it to her quite so immediately to morrow oh i don t think i can write it said charlotte stant when iwrite to her and she looked amused for so different a shade it s about the principino s appetite and dr brady s visits very good then put it to her face to face we ll go straight toparis to meet them charlotte at this rose with a movement that was like a smallcry but her unspoken sense lost itself while she stood with hereyes on him he keeping his seat as for the help it gave him alittle to make his appeal go up presently however a new sensehad come to her and she covered him kindly with the expressionof it i do think you know you must rather like me thank you said adam verver you will put it to her yourselfthen she had another hesitation we go over you say to meet them as soon as we can get back to fawns and wait there for them ifnecessary till they come wait a at fawns wait in paris that will be charming in itself you take me to pleasant places she turned it over youpropose to me beautiful things it rests but with you to make them beautiful and pleasant you ve made brighton ah she almost tenderly protested with what i m doing now you re promising me now what i want aren t you promising me he pressed getting up aren t you promising me to abide by whatmaggie says oh she wanted to be sure she was do you mean she ll ask it ofme it gave him indeed as by communication a sense of the proprietyof being himself certain yet what was he but certain she llspeak to you she ll speak to you for me this at last then seemed to satisfy her very good may we waitagain to talk of it till she has done so he showed with hishands down in his pockets and his shoulders expressively up acertain disappointment soon enough none the less hisgentleness was all back and his patience once more exemplary ofcourse i give you time especially he smiled as it s timethat i shall be spending with you our keeping on together willhelp you perhaps to see to see i mean how i need you i already see said charlotte how you ve persuaded yourselfyou do but she had to repeat it that isn t unfortunately all well then how you ll make maggie right right she echoed it as if the word went far and o oh she still critically murmured as they moved together away xiiihe had talked to her of their waiting in paris a week later buton the spot there this period of patience suffered no greatstrain he had written to his daughter not indeed from brighton but directly after their return to fawns where they spent onlyforty eight hours before resuming their journey and maggie sreply to his news was a telegram from rome delivered to him atnoon of their fourth day and which he brought out to charlotte who was seated at that moment in the court of the hotel wherethey had agreed that he should join her for their proceedingtogether to the noontide meal his letter at fawns a letter ofseveral pages and intended lucidly unreservedly in fact all buttriumphantly to inform had proved on his sitting down to it and a little to his surprise not quite so simple a document toframe as even his due consciousness of its weight of meaning hadallowed him to assume this doubtless however only for reasonsnaturally latent in the very wealth of that consciousness whichcontributed to his message something of their own quality ofimpatience the main result of their talk for the time had beena difference in his relation to his young friend as well as adifference equally sensible in her relation to himself andthis in spite of his not having again renewed his undertaking to speak to her so far even as to tell her of the communicationdespatched to rome delicacy a delicacy more beautiful still all the delicacy she should want reigned between them it beingrudimentary in their actual order that she mustn t be furtherworried until maggie should have put her at her ease it was just the delicacy however that in paris which suggestively was brighton at a hundredfold higher pitch made between him and his companion the tension made the suspense made what he would have consented perhaps to call the provisionalpeculiarity of present conditions these elements acted in amanner of their own imposing and involving under one head manyabstentions and precautions twenty anxieties and reminders things verily he would scarce have known how to express andyet creating for them at every step an acceptance of theirreality he was hanging back with charlotte till another personshould intervene for their assistance and yet they had by whathad already occurred been carried on to something it was out ofthe power of other persons to make either less or greater commonconventions that was what was odd had to be on this basis morethought of those common conventions that previous to thepassage by the brighton strand he had so enjoyed the sense oftheir overlooking the explanation would have been he supposed or would have figured it with less of unrest that paris had inits way deeper voices and warnings so that if you went at all far there it laid bristling traps as they might have beenviewed all smothered in flowers for your going further still there were strange appearances in the air and before you knew ityou might be unmistakably matching them since he wishedtherefore to match no appearance but that of a gentleman playingwith perfect fairness any game in life he might be called to hefound himself on the receipt of maggie s missive rejoicing witha certain inconsistency the announcement made her from home had in the act cost some biting of his pen to sundry parts of him his personal modesty his imagination of her prepared state forso quick a jump it didn t much matter which and yet he was moreeager than not for the drop of delay and for the quickertransitions promised by the arrival of the imminent pair therewas after all a hint of offence to a man of his age in beingtaken as they said at the shops on approval maggie certainly would have been as far as charlotte herself from positivelydesiring this and charlotte on her side as far as maggie fromholding him light as a real value she made him fidget thus poorgirl but from generous rigour of conscience these allowances of his spirit were all the same consistentwith a great gladness at the sight of the term of his ordeal forit was the end of his seeming to agree that questions and doubtshad a place the more he had inwardly turned the matter over themore it had struck him that they had in truth only an ugliness what he could have best borne as he now believed would havebeen charlotte s simply saying to him that she didn t like himenough this he wouldn t have enjoyed but he would quite haveunderstood it and been able ruefully to submit she did like himenough nothing to contradict that had come out for him so thathe was restless for her as well as for himself she looked at himhard a moment when he handed her his telegram and the look forwhat he fancied a dim shy fear in it gave him perhaps his bestmoment of conviction that as a man so to speak he properlypleased her he said nothing the words sufficiently did it forhim doing it again better still as charlotte who had left herchair at his approach murmured them out we start to night tobring you all our love and joy and sympathy there they were the words and what did she want more she didn t however asshe gave him back the little unfolded leaf say they were enough though he saw the next moment that her silence was probablynot disconnected from her having just visibly turned pale herextraordinarily fine eyes as it was his present theory that hehad always thought them shone at him the more darkly out of thischange of colour and she had again with it her apparent way ofsubjecting herself for explicit honesty and through herwillingness to face him to any view he might take all at hisease and even to wantonness of the condition he produced inher as soon as he perceived that emotion kept her soundless heknew himself deeply touched since it proved that little as sheprofessed she had been beautifully hoping they stood there aminute while he took in from this sign that yes then certainlyshe liked him enough liked him enough to make him old as he wasready to brand himself flush for the pleasure of it thepleasure of it accordingly made him speak first do you begin alittle to be satisfied still however she had to think we ve hurried them you see why so breathless a start because they want to congratulate us they want said adamverver to see our happiness she wondered again and this time also for him as publicly aspossible so much as that do you think it s too much she continued to think plainly they weren t to have started foranother week well what then isn t our situation worth the little sacrifice we ll go back to rome as soon as you like with them this seemed to hold her as he had previously seen her held justa trifle inscrutably by his allusions to what they would dotogether on a certain contingency worth it the littlesacrifice for whom for us naturally yes she said we wantto see them for our reasons that is she rather dimly smiled you do and you do my dear too he bravely declared yes then i dotoo she after an instant ungrudging enough acknowledged forus however something depends on it rather but does nothing depend on it for them what can from the moment that as appears they don t want tonip us in the bud i can imagine their rushing up to prevent us but an enthusiasm for us that can wait so very little suchintense eagerness i confess she went on more than a littlepuzzles me you may think me she also added ungracious andsuspicious but the prince can t at all want to come back sosoon he wanted quite too intensely to get away mr verver considered well hasn t he been away yes just long enough to see how he likes it besides saidcharlotte he may not be able to join in the rosy view of ourcase that you impute to her it can t in the least have appearedto him hitherto a matter of course that you should give his wifea bouncing stepmother adam verver at this looked grave i m afraid then he ll justhave to accept from us whatever his wife accepts and accept it if he can imagine no better reason just because she does that he declared will have to do for him his tone made her for a moment meet his face after which letme she abruptly said see it again taking from him thefolded leaf that she had given back and he had kept in his hand isn t the whole thing she asked when she had read it over perhaps but a way like another for their gaining time he again stood staring but the next minute with that upwardspring of his shoulders and that downward pressure of his pocketswhich she had already more than once at disconcerted moments determined in him he turned sharply away and wandered from herin silence he looked about in his small despair he crossed thehotel court which overarched and glazed muffled against loudsounds and guarded against crude sights heated gilded draped almost carpeted with exotic trees in tubs exotic ladies inchairs the general exotic accent and presence suspended as withwings folded or feebly fluttering in the superior the supreme the inexorably enveloping parisian medium resembled somecritical apartment of large capacity some dental medical surgical waiting room a scene of mixed anxiety and desire preparatory for gathered barbarians to the due amputation orextraction of excrescences and redundancies of barbarism he wentas far as the porte cochere took counsel afresh of his usualoptimism sharpened even somehow just here by the very air hetasted and then came back smiling to charlotte it isincredible to you that when a man is still as much in love asamerigo his most natural impulse should be to feel what his wifefeels to believe what she believes to want what she wants inthe absence that is of special impediments to his so doing the manner of it operated she acknowledged with no great delaythis natural possibility no nothing is incredible to me ofpeople immensely in love well isn t amerigo immensely in love she hesitated but as for the right expression of her sense of thedegree but she after all adopted mr verver s immensely then there you are she had another smile however she wasn t there quite yet thatisn t all that s wanted but what more why that his wife shall have made him really believe that shereally believes with which charlotte became still more lucidlylogical the reality of his belief will depend in such a case onthe reality of hers the prince may for instance now she wenton have made out to his satisfaction that maggie may mainlydesire to abound in your sense whatever it is you do he mayremember that he has never seen her do anything else well said adam verver what kind of a warning will he havefound in that to what catastrophe will he have observed such adisposition in her to lead just to this one with which she struck him as risingstraighter and clearer before him than she had done even yet our little question itself her appearance had in fact at themoment such an effect on him that he could answer but inmarvelling mildness hadn t we better wait a while till we callit a catastrophe her rejoinder to this was to wait though by no means as long ashe meant when at the end of her minute she spoke however itwas mildly too what would you like dear friend to wait for it lingered between them in the air this demand and theyexchanged for the time a look which might have made each of themseem to have been watching in the other the signs of its overtirony these were indeed immediately so visible in mr verver sface that as if a little ashamed of having so markedly producedthem and as if also to bring out at last under pressure something she had all the while been keeping back she took ajump to pure plain reason you haven t noticed for yourself buti can t quite help noticing that in spite of what you assume weassume if you like maggie wires her joy only to you she makesno sign of its overflow to me it was a point and staring a moment he took account of it buthe had as before his presence of mind to say nothing of hiskindly humour why you complain of the very thing that s mostcharmingly conclusive she treats us already as one clearly now for the girl in spite of lucidity and logic therewas something in the way he said things she faced him in allher desire to please him and then her word quite simply anddefinitely showed it i do like you you know well what could this do but stimulate his humour i see what sthe matter with you you won t be quiet till you ve heard fromthe prince himself i think the happy man added that i ll goand secretly wire to him that you d like reply paid a few wordsfor yourself it could apparently but encourage her further to smile replypaid for him you mean or for me oh i ll pay with pleasure anything back for you as manywords as you like and he went on to keep it up not requiringeither to see your message she could take it visibly as he meant it should you requireto see the prince s not a bit you can keep that also to yourself on his speaking however as if his transmitting the hint were areal question she appeared to consider and almost as if forgood taste that the joke had gone far enough it doesn tmatter unless he speaks of his own movement and why should itbe she asked a thing that would occur to him i really think mr verver concurred that it naturallywouldn t he doesn t know you re morbid she just wondered but she agreed no he hasn t yet found itout perhaps he will but he hasn t yet and i m willing to givehim meanwhile the benefit of the doubt so with this thesituation to her view would appear to have cleared had she nottoo quickly had one of her restless relapses maggie however does know i m morbid she hasn t the benefit well said adam verver a little wearily at last i think ifeel that you ll hear from her yet it had even fairly come overhim under recurrent suggestion that his daughter s omission wassurprising and maggie had never in her life been wrong for morethan three minutes oh it isn t that i hold that i ve a right to it charlotte thenext instant rather oddly qualified and the observation itselfgave him a further push very well i shall like it myself at this then as if moved by his way of constantly and more orless against his own contention coming round to her she showedhow she could also always and not less gently come half way ispeak of it only as the missing grace the grace that s ineverything that maggie does it isn t my due she kept it up but taking from you that we may still expect it it will havethe touch it will be beautiful then come out to breakfast mr verver had looked at hiswatch it will be here when we get back if it isn t and charlotte smiled as she looked about for afeather boa that she had laid down on descending from her room if it isn t it will have had but that slight fault he saw her boa on the arm of the chair from which she had movedto meet him and after he had fetched it raising it to make itscharming softness brush his face for it was a wondrous productof paris purchased under his direct auspices the day before heheld it there a minute before giving it up will you promise methen to be at peace she looked while she debated at his admirable present ipromise you quite for ever quite for ever remember he went on to justify his demand remember that inwiring you she ll naturally speak even more for her husband thanshe has done in wiring me it was only at a word that charlotte had a demur naturally why our marriage puts him for you you see or puts you forhim into a new relation whereas it leaves his relation to meunchanged it therefore gives him more to say to you about it about its making me his stepmother in law or whatever i shouldbecome over which for a little she not undivertedly mused yes there may easily be enough for a gentleman to say to ayoung woman about that well amerigo can always be according to the case either asfunny or as serious as you like and whichever he may be for you in sending you a message he ll be it all and then as the girl with one of her so deeply and oddly yet so tenderly criticallooks at him failed to take up the remark he found himselfmoved as by a vague anxiety to add a question don t you thinkhe s charming oh charming said charlotte stant if he weren t i shouldn tmind no more should i her friend harmoniously returned ah but you don t mind you don t have to you don t have to imean as i have it s the last folly ever to care in an anxiousway the least particle more than one is absolutely forced if iwere you she went on if i had in my life for happiness andpower and peace even a small fraction of what you have it wouldtake a great deal to make me waste my worry i don t know shesaid what in the world that didn t touch my luck i shouldtrouble my head about i quite understand you yet doesn t it just depend mr ververasked on what you call one s luck it s exactly my luck thati m talking about i shall be as sublime as you like when you vemade me all right it s only when one is right that one reallyhas the things you speak of it isn t they he explained thatmake one so it s the something else i want that makes themright if you ll give me what i ask you ll see she had taken her boa and thrown it over her shoulders and hereyes while she still delayed had turned from him engaged byanother interest though the court was by this time the hour ofdispersal for luncheon so forsaken that they would have had it for free talk should they have been moved to loudness quite tothemselves she was ready for their adjournment but she was alsoaware of a pedestrian youth in uniform a visible emissary ofthe postes et telegraphes who had approached from the street the small stronghold of the concierge and who presented there amissive taken from the little cartridge box slung over hisshoulder the portress meeting him on the threshold metequally across the court charlotte s marked attention to hisvisit so that within the minute she had advanced to ourfriends with her cap streamers flying and her smile ofannouncement as ample as her broad white apron she raised alofta telegraphic message and as she delivered it sociablydiscriminated cette fois ci pour madame with which she asgenially retreated leaving charlotte in possession charlotte taking it held it at first unopened her eyes had come back toher companion who had immediately and triumphantly greeted it ah there you are she broke the envelope then in silence and for a minute as withthe message he himself had put before her studied its contentswithout a sign he watched her without a question and at lastshe looked up i ll give you she simply said what you ask the expression of her face was strange but since when had awoman s at moments of supreme surrender not a right to be hetook it in with his own long look and his grateful silence sothat nothing more for some instants passed between them theirunderstanding sealed itself he already felt that she had madehim right but he was in presence too of the fact that maggie hadmade her so and always therefore without maggie where infine would he be she united them brought them together as withthe click of a silver spring and on the spot with the visionof it his eyes filled charlotte facing him meanwhile with herexpression made still stranger by the blur of his gratitude through it all however he smiled what my child does forme through it all as well that is still through the blur he sawcharlotte rather than heard her reply she held her paper wideopen but her eyes were all for his it isn t maggie it s theprince i say he gaily rang out then it s best of all it s enough thank you for thinking so to which he added it s enough forour question but it isn t is it quite enough for ourbreakfast dejeunons she stood there however in spite of this appeal her documentalways before them don t you want to read it he thought not if it satisfies you i don t require it but she gave him as for her conscience another chance you canif you like he hesitated afresh but as for amiability not for curiosity is it funny thus finally she again dropped her eyes on it drawing in herlips a little no i call it grave ah then i don t want it very grave said charlotte stant well what did i tell you of him he asked rejoicing as theystarted a question for all answer to which before she took hisarm the girl thrust her paper crumpled into the pocket of hercoat part thirdxivcharlotte half way up the monumental staircase had begun bywaiting alone waiting to be rejoined by her companion who hadgone down all the way as in common kindness bound and who hisduty performed would know where to find her she was meanwhile though extremely apparent not perhaps absolutely advertised butshe would not have cared if she had been so little was it bythis time her first occasion of facing society with aconsciousness materially with a confidence quite splendidly enriched for a couple of years now she had known as never beforewhat it was to look well to look that is as well as she hadalways felt from far back that in certain conditions shemight on such an evening as this that of a great official partyin the full flush of the london spring time the conditionsaffected her her nerves her senses her imagination as allprofusely present so that perhaps at no moment yet had she beenso justified of her faith as at the particular instant of ourbeing again concerned with her that of her chancing to glancehigher up from where she stood and meeting in consequence thequiet eyes of colonel assingham who had his elbows on the broadbalustrade of the great gallery overhanging the staircase and whoimmediately exchanged with her one of his most artlessly familiarsignals this simplicity of his visual attention struck her evenwith the other things she had to think about as the quietestnote in the whole high pitch much in fact as if she hadpressed a finger on a chord or a key and created for the numberof seconds an arrest of vibration a more muffled thump thesight of him suggested indeed that fanny would be there thoughso far as opportunity went she had not seen her this was aboutthe limit of what it could suggest the air however had suggestions enough it abounded in them many of them precisely helping to constitute those conditionswith which for our young woman the hour was brilliantlycrowned she was herself in truth crowned and it all hungtogether melted together in light and colour and sound theunsurpassed diamonds that her head so happily carried the otherjewels the other perfections of aspect and arrangement that madeher personal scheme a success the proved private theory thatmaterials to work with had been all she required and that therewere none too precious for her to understand and use to whichmight be added lastly as the strong scented flower of the totalsweetness an easy command a high enjoyment of her crisis fora crisis she was ready to take it and this ease it was doubtless that helped her while she waited to the rightassurance to the right indifference to the right expression and above all as she felt to the right view of her opportunityfor happiness unless indeed the opportunity itself rather were in its mere strange amplitude the producing theprecipitating cause the ordered revellers rustling and shining with sweep of train and glitter of star and clink of sword andyet for all this but so imperfectly articulate so vaguelyvocal the double stream of the coming and the going flowingtogether where she stood passed her brushed her treated her tomuch crude contemplation and now and then to a spasm of speech an offered hand even in some cases to an unencouraged pause butshe missed no countenance and invited no protection she fairlyliked to be so long as she might just as she was exposed alittle to the public no doubt in her unaccompanied state but even if it were a bit brazen careless of queer reflections onthe dull polish of london faces and exposed since it was aquestion of exposure to much more competent recognitions of herown she hoped no one would stop she was positively keepingherself it was her idea to mark in a particular manner theimportance of something that had just happened she knew how sheshould mark it and what she was doing there made already abeginning when presently therefore from her standpoint she saw theprince come back she had an impression of all the place as higherand wider and more appointed for great moments with its dome oflustres lifted its ascents and descents more majestic itsmarble tiers more vividly overhung its numerosity of royalties foreign and domestic more unprecedented its symbolism of state hospitality both emphasised and refined this wasdoubtless a large consequence of a fairly familiar cause aconsiderable inward stir to spring from the mere vision strikingas that might be of amerigo in a crowd but she had her reasons she held them there she carried them in fact responsibly andovertly as she carried her head her high tiara her folded fan her indifferent unattended eminence and it was when he reachedher and she could taking his arm show herself as placed in herrelation that she felt supremely justified it was her notion ofcourse that she gave a glimpse of but few of her grounds for thisdiscrimination indeed of the most evident alone yet she wouldhave been half willing it should be guessed how she drewinspiration drew support in quantity sufficient for almostanything from the individual value that through all thepicture her husband s son in law kept for the eye deriving itfrom his fine unconscious way in the swarming social sum ofoutshining overlooking and overtopping it was as if inseparation even the shortest she half forgot or disbelieved howhe affected her sight so that reappearance had in him eachtime a virtue of its own a kind of disproportionate intensitysuggesting his connection with occult sources of renewal whatdid he do when he was away from her that made him always comeback only looking as she would have called it more so superior to any shade of cabotinage he yet almostresembled an actor who between his moments on the stage revisits his dressing room and before the glass pressed by hisneed of effect retouches his make up the prince was at present for instance though he had quitted her but ten minutes before still more than then the person it pleased her to be left with atruth that had all its force for her while he made her his carefor their conspicuous return together to the upper rooms conspicuous beyond any wish they could entertain was what poorwonderful man he couldn t help making it and when she raisedher eyes again on the ascent to bob assingham still aloft inhis gallery and still looking down at her she was aware that inspite of hovering and warning inward voices she even enjoyed thetestimony rendered by his lonely vigil to the lustre shereflected he was always lonely at great parties the dear colonel itwasn t in such places that the seed he sowed at home was everreaped by him but nobody could have seemed to mind it less tobrave it with more bronzed indifference so markedly that hemoved about less like one of the guests than like some quitepresentable person in charge of the police arrangements or theelectric light to mrs verver as will be seen he represented with the perfect good faith of his apparent blankness somethingdefinite enough though her bravery was not thereby too blightedfor her to feel herself calling him to witness that the onlywitchcraft her companion had used within the few minutes wasthat of attending maggie who had withdrawn from the scene toher carriage notified at all events of fanny s probablepresence charlotte was for a while after this divided betweenthe sense of it as a fact somehow to reckon with and deal with which was a perception that made in its degree for theprudence the pusillanimity of postponement of avoidance and aquite other feeling an impatience that presently ended byprevailing an eagerness really to be suspected sounded veritably arraigned if only that she might have the bad momentover if only that she might prove to herself let alone tomrs assingham also that she could convert it to good if only in short to be square as they said with her question forherself indeed particularly it wasn t a question but somethingin her bones told her that fanny would treat it as one and therewas truly nothing that from this friend she was not bound indecency to take she might hand things back with every tenderprecaution with acknowledgments and assurances but she owed itto them in any case and it to all mrs assingham had done forher not to get rid of them without having well unwrapped andturned them over to night as happened and she recognised it more and more withthe ebbing minutes as an influence of everything about her to night exactly she would no doubt since she knew why be asfirm as she might at any near moment again hope to be for goingthrough that process with the right temper and tone she said after a little to the prince stay with me let no one takeyou for i want her yes i do want her to see us together andthe sooner the better said it to keep her hand on him throughconstant diversions and made him in fact by saying it professa momentary vagueness she had to explain to him that it wasfanny assingham she wanted to see who clearly would be there since the colonel never either stirred without her or oncearrived concerned himself for her fate and she had further after amerigo had met her with see us together why in theworld hasn t she often seen us together to inform him thatwhat had elsewhere and otherwise happened didn t now matter andthat she at any rate well knew for the occasion what she wasabout you re strange cara mia he consentingly enoughdropped but for whatever strangeness he kept her as theycirculated from being waylaid even remarking to her afresh ashe had often done before on the help rendered in suchsituations by the intrinsic oddity of the london squash athing of vague slow senseless eddies revolving as in fear ofsome menace of conversation suspended over it the drop of which with some consequent refreshing splash or spatter yet never tookplace of course she was strange this as they went charlotteknew for herself how could she be anything else when thesituation holding her and holding him for that matter just asmuch had so the stamp of it she had already accepted herconsciousness as we have already noted that a crisis for themall was in the air and when such hours were not depressing which was the form indeed in which she had mainly known them they were apparently in a high degree exhilarating later on in a corner to which at sight of an empty sofa mrs assingham had after a single attentive arrest led her with acertain earnestness this vision of the critical was much moresharpened than blurred fanny had taken it from her yes she wasthere with amerigo alone maggie having come with them and then within ten minutes changed her mind repented and departed soyou re staying on together without her the elder woman hadasked and it was charlotte s answer to this that had determinedfor them quite indeed according to the latter s expectation theneed of some seclusion and her companion s pounce at the sofa they were staying on together alone and oh distinctly it wasalone that maggie had driven away her father as usual nothaving managed to come as usual mrs assingham had seemedto wonder mr verver s reluctances not having she in fact quiteintimated hitherto struck her charlotte responded at any rate that his indisposition to go out had lately much increased eventhough to night as she admitted he had pleaded his not feelingwell maggie had wished to stay with him for the prince and she dining out had afterwards called in portland place whence inthe event they had brought her charlotte on maggie had comebut to oblige her father she had urged the two others to gowithout her then she had yielded for the time to mr verver spersuasion but here when they had after the long wait in thecarriage fairly got in here once up the stairs with the roomsbefore them remorse had ended by seizing her she had listenedto no other remonstrance and at present therefore as charlotteput it the two were doubtless making together a little party athome but it was all right so charlotte also put it there wasnothing in the world they liked better than these snatchedfelicities little parties long talks with i ll come to youto morrow and no i ll come to you make believe renewals oftheir old life they were fairly at times the dear things likechildren playing at paying visits playing at mr thompson and mrs fane each hoping that the other would really stay to tea charlotte was sure she should find maggie there on getting home a remark in which mrs verver s immediate response to herfriend s inquiry had culminated she had thus on the spot thesense of having given her plenty to think about and thatmoreover of liking to see it even better than she had expected she had plenty to think about herself and there was alreadysomething in fanny that made it seem still more you say your husband s ill he felt too ill to come no my dear i think not if he had been too ill i wouldn t haveleft him and yet maggie was worried mrs assingham asked she worries you know easily she s afraid of influenza ofwhich he has had at different times though never with the leastgravity several attacks but you re not afraid of it charlotte had for a moment a pause it had continued to come toher that really to have her case out as they said with theperson in the world to whom her most intimate difficulties hadoftenest referred themselves would help her on the whole morethan hinder and under that feeling all her opportunity withnothing kept back with a thing or two perhaps even thrustforward seemed temptingly to open besides didn t fanny atbottom half expect absolutely at the bottom half want things so that she would be disappointed if after what must just haveoccurred for her she didn t get something to put between theteeth of her so restless rumination that cultivation of thefear of which our young woman had already had glimpses that shemight have gone too far in her irrepressible interest in otherlives what had just happened it pieced itself together forcharlotte was that the assingham pair drifting like everyoneelse had had somewhere in the gallery in the rooms anaccidental concussion had it after the colonel over hisbalustrade had observed in the favouring high light her publicjunction with the prince his very dryness in this encounter had as always struck a spark from his wife s curiosity and familiar on his side with all that she saw in things he hadthrown her as a fine little bone to pick some report of the wayone of her young friends was going on with another he knewperfectly such at least was charlotte s liberal assumption thatshe wasn t going on with anyone but she also knew that giventhe circumstances she was inevitably to be sacrificed in someform or another to the humorous intercourse of the inimitablecouple the prince meanwhile had also under coercion sacrificedher the ambassador had come up to him with a message fromroyalty to whom he was led away after which she had talked forfive minutes with sir john brinder who had been of theambassador s company and who had rather artlessly remained withher fanny had then arrived in sight of them at the same momentas someone else she didn t know someone who knew mrs assinghamand also knew sir john charlotte had left it to her friend scompetence to throw the two others immediately together and tofind a way for entertaining her in closer quarters this was thelittle history of the vision in her that was now rapidlyhelping her to recognise a precious chance the chance thatmightn t again soon be so good for the vivid making of a point her point was before her it was sharp bright true above allit was her own she had reached it quite by herself no one noteven amerigo amerigo least of all who would have nothing to dowith it had given her aid to make it now with force for fannyassingham s benefit would see her further in the direction inwhich the light had dawned than any other spring she should yetawhile doubtless be able to press the direction was that ofher greater freedom which was all in the world she had in mind her opportunity had accordingly after a few minutes of mrs assingham s almost imprudently interested expression of face positively acquired such a price for her that she may forourselves while the intensity lasted rather resemble a personholding out a small mirror at arm s length and consulting itwith a special turn of the head it was in a word with thisvalue of her chance that she was intelligently playing when shesaid in answer to fanny s last question don t you remember whatyou told me on the occasion of something or other the otherday that you believe there s nothing i m afraid of so my dear don t ask me mayn t i ask you mrs assingham returned how the case standswith your poor husband certainly dear only when you ask me as if i mightn t perhapsknow what to think it seems to me best to let you see that iknow perfectly what to think mrs assingham hesitated then blinking a little she took herrisk you didn t think that if it was a question of anyone sreturning to him in his trouble it would be better you yourselfshould have gone well charlotte s answer to this inquiry visibly shaped itself inthe interest of the highest considerations the highestconsiderations were good humour candour clearness and obviously the real truth if we couldn t be perfectly frank anddear with each other it would be ever so much better wouldn tit that we shouldn t talk about anything at all which however would be dreadful and we certainly at any rate haven t yetcome to it you can ask me anything under the sun you like because don t you see you can t upset me i m sure my dear charlotte fanny assingham laughed i don twant to upset you indeed love you simply couldn t even if you thought itnecessary that s all i mean nobody could for it belongs to mysituation that i m by no merit of my own just fixed fixed asfast as a pin stuck up to its head in a cushion i m placed ican t imagine anyone more placed there i am fanny had indeed never listened to emphasis more firmly applied and it brought into her own eyes though she had reasons forstriving to keep them from betrayals a sort of anxiety ofintelligence i dare say but your statement of your position however you see it isn t an answer to my inquiry it seems tome at the same time i confess mrs assingham added to givebut the more reason for it you speak of our being frank howcan we possibly be anything else if maggie has gone off throughfinding herself too distressed to stay and if she s willing toleave you and her husband to show here without her aren t thegrounds of her preoccupation more or less discussable if they re not charlotte replied it s only from their being in a way too evident they re not grounds for me they weren twhen i accepted adam s preference that i should come to nightwithout him just as i accept absolutely as a fixed rule allhis preferences but that doesn t alter the fact of course thatmy husband s daughter rather than his wife should have felt shecould after all be the one to stay with him the one to makethe sacrifice of this hour seeing especially that the daughterhas a husband of her own in the field with which she produced as it were her explanation i ve simply to see the truth of thematter see that maggie thinks more on the whole of fathersthan of husbands and my situation is such she went on thatthis becomes immediately don t you understand a thing i have tocount with mrs assingham vaguely heaving panting a little but trying notto show it turned about from some inward spring in her seat if you mean such a thing as that she doesn t adore theprince i don t say she doesn t adore him what i say is that shedoesn t think of him one of those conditions doesn t always atall stages involve the other this is just how she adores him charlotte said and what reason is there in the world afterall why he and i shouldn t as you say show together we veshown together my dear she smiled before her friend for a little only looked at her speaking then withabruptness you ought to be absolutely happy you live with suchgood people the effect of it as well was an arrest for charlotte whoseface however all of whose fine and slightly hard radiance ithad caused the next instant further to brighten does one everput into words anything so fatuously rash it s a thing that mustbe said in prudence for one by somebody who s so good as totake the responsibility the more that it gives one always achance to show one s best manners by not contradicting it certainly you ll never have the distress or whatever ofhearing me complain truly my dear i hope in all conscience not and the elderwoman s spirit found relief in a laugh more resonant than wasquite advised by their pursuit of privacy to this demonstration her friend gave no heed with all ourabsence after marriage and with the separation from her producedin particular by our so many months in america maggie has stillarrears still losses to make up still the need of showing how for so long she simply kept missing him she missed hiscompany a large allowance of which is in spite of everythingelse of the first necessity to her so she puts it in when shecan a little here a little there and it ends by making up aconsiderable amount the fact of our distinct establishments which has all the same everything in its favour charlottehastened to declare makes her really see more of him than whenthey had the same house to make sure she doesn t fail of itshe s always arranging for it which she didn t have to do whilethey lived together but she likes to arrange charlottesteadily proceeded it peculiarly suits her and the result ofour separate households is really for them more contact andmore intimacy to night for instance has been practically anarrangement she likes him best alone and it s the way saidour young woman in which he best likes her it s what i meantherefore by being placed and the great thing is as they say to know one s place doesn t it all strike you she wound up as rather placing the prince too fanny assingham had at this moment the sense as of a large heapeddish presented to her intelligence and inviting it to a feast sothick were the notes of intention in this remarkable speech butshe also felt that to plunge at random to help herself toofreely would apart from there not being at such a moment timefor it tend to jostle the ministering hand confound the arrayand more vulgarly speaking make a mess so she picked out after consideration a solitary plum so placed that you have toarrange certainly i have to arrange and the prince also if the effect for him is the same really i think not less and does he arrange mrs assingham asked to make up hisarrears the question had risen to her lips it was as ifanother morsel on the dish had tempted her the sound of itstruck her own ear immediately as giving out more of herthought than she had as yet intended but she quickly saw thatshe must follow it up at any risk with simplicity and thatwhat was simplest was the ease of boldness make them up imean by coming to see you charlotte replied however without as her friend would havephrased it turning a hair she shook her head but it wasbeautifully gentle he never comes oh said fanny assingham with which she felt a little stupid there it is he might so well you know otherwise otherwise and fanny was still vague it passed this time over her companion whose eyes wandering to a distance found themselves held the prince was at handagain the ambassador was still at his side they were stopped amoment by a uniformed personage a little old man of apparentlythe highest military character bristling with medals and orders this gave charlotte time to go on he has not been for threemonths and then as with her friend s last word in her ear otherwise yes he arranges otherwise and in my position she added i might too it s too absurd we shouldn t meet you ve met i gather said fanny assingham to night yes as far as that goes but what i mean is that i might placed for it as we both are go to see him and do you fanny asked with almost mistaken solemnity the perception of this excess made charlotte whether for gravityor for irony hang fire a minute i have been but that snothing she said in itself and i tell you of it only to showyou how our situation works it essentially becomes one asituation for both of us the prince s however is his ownaffair i meant but to speak of mine your situation s perfect mrs assingham presently declared i don t say it isn t taken in fact all round i think it is and i don t as i tell you complain of it the only thing isthat i have to act as it demands of me to act said mrs assingham with an irrepressible quaver isn t it acting my dear to accept it i do accept it what doyou want me to do less i want you to believe that you re a very fortunate person do you call that less charlotte asked with a smile from thepoint of view of my freedom i call it more let it take myposition any name you like don t let it at any rate and mrs assingham s impatienceprevailed at last over her presence of mind don t let it makeyou think too much of your freedom i don t know what you call too much for how can i not see it asit is you d see your own quickly enough if the colonel gave youthe same liberty and i haven t to tell you with your so muchgreater knowledge of everything what it is that gives suchliberty most for yourself personally of course charlotte wenton you only know the state of neither needing it nor missingit your husband doesn t treat you as of less importance to himthan some other woman ah don t talk to me of other women fanny now overtly panted do you call mr verver s perfectly natural interest in hisdaughter the greatest affection of which he is capable charlotte tookit up in all readiness i do distinctly and in spite of myhaving done all i could think of to make him capable of agreater i ve done earnestly everything i could i ve made it month after month my study but i haven t succeeded it has beenvividly brought home to me to night however she pursued i vehoped against hope for i recognise that as i told you at thetime i was duly warned and then as she met in her friend sface the absence of any such remembrance he did tell me that hewanted me just because i could be useful about her with whichcharlotte broke into a wonderful smile so you see i am it was on fanny assingham s lips for the moment to reply thatthis was on the contrary exactly what she didn t see she camein fact within an ace of saying you strike me as having quitefailed to help his idea to work since by your account maggiehas him not less but so much more on her mind how in theworld with so much of a remedy comes there to remain so much ofwhat was to be obviated but she saved herself in time conscious above all that she was in presence of still deeperthings than she had yet dared to fear that there was more init than any admission she had made represented and she had heldherself familiar with admissions so that not to seem tounderstand where she couldn t accept and not to seem to acceptwhere she couldn t approve and could still less withprecipitation advise she invoked the mere appearance of castingno weight whatever into the scales of her young friend sconsistency the only thing was that as she was quickly enoughto feel she invoked it rather to excess it brought her her invocation too abruptly to her feet she brushed awayeverything i can t conceive my dear what you re talkingabout charlotte promptly rose then as might be to meet it and hercolour for the first time perceptibly heightened she looked for the minute as her companion had looked as if twentyprotests blocking each other s way had surged up within her but when charlotte had to make a selection her selection wasalways the most effective possible it was happy now above all for being made not in anger but in sorrow you give me up then give you up you forsake me at the hour of my life when it seems to me i mostdeserve a friend s loyalty if you do you re not just fanny you re even i think she went on rather cruel and it s leastof all worthy of you to seem to wish to quarrel with me in orderto cover your desertion she spoke at the same time with thenoblest moderation of tone and the image of high pale lighteddisappointment she meanwhile presented as of a creature patientand lonely in her splendour was an impression so firmly imposedthat she could fill her measure to the brim and yet enjoy thelast word as it is called in such cases with a perfection voidof any vulgarity of triumph she merely completed for truth ssake her demonstration what is a quarrel with me but a quarrelwith my right to recognise the conditions of my bargain buti can carry them out alone she said as she turned away sheturned to meet the ambassador and the prince who their colloquywith their field marshal ended were now at hand and had already between them she was aware addressed her a remark that failedto penetrate the golden glow in which her intelligence wastemporarily bathed she had made her point the point she hadforeseen she must make she had made it thoroughly and once forall so that no more making was required and her success wasreflected in the faces of the two men of distinction before her unmistakably moved to admiration by her exceptional radiance sheat first but watched this reflection taking no note of any lessadequate form of it possibly presented by poor fanny poor fannyleft to stare at her incurred score chalked up in so fewstrokes on the wall then she took in what the ambassador wassaying in french what he was apparently repeating to her a desire for your presence madame has been expressed entres haut lieu and i ve let myself in for the responsibility tosay nothing of the honour of seeing as the most respectful ofyour friends that so august an impatience is not kept waiting the greatest possible personage had in short according to theodd formula of societies subject to the greatest personagespossible sent for her and she asked in her surprise whatin the world does he want to do to me only to know withoutlooking that fanny s bewilderment was called to a still largerapplication and to hear the prince say with authority indeedwith a certain prompt dryness you must go immediately it s asummons the ambassador using authority as well had alreadysomehow possessed himself of her hand which he drew into hisarm and she was further conscious as she went off with him that though still speaking for her benefit amerigo had turned tofanny assingham he would explain afterwards besides which shewould understand for herself to fanny however he had laughed as a mark apparently that for this infallible friend noexplanation at all would be necessary xvit may be recorded none the less that the prince was the nextmoment to see how little any such assumption was founded alonewith him now mrs assingham was incorruptible they send forcharlotte through you no my dear as you see through the ambassador ah but the ambassador and you for the last quarter of an hour have been for them as one he s your ambassador it may indeedbe further mentioned that the more fanny looked at it the moreshe saw in it they ve connected her with you she s treated asyour appendage oh my appendage the prince amusedly exclaimed cara mia what a name she s treated rather say as my ornament and myglory and it s so remarkable a case for a mother in law that yousurely can t find fault with it you ve ornaments enough it seems to me as you ve certainlyglories enough without her and she s not the least little bit mrs assingham observed your mother in law in such a matter ashade of difference is enormous she s no relation to youwhatever and if she s known in high quarters but as going aboutwith you then then she failed however as from positiveintensity of vision then then what he asked with perfectgood nature she had better in such a case not be known at all but i assure you i never just now so much as mentioned her doyou suppose i asked them said the young man still amused ifthey didn t want to see her you surely don t need to be shownthat charlotte speaks for herself that she does so above all onsuch an occasion as this and looking as she does to night how so looking can she pass unnoticed how can she not have success besides he added as she but watched his face letting him say what he would as if she wanted to see how hewould say it besides there is always the fact that we re ofthe same connection of what is your word the same concern we re certainly not with the relation of our respective sposi simply formal acquaintances we re in the same boat and theprince smiled with a candour that added an accent to hisemphasis fanny assingham was full of the special sense of his manner itcaused her to turn for a moment s refuge to a corner of hergeneral consciousness in which she could say to herself that shewas glad she wasn t in love with such a man as with charlottejust before she was embarrassed by the difference between whatshe took in and what she could say what she felt and what shecould show it only appears to me of great importance that nowthat you all seem more settled here charlotte should be known for any presentation any further circulation or introduction as in particular her husband s wife known in the leastpossible degree as anything else i don t know what you mean bythe same boat charlotte is naturally in mr verver s boat and pray am i not in mr verver s boat too why but for mr verver s boat i should have been by this time and his quickitalian gesture an expressive direction and motion of hisforefinger pointed to deepest depths away down down down she knew of course what he meant how it had taken hisfather in law s great fortune and taken no small slice tosurround him with an element in which all too fatally weightedas he had originally been he could pecuniarily float and withthis reminder other things came to her how strange it was that with all allowance for their merit it should befall some peopleto be so inordinately valued quoted as they said in thestock market so high and how still stranger perhaps thatthere should be cases in which for some reason one didn t mindthe so frequently marked absence in them of the purpose really torepresent their price she was thinking feeling at any rate for herself she was thinking that the pleasure she could take inthis specimen of the class didn t suffer from his consent to bemerely made buoyant partly because it was one of those pleasures he inspired them that by their nature couldn t suffer towhatever proof they were put and partly because besides heafter all visibly had on his conscience some sort of return forservices rendered he was a huge expense assuredly but it hadbeen up to now her conviction that his idea was to behavebeautifully enough to make the beauty well nigh an equivalent and that he had carried out his idea carried it out bycontinuing to lead the life to breathe the air very nearly tothink the thoughts that best suited his wife and her father this she had till lately enjoyed the comfort of so distinctlyperceiving as to have even been moved more than once to expressto him the happiness it gave her he had that in his favour asagainst other matters yet it discouraged her too and ratheroddly that he should so keep moving and be able to show herthat he moved on the firm ground of the truth hisacknowledgment of obligation was far from unimportant but shecould find in his grasp of the real itself a kind of ominousintimation the intimation appeared to peep at her even out ofhis next word lightly as he produced it isn t it rather as if we had charlotte and i for bringing ustogether a benefactor in common and the effect for hisinterlocutress was still further to be deepened i somehowfeel half the time as if he were her father in law too it s asif he had saved us both which is a fact in our lives or at anyrate in our hearts to make of itself a link don t youremember he kept it up how the day she suddenly turned upfor you just before my wedding we so frankly and funnilytalked in her presence of the advisability for her of somegood marriage and then as his friend s face in her extremity quite again as with charlotte but continued to fly the blackflag of general repudiation well we really began then as itseems to me the work of placing her where she is we were whollyright and so was she that it was exactly the thing is shown byits success we recommended a good marriage at almost any price so to speak and taking us at our word she has made the verybest that was really what we meant wasn t it only what shehas got something thoroughly good it would be difficult itseems to me for her to have anything better once you allow herthe way it s to be taken of course if you don t allow her thatthe case is different her offset is a certain decent freedom which i judge she ll be quite contented with you may say thatwill be very good of her but she strikes me as perfectly humbleabout it she proposes neither to claim it nor to use it with anysort of retentissement she would enjoy it i think quite asquietly as it might be given the boat you see the princeexplained it no less considerately and lucidly is a good dealtied up at the dock or anchored if you like out in the stream i have to jump out from time to time to stretch my legs andyou ll probably perceive if you give it your attention thatcharlotte really can t help occasionally doing the same it isn teven a question sometimes of one s getting to the dock one hasto take a header and splash about in the water call our havingremained here together to night call the accident of my havingput them put our illustrious friends there on my companion strack for i grant you this as a practical result of ourcombination call the whole thing one of the harmless littleplunges off the deck inevitable for each of us why not takethem when they occur as inevitable and above all as notendangering life or limb we shan t drown we shan t sink atleast i can answer for myself mrs verver too moreover do herthe justice visibly knows how to swim he could easily go on for she didn t interrupt him fanny feltnow that she wouldn t have interrupted him for the world shefound his eloquence precious there was not a drop of it that shedidn t in a manner catch as it came for immediate bottling for future preservation the crystal flask of her innermostattention really received it on the spot and she had evenalready the vision of how in the snug laboratory of herafterthought she should be able chemically to analyse it therewere moments positively still beyond this when with themeeting of their eyes something as yet unnamable came out forher in his look when something strange and subtle and atvariance with his words something that gave them away glimmereddeep down as an appeal almost an incredible one to her finercomprehension what inconceivably was it like wasn t it however gross such a rendering of anything so occult fairlylike a quintessential wink a hint of the possibility of theirreally treating their subject of course on some betteroccasion and thereby as well finding it much more interesting if this far red spark which might have been figured by her mindas the head light of an approaching train seen through the lengthof a tunnel was not on her side an ignis fatuus a meresubjective phenomenon it twinkled there at the direct expense ofwhat the prince was inviting her to understand meanwhile too however and unmistakably the real treatment of their subjectdid at a given moment sound this was when he proceeded withjust the same perfect possession of his thought on the manner ofwhich he couldn t have improved to complete his successfulsimile by another in fact by just the supreme touch the touchfor which it had till now been waiting for mrs verver to beknown to people so intensely and exclusively as her husband swife something is wanted that you know they haven t exactlygot he should manage to be known or at least to be seen alittle more as his wife s husband you surely must by this timehave seen for yourself that he has his own habits and his ownways and that he makes more and more as of course he has aperfect right to do his own discriminations he s so perfect soideal a father and doubtless largely by that very fact agenerous a comfortable an admirable father in law that ishould really feel it base to avail myself of any standpointwhatever to criticise him to you nevertheless i may make justone remark for you re not stupid you always understand soblessedly what one means he paused an instant as if even this one remark might bedifficult for him should she give no sign of encouraging him toproduce it nothing would have induced her however to encouragehim she was now conscious of having never in her life stood sostill or sat inwardly as it were so tight she felt like thehorse of the adage brought and brought by her own fault to thewater but strong for the occasion in the one fact that shecouldn t be forced to drink invited in other words tounderstand she held her breath for fear of showing she did andthis for the excellent reason that she was at last fairly afraidto it was sharp for her at the same time that she was certain in advance of his remark that she heard it before it hadsounded that she already tasted in fine the bitterness itwould have for her special sensibility but her companion froman inward and different need of his own was presently notdeterred by her silence what i really don t see is why fromhis own point of view given that is his conditions sofortunate as they stood he should have wished to marry at all there it was then exactly what she knew would come and exactly for reasons that seemed now to thump at her heart as distressingto her yet she was resolved meanwhile not to suffer as theyused to say of the martyrs then and there not to suffer odiously helplessly in public which could be prevented but byher breaking off with whatever inconsequence by her treatingtheir discussion as ended and getting away she suddenly wantedto go home much as she had wanted an hour or two before tocome she wanted to leave well behind her both her question andthe couple in whom it had abruptly taken such vivid form butit was dreadful to have the appearance of disconcerted flight discussion had of itself to her sense become danger suchlight as from open crevices it let in and the overtrecognition of danger was worse than anything else the worst infact came while she was thinking how she could retreat and stillnot overtly recognise her face had betrayed her trouble andwith that she was lost i m afraid however the prince said that i for some reason distress you for which i beg yourpardon we ve always talked so well together it has been fromthe beginning the greatest pull for me nothing so much as sucha tone could have quickened her collapse she felt he had her nowat his mercy and he showed as he went on that he knew it weshall talk again all the same better than ever i depend on ittoo much don t you remember what i told you so definitely oneday before my marriage that moving as i did in so many waysamong new things mysteries conditions expectations assumptions different from any i had known i looked to you asmy original sponsor my fairy godmother to see me through i begyou to believe he added that i look to you yet his very insistence had fortunately the next moment affectedher as bringing her help with which at least she could hold upher head to speak ah you are through you were through longago or if you aren t you ought to be well then if i ought to be it s all the more reason why youshould continue to help me because very distinctly i assureyou i m not the new things or ever so many of them are stillfor me new things the mysteries and expectations and assumptionsstill contain an immense element that i ve failed to puzzle out as we ve happened so luckily to find ourselves again reallytaking hold together you must let me as soon as possible cometo see you you must give me a good kind hour if you refuse itme and he addressed himself to her continued reserve i shallfeel that you deny with a stony stare your responsibility at this as from a sudden shake her reserve proved an inadequatevessel she could bear her own her private reference to theweight on her mind but the touch of another hand made it toohorribly press oh i deny responsibility to you so far as iever had it i ve done with it he had been all the while beautifully smiling but she made hislook now penetrate her again more as to whom then do youconfess it ah mio caro that s if to anyone my own business he continued to look at her hard you give me up then it was what charlotte had asked her ten minutes before and itscoming from him so much in the same way shook her in her place she was on the point of replying do you and she agree togetherfor what you ll say to me but she was glad afterwards to havechecked herself in time little as her actual answer had perhapsbettered it i think i don t know what to make of you you must receive me at least he said oh please not till i m ready for you and though she founda laugh for it she had to turn away she had never turned awayfrom him before and it was quite positively for her as if shewere altogether afraid of him xvilater on when their hired brougham had with the longvociferation that tormented her impatience been extricated fromthe endless rank she rolled into the london night beside herhusband as into a sheltering darkness where she could muffleherself and draw breath she had stood for the previous half hourin a merciless glare beaten upon stared out of countenance itfairly seemed to her by intimations of her mistake for what shewas most immediately feeling was that she had in the past beenactive for these people to ends that were now bearing fruit andthat might yet bear a larger crop she but brooded at first inher corner of the carriage it was like burying her exposed face a face too helplessly exposed in the cool lap of the commonindifference of the dispeopled streets of the closed shops anddarkened houses seen through the window of the brougham a worldmercifully unconscious and unreproachful it wouldn t like theworld she had just left know sooner or later what she had done or would know it at least only if the final consequence shouldbe some quite overwhelming publicity she fixed this possibilityitself so hard however for a few moments that the misery ofher fear produced the next minute a reaction and when thecarriage happened while it grazed a turn to catch the straightshaft from the lamp of a policeman in the act of playing hisinquisitive flash over an opposite house front she let herselfwince at being thus incriminated only that she might protest notless quickly against mere blind terror it had become for theoccasion preposterously terror of which she must shake herselffree before she could properly measure her ground the perceptionof this necessity had in truth soon aided her since she found on trying that lurid as her prospect might hover there shecould none the less give it no name the sense of seeing wasstrong in her but she clutched at the comfort of not being sureof what she saw not to know what it would represent on a longerview was a help in turn to not making out that her hands wereembrued since if she had stood in the position of a producingcause she should surely be less vague about what she hadproduced this further in its way was a step toward reflectingthat when one s connection with any matter was too indirect to betraced it might be described also as too slight to be deplored by the time they were nearing cadogan place she had in factrecognised that she couldn t be as curious as she desired withoutarriving at some conviction of her being as innocent but there had been a moment in the dim desert of eaton square when shebroke into speech it s only their defending themselves so much more than theyneed it s only that that makes me wonder it s their having soremarkably much to say for themselves her husband had as usual lighted his cigar remainingapparently as busy with it as she with her agitation you meanit makes you feel that you have nothing to which as she madeno answer the colonel added what in the world did you eversuppose was going to happen the man s in a position in which hehas nothing in life to do her silence seemed to characterise this statement as superficial and her thoughts as always in her husband s company pursued anindependent course he made her when they were together talk but as if for some other person who was in fact for the mostpart herself yet she addressed herself with him as she couldnever have done without him he has behaved beautifully he didfrom the first i ve thought it all along wonderful of him andi ve more than once when i ve had a chance told him so therefore therefore but it died away as she mused therefore he has a right for a change to kick up his heels it isn t a question of course however she undivertedly wenton of their behaving beautifully apart it s a question oftheir doing as they should when together which is anothermatter and how do you think then the colonel asked with interest that when together they should do the less they do one wouldsay the better if you see so much in it his wife at this appeared to hear him i don t see in it whatyou d see and don t my dear she further answered think itnecessary to be horrid or low about them they re the lastpeople really to make anything of that sort come in right i m surely never horrid or low he returned about anyone butmy extravagant wife i can do with all our friends as i see themmyself what i can t do with is the figures you make of them andwhen you take to adding your figures up but he exhaled itagain in smoke my additions don t matter when you ve not to pay the bill withwhich her meditation again bore her through the air the greatthing was that when it so suddenly came up for her he wasn tafraid if he had been afraid he could perfectly have preventedit and if i had seen he was if i hadn t seen he wasn t so said mrs assingham could i so she declared would i it sperfectly true she went on it was too good a thing for her such a chance in life not to be accepted and i liked his notkeeping her out of it merely from a fear of his own nature itwas so wonderful it should come to her the only thing would havebeen if charlotte herself couldn t have faced it then if shehad not had confidence we might have talked but she had it toany amount did you ask her how much bob assingham patiently inquired he had put the question with no more than his usual modest hopeof reward but he had pressed this time the sharpest spring ofresponse never never it wasn t a time to ask asking issuggesting and it wasn t a time to suggest one had to make upone s mind as quietly as possible by what one could judge andi judge as i say that charlotte felt she could face it forwhich she struck me at the time as for so proud a creature almost touchingly grateful the thing i should never forgive herfor would be her forgetting to whom it is her thanks haveremained most due that is to mrs assingham she said nothing for a little there were after all alternatives maggie herself of course astonishing littlemaggie is maggie then astonishing too and he gloomed out of hiswindow his wife on her side now as they rolled projected the samelook i m not sure that i don t begin to see more in her than dear little person as i ve always thought i ever supposed therewas i m not sure that putting a good many things together i mnot beginning to make her out rather extraordinary you certainly will if you can the colonel resignedly remarked again his companion said nothing then again she broke out infact i do begin to feel it maggie s the great comfort i mgetting hold of it it will be she who ll see us through in factshe ll have to and she ll be able touch by touch her meditation had completed it but with acumulative effect for her husband s general sense of her methodthat caused him to overflow whimsically enough in his corner into an ejaculation now frequent on his lips for the relief that especially in communion like the present it gave him and thatfanny had critically traced to the quaint example the aboriginalhomeliness still so delightful of mr verver oh lordy lordy if she is however mrs assingham continued she ll beextraordinary enough and that s what i m thinking of but i mnot indeed so very sure she added of the person to whomcharlotte ought in decency to be most grateful i mean i m notsure if that person is even almost the incredible little idealistwho has made her his wife i shouldn t think you would be love the colonel with somepromptness responded charlotte as the wife of an incrediblelittle idealist his cigar in short once more could aloneexpress it yet what is that when one thinks but just what she struck oneas more or less persuaded that she herself was really going tobe this memory for the full view fanny found herself alsoinvoking it made her companion in truth slightly gape an incrediblelittle idealist charlotte herself and she was sincere his wife simply proceeded she wasunmistakably sincere the question is only how much is left ofit and that i see happens to be another of the questions youcan t ask her you have to do it all said bob assingham as ifyou were playing some game with its rules drawn up though who sto come down on you if you break them i don t quite see or mustyou do it in three guesses like forfeits on christmas eve towhich as his ribaldry but dropped from her he further added how much of anything will have to be left for you to be able togo on with it i shall go on fanny assingham a trifle grimly declared whilethere s a scrap as big as your nail but we re not yet luckily reduced only to that she had another pause holding the whilethe thread of that larger perception into which her view of mrs verver s obligation to maggie had suddenly expanded even if herdebt was not to the others even then it ought to be quitesufficiently to the prince himself to keep her straight forwhat really did the prince do she asked herself butgenerously trust her what did he do but take it from her that ifshe felt herself willing it was because she felt herself strong that creates for her upon my word mrs assingham pursued aduty of considering him of honourably repaying his trust which well which she ll be really a fiend if she doesn t make thelaw of her conduct i mean of course his trust that she wouldn tinterfere with him expressed by his holding himself quiet at thecritical time the brougham was nearing home and it was perhaps this sense ofebbing opportunity that caused the colonel s next meditation toflower in a fashion almost surprising to his wife they wereunited for the most part but by his exhausted patience so thatindulgent despair was generally at the best his note he atpresent however actually compromised with his despair to theextent of practically admitting that he had followed her steps he literally asked in short an intelligent well nigh asympathising question gratitude to the prince for not havingput a spoke in her wheel that you mean should taking it inthe right way be precisely the ballast of her boat taking it in the right way fanny catching at this gleam emphasised the proviso but doesn t it rather depend on what she may most feel to be theright way no it depends on nothing because there s only one way forduty or delicacy oh delicacy bob assingham rather crudely murmured i mean the highest kind moral charlotte s perfectly capable ofappreciating that by every dictate of moral delicacy she mustlet him alone then you ve made up your mind it s all poor charlotte he askedwith an effect of abruptness the effect whether intended or not reached her brought herface short round it was a touch at which she again lost herbalance at which somehow the bottom dropped out of herrecovered comfort then you ve made up yours differently itreally struck you that there is something the movement itself apparently made him once more stand off hehad felt on his nearer approach the high temperature of thequestion perhaps that s just what she s doing showing him howmuch she s letting him alone pointing it out to him from day today did she point it out by waiting for him to night on the stair case in the manner you described to me i really my dear described to you a manner the colonel clearly from want of habit scarce recognised himself in theimputation yes for once in a way in those few words we had after you hadwatched them come up you told me something of what you had seen you didn t tell me very much that you couldn t for your life but i saw for myself that strange to say you had received yourimpression and i felt therefore that there must indeed have beensomething out of the way for you so to betray it she was fullyupon him now and she confronted him with his proved sensibilityto the occasion confronted him because of her own uneasy need toprofit by it it came over her still more than at the time itcame over her that he had been struck with something even he poor dear man and that for this to have occurred there must havebeen much to be struck with she tried in fact to corner him topack him insistently down in the truth of his plain vision thevery plainness of which was its value for so recorded she felt none of it would escape she should have it at hand forreference come my dear you thought what you thought in thepresence of what you saw you couldn t resist thinking i don task more of it than that and your idea is worth this time quite as much as any of mine so that you can t pretend asusual that mine has run away with me i haven t caught up withyou i stay where i am but i see she concluded where youare and i m much obliged to you for letting me you give me apoint de repere outside myself which is where i like it now ican work round you their conveyance as she spoke stopped at their door and itwas on the spot another fact of value for her that her husband though seated on the side by which they must alight made nomovement they were in a high degree votaries of the latch key so that their household had gone to bed and as they wereunaccompanied by a footman the coachman waited in peace it wasso indeed that for a minute bob assingham waited conscious of areason for replying to this address otherwise than by the soobvious method of turning his back he didn t turn his face buthe stared straight before him and his wife had already perceivedin the fact of his not moving all the proof she could desire proof that is of her own contention she knew he never caredwhat she said and his neglect of his chance to show it wasthereby the more eloquent leave it he at last remarked tothem leave it she wondered let them alone they ll manage they ll manage you mean to do everything they want ah therethen you are they ll manage in their own way the colonel almost crypticallyrepeated it had its effect for her quite apart from its light on thefamiliar phenomenon of her husband s indurated conscience itgave her full in her face the particular evocation of which shehad made him guilty it was wonderful truly then the evocation so cleverly that s your idea that no one will be the wiser it s your idea that we shall have done all that s required of usif we simply protect them the colonel still in his place declined however to be drawninto a statement of his idea statements were too much liketheories in which one lost one s way he only knew what he said and what he said represented the limited vibration of which hisconfirmed old toughness had been capable still none the less he had his point to make for which he took another instant buthe made it for the third time in the same fashion they llmanage in their own way with which he got out oh yes at this for his companion it had indeed its effect andwhile he mounted their steps she but stared without followinghim at his opening of their door their hall was lighted and ashe stood in the aperture looking back at her his tall leanfigure outlined in darkness and with his crush hat according tohis wont worn cavalierly rather diabolically askew he seemedto prolong the sinister emphasis of his meaning in general onthese returns he came back for her when he had prepared theirentrance so that it was now as if he were ashamed to face her incloser quarters he looked at her across the interval and stillin her seat weighing his charge she felt her whole view ofeverything flare up wasn t it simply what had been written inthe prince s own face beneath what he was saying didn t itcorrespond with the mocking presence there that she had had hertroubled glimpse of wasn t in fine the pledge that they would manage in their own way the thing he had been feeling for hischance to invite her to take from him her husband s tone somehowfitted amerigo s look the one that had for her so strangely peeped from behind over the shoulder of the one in front shehad not then read it but wasn t she reading it when she now sawin it his surmise that she was perhaps to be squared she wasn tto be squared and while she heard her companion call across toher well what s the matter she also took time to remindherself that she had decided she couldn t be frightened the matter why it was sufficiently the matter with all this that she felt a little sick for it was not the prince that shehad been prepared to regard as primarily the shaky one shakinessin charlotte she had at the most perhaps postulated it wouldbe she somehow felt more easy to deal with therefore if he hadcome so far it was a different pair of sleeves there was nothingto choose between them it made her so helpless that as the timepassed without her alighting the colonel came back and fairlydrew her forth after which on the pavement under thestreet lamp their very silence might have been the mark ofsomething grave their silence eked out for her by his giving herhis arm and their then crawling up their steps quite mildly andunitedly together like some old darby and joan who have had adisappointment it almost resembled a return from a funeral unless indeed it resembled more the hushed approach to a house ofmourning what indeed had she come home for but to bury asdecently as possible her mistake xviiit appeared thus that they might enjoy together extraordinaryfreedom the two friends from the moment they should understandtheir position aright with the prince himself from an earlystage not unnaturally charlotte had made a great point of theirso understanding it she had found frequent occasion to describeto him this necessity and her resignation tempered or herintelligence at least quickened by irrepressible irony sheapplied at different times different names to the propriety oftheir case the wonderful thing was that her sense of proprietyhad been from the first especially alive about it there werehours when she spoke of their taking refuge in what she calledthe commonest tact as if this principle alone would suffice tolight their way there were others when it might have seemed tolisten to her that their course would demand of them the mostanxious study and the most independent not to say original interpretation of signs she talked now as if it were indicated at every turn by finger posts of almost ridiculous prominence she talked again as if it lurked in devious ways and were to betracked through bush and briar and she even on occasion delivered herself in the sense that as their situation wasunprecedented so their heaven was without stars do sheonce had echoed to him as the upshot of passages covertly thoughbriefly occurring between them on her return from the visit toamerica that had immediately succeeded her marriage determinedfor her by this event as promptly as an excursion of the likestrange order had been prescribed in his own case isn t theimmense the really quite matchless beauty of our position thatwe have to do nothing in life at all nothing except theusual necessary everyday thing which consists in one s notbeing more of a fool than one can help that s all but that s astrue for one time as for another there has been plenty of doing and there will doubtless be plenty still but it s alltheirs every inch of it it s all a matter of what they ve doneto us and she showed how the question had therefore been onlyof their taking everything as everything came and all as quietlyas might be nothing stranger surely had ever happened to aconscientious a well meaning a perfectly passive pair no moreextraordinary decree had ever been launched against such victimsthan this of forcing them against their will into a relation ofmutual close contact that they had done everything to avoid she was to remember not a little meanwhile the particularprolonged silent look with which the prince had met her allusionto these primary efforts at escape she was inwardly to dwell onthe element of the unuttered that her tone had caused to play upinto his irresistible eyes and this because she considered withpride and joy that she had on the spot disposed of the doubt the question the challenge or whatever else might have been that such a look could convey he had been sufficiently off hisguard to show some little wonder as to their having plotted sovery hard against their destiny and she knew well enough ofcourse what in this connection was at the bottom of histhought and what would have sounded out more or less if he hadnot happily saved himself from words all men were brutes enoughto catch when they might at such chances for dissent for all thegood it really did them but the prince s distinction was inbeing one of the few who could check himself before acting on theimpulse this obviously was what counted in a man as delicacy if her friend had blurted or bungled he would have said in hissimplicity did we do everything to avoid it when we facedyour remarkable marriage quite handsomely of course using theplural taking his share of the case by way of a tribute ofmemory to the telegram she had received from him in paris aftermr verver had despatched to rome the news of their engagement that telegram that acceptance of the prospect proposed to them an acceptance quite other than perfunctory she had neverdestroyed though reserved for no eyes but her own it was stillcarefully reserved she kept it in a safe place from which veryprivately she sometimes took it out to read it over a laguerre comme a la guerre then it had been couched in the frenchtongue we must lead our lives as we see them but i am charmedwith your courage and almost surprised at my own the messagehad remained ambiguous she had read it in more lights than one it might mean that even without her his career was up hill workfor him a daily fighting matter on behalf of a good appearance and that thus if they were to become neighbours again the eventwould compel him to live still more under arms it might mean onthe other hand that he found he was happy enough and thataccordingly so far as she might imagine herself a danger shewas to think of him as prepared in advance as really seasonedand secure on his arrival in paris with his wife none the less she had asked for no explanation just as he himself had notasked if the document were still in her possession such aninquiry everything implied was beneath him just as it wasbeneath herself to mention to him uninvited that she hadinstantly offered and in perfect honesty to show the telegramto mr verver and that if this companion had but said the wordshe would immediately have put it before him she had therebyforborne to call his attention to her consciousness that such anexposure would in all probability straightway have dished hermarriage that all her future had in fact for the moment hungby the single hair of mr verver s delicacy as she supposed theymust call it and that her position in the matter ofresponsibility was therefore inattackably straight for the prince himself meanwhile time in its measuredallowance had originally much helped him helped him in thesense of there not being enough of it to trip him up in spite ofwhich it was just this accessory element that seemed at present with wonders of patience to lie in wait time had begotten atfirst more than anything else separations delays andintervals but it was troublesomely less of an aid from themoment it began so to abound that he had to meet the question ofwhat to do with it less of it was required for the state ofbeing married than he had on the whole expected less strangely for the state of being married even as he was married and there was a logic in the matter he knew a logic that butgave this truth a sort of solidity of evidence mr verver decidedly helped him with it with his wedded condition helpedhim really so much that it made all the difference in the degreein which he rendered it the service on mr verver s part wasremarkable as indeed what service from the first of theirmeeting had not been he was living he had been living thesefour or five years on mr verver s services a truth scarcelyless plain if he dealt with them for appreciation one by one than if he poured them all together into the general pot of hisgratitude and let the thing simmer to a nourishing broth to thelatter way with them he was undoubtedly most disposed yet hewould even thus on occasion pick out a piece to taste on itsown merits wondrous at such hours could seem the savour of theparticular treat at his father in law s expense that he moreand more struck himself as enjoying he had needed months andmonths to arrive at a full appreciation he couldn t originallyhave given offhand a name to his deepest obligation but by thetime the name had flowered in his mind he was practically livingat the ease guaranteed him mr verver then in a word took careof his relation to maggie as he took care and apparently alwayswould of everything else he relieved him of all anxiety abouthis married life in the same manner in which he relieved him onthe score of his bank account and as he performed the latteroffice by communicating with the bankers so the former sprang asdirectly from his good understanding with his daughter thisunderstanding had wonderfully that was in high evidence thesame deep intimacy as the commercial the financial associationfounded far down on a community of interest and thecorrespondence for the prince carried itself out in identitiesof character the vision of which fortunately rather tended toamuse than to as might have happened irritate him thosepeople and his free synthesis lumped together capitalists andbankers retired men of business illustrious collectors american fathers in law american fathers little americandaughters little american wives those people were of the samelarge lucky group as one might say they were all at least ofthe same general species and had the same general instincts theyhung together they passed each other the word they spoke eachother s language they did each other turns in this lastconnection it of course came up for our young man at a givenmoment that maggie s relation with him was also on the perceivedbasis taken care of which was in fact the real upshot of thematter it was a funny situation that is it was funny just asit stood their married life was in question but the solutionwas not less strikingly before them it was all right forhimself because mr verver worked it so for maggie s comfort and it was all right for maggie because he worked it so for herhusband s the fact that time however was not as we have said wholly onthe prince s side might have shown for particularly true one darkday on which by an odd but not unprecedented chance thereflections just noted offered themselves as his main recreation they alone it appeared had been appointed to fill the hours forhim and even to fill the great square house in portland place where the scale of one of the smaller saloons fitted them butloosely he had looked into this room on the chance that he mightfind the princess at tea but though the fireside service of therepast was shiningly present the mistress of the table was not and he had waited for her if waiting it could be called whilehe measured again and again the stretch of polished floor hecould have named to himself no pressing reason for seeing her atthis moment and her not coming in as the half hour elapsed became in fact quite positively however perversely thecircumstance that kept him on the spot just there he might havebeen feeling just there he could best take his note thisobservation was certainly by itself meagre amusement for a drearylittle crisis but his walk to and fro and in particular hisrepeated pause at one of the high front windows gave each of theebbing minutes none the less after a time a little more of thequality of a quickened throb of the spirit these throbs scarceexpressed however the impatience of desire any more than theystood for sharp disappointment the series together resembledperhaps more than anything else those fine waves of clearnessthrough which for a watcher of the east dawn at last tremblesinto rosy day the illumination indeed was all for the mind theprospect revealed by it a mere immensity of the world of thought the material outlook was all the while a different matter themarch afternoon judged at the window had blundered back intoautumn it had been raining for hours and the colour of therain the colour of the air of the mud of the opposite houses of life altogether in so grim a joke so idiotic a masquerade was an unutterable dirty brown there was at first even for theyoung man no faint flush in the fact of the direction taken while he happened to look out by a slow jogging four wheeled cabwhich awkwardly deflecting from the middle course at theapparent instance of a person within began to make for theleft hand pavement and so at last under further instructions floundered to a full stop before the prince s windows the personwithin alighting with an easier motion proved to be a lady wholeft the vehicle to wait and putting up no umbrella quicklycrossed the wet interval that separated her from the house shebut flitted and disappeared yet the prince from his standpoint had had time to recognise her and the recognition kept him forsome minutes motionless charlotte stant at such an hour in a shabby four wheeler and awaterproof charlotte stant turning up for him at the very climaxof his special inner vision was an apparition charged with acongruity at which he stared almost as if it had been a violence the effect of her coming to see him him only had while hestood waiting a singular intensity though after some minuteshad passed the certainty of this began to drop perhaps she hadnot come or had come only for maggie perhaps on learning belowthat the princess had not returned she was merely leaving amessage writing a word on a card he should see at any rate and meanwhile controlling himself would do nothing thisthought of not interfering took on a sudden force for him shewould doubtless hear he was at home but he would let her visitto him be all of her own choosing and his view of a reason forleaving her free was the more remarkable that though taking nostep he yet intensely hoped the harmony of her breaking intosight while the superficial conditions were so against her was aharmony with conditions that were far from superficial and thatgave for his imagination an extraordinary value to herpresence the value deepened strangely moreover with the rigourof his own attitude with the fact too that listening hard heneither heard the house door close again nor saw her go back toher cab and it had risen to a climax by the time he had becomeaware with his quickened sense that she had followed the butlerup to the landing from which his room opened if anything couldfurther then have added to it the renewed pause outside as ifshe had said to the man wait a moment would have constitutedthis touch yet when the man had shown her in had advanced tothe tea table to light the lamp under the kettle and had thenbusied himself all deliberately with the fire she made it easyfor her host to drop straight from any height of tension and tomeet her provisionally on the question of maggie while thebutler remained it was maggie that she had come to see and maggiethat in spite of this attendant s high blankness on the subjectof all possibilities on that lady s part she would cheerfully by the fire wait for as soon as they were alone together however she mounted as with the whizz and the red light of arocket from the form to the fact saying straight out as shestood and looked at him what else my dear what in the worldelse can we do it was as if he then knew on the spot why he had been feeling for hours as he had felt as if he in fact knew within theminute things he had not known even while she was panting asfrom the effect of the staircase at the door of the room heknew at the same time none the less that she knew still morethan he in the sense that is of all the signs and portentsthat might count for them and his vision of alternative shecould scarce say what to call them solutions satisfactions opened out altogether with this tangible truth of her attitudeby the chimney place the way she looked at him as through thegained advantage of it her right hand resting on the marble andher left keeping her skirt from the fire while she held out afoot to dry he couldn t have told what particular links and gapshad at the end of a few minutes found themselves renewed andbridged for he remembered no occasion in rome from which thepicture could have been so exactly copied he remembered thatis none of her coming to see him in the rain while a muddyfour wheeler waited and while though having left her waterproofdownstairs she was yet invested with the odd eloquence thepositive picturesqueness yes given all the rest of the matter of a dull dress and a black bowdlerised hat that seemed to make apoint of insisting on their time of life and their moralintention the hat s and the frock s own as well as on the ironyof indifference to them practically playing in her so handsomerain freshened face the sense of the past revived for himnevertheless as it had not yet done it made that other timesomehow meet the future close interlocking with it before hiswatching eyes as in a long embrace of arms and lips and sohandling and hustling the present that this poor quantity scarceretained substance enough scarce remained sufficiently there tobe wounded or shocked what had happened in short was that charlotte and he had by asingle turn of the wrist of fate led up to indeed no doubt by steps and stages that conscious computation had missed beenplaced face to face in a freedom that partook extraordinarily of ideal perfection since the magic web had spun itself withouttheir toil almost without their touch above all on thisoccasion once more there sounded through their safety as anundertone the very voice he had listened to on the eve of hismarriage with such another sort of unrest dimly again andagain from that period on he had seemed to hear it tell him whyit kept recurring but it phrased the large music now in a waythat filled the room the reason was into which he had lived quite intimately by the end of a quarter of an hour that justthis truth of their safety offered it now a kind of unexampledreceptacle letting it spread and spread but at the same timeelastically enclosing it banking it in for softness as withbillows of eiderdown on that morning in the park there hadbeen however dissimulated doubt and danger whereas the talethis afternoon was taken up with a highly emphasised confidence the emphasis for their general comfort was what charlotte hadcome to apply inasmuch as though it was not what she definitelybegan with it had soon irrepressibly shaped itself it was themeaning of the question she had put to him as soon as they werealone even though indeed as from not quite understanding hehad not then directly replied it was the meaning of everythingelse down to the conscious quaintness of her ricketty growler and the conscious humility of her dress it had helped him alittle the question of these eccentricities to let herimmediate appeal pass without an answer he could ask her insteadwhat had become of her carriage and why above all she was notusing it in such weather it s just because of the weather she explained it s mylittle idea it makes me feel as i used to when i could do as iliked xviiithis came out so straight that he saw at once how much truth itexpressed yet it was truth that still a little puzzled him butdid you ever like knocking about in such discomfort it seems to me now that i then liked everything it s the charm at any rate she said from her place at the fire of tryingagain the old feelings they come back they come back everything she went on comes back besides she wound up you know for yourself he stood near her his hands in his pockets but not looking ather looking hard at the tea table ah i haven t your courage moreover he laughed it seems to me that so far as that goes i do live in hansoms but you must awfully want your tea hequickly added so let me give you a good stiff cup he busied himself with this care and she sat down on hispushing up a low seat where she had been standing so that while she talked he could bring her what she further desired hemoved to and fro before her he helped himself and her visit asthe moments passed had more and more the effect of a signalcommunication that she had come all responsibly anddeliberately as on the clear show of the clock face of theirsituation to make the whole demonstration none the less presented itself as taking place at a very high level of debate in the cool upper air of the finer discrimination the deepersincerity the larger philosophy no matter what were the factsinvoked and arrayed it was only a question as yet of theirseeing their way together to which indeed exactly the presentoccasion appeared to have so much to contribute it s not thatyou haven t my courage charlotte said but that you haven t irather think my imagination unless indeed it should turn outafter all she added that you haven t even my intelligence however i shall not be afraid of that till you ve given me moreproof and she made again but more clearly her point of amoment before you knew besides you knew to day i would come and if you knew that you know everything so she pursued and ifhe didn t meanwhile if he didn t even at this take her up itmight be that she was so positively fitting him again with thefair face of temporising kindness that he had given her to keepher eyes on at the other important juncture and the sense ofwhich she might ever since have been carrying about with her likea precious medal not exactly blessed by the pope suspended roundher neck she had come back however this might be to herimmediate account of herself and no mention of their greatprevious passage was to rise to the lips of either above all she said there has been the personal romance of it of tea with me over the fire ah so far as that goes i don tthink even my intelligence fails me oh it s further than that goes and if i ve had a better daythan you it s perhaps when i come to think of it that i ambraver you bore yourself you see but i don t i don t idon t she repeated it s precisely boring one s self without relief he protested that takes courage passive then not active my romance is that if you want toknow i ve been all day on the town literally on the town isn tthat what they call it i know how it feels after which as ifbreaking off and you have you never been out she asked he still stood there with his hands in his pockets what shouldi have gone out for oh what should people in our case do anything for but you rewonderful all of you you know how to live we re clumsy brutes we other s beside you we must always be doing something however charlotte pursued if you had gone out you might havemissed the chance of me which i m sure though you won t confessit was what you didn t want and might have missed above all the satisfaction that look blank about it as you will i ve cometo congratulate you on that s really what i can at last do youcan t not know at least on such a day as this you can t notknow she said where you are she waited as for him either togrant that he knew or to pretend that he didn t but he only drewa long deep breath which came out like a moan of impatience itbrushed aside the question of where he was or what he knew itseemed to keep the ground clear for the question of his visitorherself that of charlotte verver exactly as she sat there so for some moments with their long look they but treated thematter in silence with the effect indeed by the end of thetime of having considerably brought it on this was sufficientlymarked in what charlotte next said there it all is extraordinary beyond words it makes such a relation for us as iverily believe was never before in the world thrust upon twowell meaning creatures haven t we therefore to take things as wefind them she put the question still more directly than that ofa moment before but to this one as well he returned noimmediate answer noticing only that she had finished her tea herelieved her of her cup carried it back to the table asked herwhat more she would have and then on her nothing thanks returned to the fire and restored a displaced log to position bya small but almost too effectual kick she had meanwhile got upagain and it was on her feet that she repeated the words she hadfirst frankly spoken what else can we do what in all the worldelse he took them up however no more than at first where then haveyou been he asked as from mere interest in her adventure everywhere i could think of except to see people i didn t wantpeople i wanted too much to think but i ve been back atintervals three times and then come away again my cabman mustthink me crazy it s very amusing i shall owe him when we cometo settle more money than he has ever seen i ve been my dear she went on to the british museum which you know i alwaysadore and i ve been to the national gallery and to a dozen oldbooksellers coming across treasures and i ve lunched on somestrange nastiness at a cookshop in holborn i wanted to go tothe tower but it was too far my old man urged that and i wouldhave gone to the zoo if it hadn t been too wet which he alsobegged me to observe but you wouldn t believe i did put in st paul s such days she wound up are expensive for besidesthe cab i ve bought quantities of books she immediatelypassed at any rate to another point i can t help wonderingwhen you must last have laid eyes on them and then as it hadapparently for her companion an effect of abruptness maggie imean and the child for i suppose you know he s with her oh yes i know he s with her i saw them this morning and did they then announce their programme she told me she was taking him as usual da nonno and for the whole day he hesitated but it was as if his attitude had slowly shifted she didn t say and i didn t ask well she went on it can t have been later than half pastten i mean when you saw them they had got to eaton squarebefore eleven you know we don t formally breakfast adam and i we have tea in our rooms at least i have but luncheon is early and i saw my husband this morning by twelve he was showing thechild a picture book maggie had been there with them had leftthem settled together then she had gone out taking the carriagefor something he had been intending but that she offered to doinstead the prince appeared to confess at this to his interest taking you mean your carriage i don t know which and it doesn t matter it s not a question she smiled of a carriage the more or the less it s not aquestion even if you come to that of a cab it s so beautiful she said that it s not a question of anything vulgar orhorrid which she gave him time to agree about and though hewas silent it was rather remarkably as if he fell in i wentout i wanted to i had my idea it seemed to me important ithas been it is important i know as i haven t known before theway they feel i couldn t in any other way have made so sure ofit they feel a confidence the prince observed he had indeed said it for her they feel a confidence and sheproceeded with lucidity to the fuller illustration of it speaking again of the three different moments that in the courseof her wild ramble had witnessed her return for curiosity andeven really a little from anxiety to eaton square she waspossessed of a latch key rarely used it had always irritatedadam one of the few things that did to find servants standingup so inhumanly straight when they came home in the small hours after parties so i had but to slip in each time with my cabat the door and make out for myself without their knowing it that maggie was still there i came i went without their somuch as dreaming what do they really suppose she asked becomes of one not so much sentimentally or morally so tocall it and since that doesn t matter but even just physically materially as a mere wandering woman as a decent harmless wife after all as the best stepmother after all that really everwas or at the least simply as a maitresse de maison not quitewithout a conscience they must even in their odd way shedeclared have some idea oh they ve a great deal of idea said the prince and nothingwas easier than to mention the quantity they think so much ofus they think in particular so much of you ah don t put it all on me she smiled but he was putting it now where she had admirably prepared theplace it s a matter of your known character ah thank you for known she still smiled it s a matter of your wonderful cleverness and wonderful charm it s a matter of what those things have done for you in theworld i mean in this world and this place you re a personagefor them and personages do go and come oh no my dear there you re quite wrong and she laughed nowin the happier light they had diffused that s exactly whatpersonages don t do they live in state and under constantconsideration they haven t latch keys but drums and trumpetsannounce them and when they go out in growlers it makes agreater noise still it s you caro mio she said who so faras that goes are the personage ah he in turn protested don t put it all on me what at anyrate when you get home he added shall you say that you vebeen doing i shall say beautifully that i ve been here all day yes all day keeping you company in your solitude how can weunderstand anything she went on without really seeing thatthis is what they must like to think i do for you just as quite as comfortably you do it for me the thing is for us tolearn to take them as they are he considered this a while in his restless way but with hiseyes not turning from her after which rather disconnectedly though very vehemently he brought out how can i not feel morethan anything else how they adore together my boy and then further as if slightly disconcerted she had nothing to meetthis and he quickly perceived the effect they would have donethe same for one of yours ah if i could have had one i hoped and i believed saidcharlotte that that would happen it would have been better itwould have made perhaps some difference he thought so too poorduck that it might have been i m sure he hoped and intended so it s not at any rate she went on my fault there it is shehad uttered these statements one by one gravely sadly andresponsibly owing it to her friend to be clear she pausedbriefly but as if once for all she made her clearnesscomplete and now i m too sure it will never be he waited for a moment never never they treated the matter not exactly with solemnity butwith a certain decency even perhaps urgency of distinctness it would probably have been better charlotte added butthings turn out and it leaves us she made the point morealone he seemed to wonder it leaves you more alone oh she again returned don t put it all on me maggie wouldhave given herself to his child i m sure scarcely less than hegives himself to yours it would have taken more than any childof mine she explained it would have taken more than tenchildren of mine could i have had them to keep our sposiapart she smiled as for the breadth of the image but as heseemed to take it in spite of this for important she thenspoke gravely enough it s as strange as you like but we reimmensely alone he kept vaguely moving but there were momentswhen again with an awkward ease and his hands in his pockets he was more directly before her he stood there at these lastwords which had the effect of making him for a little throw backhis head and as thinking something out stare up at the ceiling what will you say she meanwhile asked that you ve beendoing this brought his consciousness and his eyes back to her and she pointed her question i mean when she comes in for isuppose she will some time come in it seems to me we must saythe same thing well he thought again yet i can scarce pretend to have hadwhat i haven t ah what haven t you had what aren t you having her question rang out as they lingered face to face and he stilltook it before he answered from her eyes we must at leastthen not to be absurd together do the same thing we must act it would really seem in concert it would really seem her eyebrows her shoulders went up quite in gaiety as for the relief this brought her it s all inthe world i pretend we must act in concert heaven knows shesaid they do so it was that he evidently saw and that by his admission thecase could fairly be put but what he evidently saw appeared tocome over him at the same time as too much for him so that hefell back suddenly to ground where she was not awaiting him thedifficulty is and will always be that i don t understand them i didn t at first but i thought i should learn to that was whati hoped and it appeared then that fanny assingham might helpme oh fanny assingham said charlotte verver he stared a moment at her tone she would do anything for us to which charlotte at first said nothing as if from the sense oftoo much then indulgently enough she shook her head we rebeyond her he thought a moment as of where this placed them she d doanything then for them well so would we so that doesn t help us she has broken down she doesn t understand us and really my dear charlotte added fanny assingham doesn t matter he wondered again unless as taking care of them ah charlotte instantly said isn t it for us only to dothat she spoke as with a flare of pride for their privilege andtheir duty i think we want no one s aid she spoke indeed with a nobleness not the less effective forcoming in so oddly with a sincerity visible even through thecomplicated twist by which any effort to protect the father andthe daughter seemed necessarily conditioned for them it movedhim in any case as if some spring of his own a weaker one hadsuddenly been broken by it these things all the while theprivilege the duty the opportunity had been the substance ofhis own vision they formed the note he had been keeping back toshow her that he was not in their so special situation withouta responsible view a conception that he could name and couldact on was something that now at last not to be too eminent afool he was required by all the graces to produce and theluminous idea she had herself uttered would have been hisexpression of it she had anticipated him but as her expressionleft for positive beauty nothing to be desired he felt ratherrighted than wronged a large response as he looked at her cameinto his face a light of excited perception all his own in theglory of which as it almost might be called what he gave herback had the value of what she had given him they reextraordinarily happy oh charlotte s measure of it was only too full beatifically that s the great thing he went on so that it doesn t matter really that one doesn t understand besides you do enough i understand my husband perhaps she after an instant conceded i don t understand your wife you re of the same race at any rate more or less of the samegeneral tradition and education of the same moral paste thereare things you have in common with them but i on my side asi ve gone on trying to see if i haven t some of these thingstoo i on my side have more and more failed there seem at lastto be none worth mentioning i can t help seeing it i mdecidedly too different yet you re not charlotte made the important point toodifferent from me i don t know as we re not married that brings things out perhaps if we were he said you would find some abyss ofdivergence since it depends on that then she smiled i m safe as youare anyhow moreover as one has so often had occasion to feel and even to remark they re very very simple that makes sheadded a difficulty for belief but when once one has taken itin it makes less difficulty for action i have at last formyself i think taken it in i m not afraid he wondered a moment not afraid of what well generally of some beastly mistake especially of anymistake founded on one s idea of their difference for thatidea charlotte developed positively makes one so tender ah but rather well then there it is i can t put myself into maggie s skin ican t as i say it s not my fit i shouldn t be able as i seeit to breathe in it but i can feel that i d do anything toshield it from a bruise tender as i am for her too she wenton i think i m still more so for my husband he s in truth of asweet simplicity the prince turned over a while the sweet simplicity of mr verver well i don t know that i can choose at night all catsare grey i only see how for so many reasons we ought to standtoward them and how to do ourselves justice we do itrepresents for us a conscious care of every hour literally said charlotte she could rise to thehighest measure of the facts and for which we must trust eachother oh as we trust the saints in glory fortunately the princehastened to add we can with which as for the full assuranceand the pledge it involved their hands instinctively found theirhands it s all too wonderful firmly and gravely she kept his hand it s too beautiful and so for a minute they stood together as strongly held and asclosely confronted as any hour of their easier past even had seenthem they were silent at first only facing and faced onlygrasping and grasped only meeting and met it s sacred hesaid at last it s sacred she breathed back to him they vowed it gave itout and took it in drawn by their intensity more closelytogether then of a sudden through this tightened circle as atthe issue of a narrow strait into the sea beyond everythingbroke up broke down gave way melted and mingled their lipssought their lips their pressure their response and theirresponse their pressure with a violence that had sighed itselfthe next moment to the longest and deepest of stillnesses theypassionately sealed their pledge xixhe had taken it from her as we have seen moreover that fannyassingham didn t now matter the now he had even himselfsupplied as no more than fair to his sense of various earlierstages and though his assent remained scarce more than tacit his behaviour for the hour so fell into line that for manydays he kept postponing the visit he had promised his old friendon the occasion of their talk at the foreign office with regret none the less would he have seen it quite extinguished thattheory of their relation as attached pupil and kind instructressin which they had from the first almost equally found aconvenience it had been he no doubt who had most put itforward since his need of knowledge fairly exceeded her mildpretension but he had again and again repeated to her that heshould never without her have been where he was and she hadnot successfully concealed the pleasure it might give her tobelieve it even after the question of where he was had begun toshow itself as rather more closed than open to interpretation ithad never indeed before that evening come up as during thepassage at the official party and he had for the first time atthose moments a little disappointedly got the impression of acertain failure on the dear woman s part of something he wasaware of having always rather freely taken for granted in her ofwhat exactly the failure consisted he would still perhaps havefelt it a little harsh to try to say and if she had in fact asby charlotte s observation broken down the details of thecollapse would be comparatively unimportant they came to thesame thing all such collapses the failure of courage thefailure of friendship or the failure just simply of tact fordidn t any one of them by itself amount really to the failure ofwit which was the last thing he had expected of her and whichwould be but another name for the triumph of stupidity it hadbeen charlotte s remark that they were at last beyond her whereas he had ever enjoyed believing that a certain easyimagination in her would keep up with him to the end he shrankfrom affixing a label to mrs assingham s want of faith but whenhe thought at his ease of the way persons who were capablereally entertained or at least with any refinement the passionof personal loyalty he figured for them a play of fancy neithertimorous nor scrupulous so would his personal loyalty if needbe have accepted the adventure for the good creature herself tothat definite degree that he had positively almost missed theluxury of some such call from her that was what it all came backto again with these people among whom he was married that onefound one used one s imagination mainly for wondering how theycontrived so little to appeal to it he felt at moments as ifthere were never anything to do for them that was worthy to callworthy of the personal relation never any charming charge totake of any confidence deeply reposed he might vulgarly have putit that one had never to plot or to lie for them he mighthumourously have put it that one had never as by the higherconformity to lie in wait with the dagger or to prepare insidiously the cup these were the services that by allromantic tradition were consecrated to affection quite as muchas to hate but he could amuse himself with saying so far as theamusement went that they were what he had once for all turnedhis back on fanny was meanwhile frequent it appeared in eaton square somuch he gathered from the visitor who was not infrequent leastof all at tea time during the same period in portland place though they had little need to talk of her after practicallyagreeing that they had outlived her to the scene of theseconversations and suppressions mrs assingham herself made actually no approach her latest view of her utility seeming tobe that it had found in eaton square its most urgent field itwas finding there in fact everything and everyone but the prince who mostly just now kept away or who at all events on theinterspaced occasions of his calling happened not to encounterthe only person from whom he was a little estranged it wouldhave been all prodigious if he had not already with charlotte said so very considerably lived into it it would have been allindescribably remarkable this fact that with wonderful causesfor it so operating on the surface nobody else as yet in thecombination seemed estranged from anybody if mrs assinghamdelighted in maggie she knew by this time how most easily toreach her and if she was unhappy about charlotte she knew bythe same reasoning how most probably to miss that vision of heron which affliction would feed it might feed of course onfinding her so absent from her home just as this particularphenomenon of her domestic detachment could be by the anxiousmind best studied there fanny was however for her reasons shy of portland place itself this was appreciable so that shemight well after all have no great light on the question ofwhether charlotte s appearances there were frequent or not anymore than on that of the account they might be keeping of theusual solitude since it came to this of the head of that house there was always to cover all ambiguities to constitute a fundof explanation for the divisions of mrs verver s day thecircumstance that at the point they had all reached together mrs verver was definitely and by general acclamation in chargeof the social relations of the family literally of those ofthe two households as to her genius for representing which inthe great world and in the grand style vivid evidence had moreand more accumulated it had been established in the twohouseholds at an early stage and with the highest good humour that charlotte was a was the social success whereas theprincess though kind though punctilious though charming though in fact the dearest little creature in the world and theprincess into the bargain was distinctly not would distinctlynever be and might as well practically give it up whetherthrough being above it or below it too much outside of it or toomuch lost in it too unequipped or too indisposed didn tespecially matter what sufficed was that the whole thing callit appetite or call it patience the act of representation atlarge and the daily business of intercourse fell in withcharlotte s tested facility and not much less visibly with heraccommodating her generous view of her domestic use she hadcome frankly into the connection to do and to be what shecould no questions asked and she had taken over accordingly as it stood and in the finest practical spirit the burden of avisiting list that maggie originally left to herself and lefteven more to the principino had suffered to get inordinately outof hand she had in a word not only mounted cheerfully the londontreadmill she had handsomely professed herself for the furthercomfort of the three others sustained in the effort by a frivolous side if that were not too harsh a name for apleasant constitutional curiosity there were possibilities ofdulness ponderosities of practice arid social sands the badquarters of an hour that turned up like false pieces in a debasedcurrency of which she made on principle very nearly as lightas if she had not been clever enough to distinguish the princehad on this score paid her his compliment soon after her returnfrom her wedding tour in america where by all accounts she hadwondrously borne the brunt facing brightly at her husband sside everything that came up and what had come often wasbeyond words just as precisely with her own interest only atstake she had thrown up the game during the visit paid beforeher marriage the discussion of the american world thecomparison of notes impressions and adventures had been all athand as a ground of meeting for mrs verver and her husband sson in law from the hour of the reunion of the two couples thusit had been in short that charlotte could for her friend sappreciation so promptly make her point even using expressionsfrom which he let her see at the hour that he drew amusement ofhis own what could be more simple than one s going through witheverything she had asked when it s so plain a part of one scontract i ve got so much by my marriage for she had neverfor a moment concealed from him how much she had felt it andwas finding it that i should deserve no charity if i stinted myreturn not to do that to give back on the contrary all one can are just one s decency and one s honour and one s virtue thesethings henceforth if you re interested to know are my rule oflife the absolute little gods of my worship the holy images setup on the wall oh yes since i m not a brute she had wound up you shall see me as i am which was therefore as he had seenher dealing always from month to month from day to day andfrom one occasion to the other with the duties of a remuneratedoffice her perfect her brilliant efficiency had doubtless allthe while contributed immensely to the pleasant ease in whichher husband and her husband s daughter were lapped it had infact probably done something more than this it had given them afiner and sweeter view of the possible scope of that ease theyhad brought her in on the crudest expression of it to do the worldly for them and she had done it with such genius thatthey had themselves in consequence renounced it even more thanthey had originally intended in proportion as she did it moreover was she to be relieved of other and humbler doings which minor matters by the properest logic devolved thereforeupon maggie in whose chords and whose province they morenaturally lay not less naturally by the same token theyincluded the repair at the hands of the latter young woman ofevery stitch conceivably dropped by charlotte in eaton square this was homely work but that was just what made it maggie s bearing in mind dear amerigo who was so much of her own greatmundane feather and whom the homeliness in question didn t nodoubt quite equally provide for that would be to balance justin a manner charlotte s very most charming function from themoment charlotte could be got adequately to recognise it well that charlotte might be appraised as at last notineffectually recognising it was a reflection that during thedays with which we are actually engaged completed in theprince s breast these others these images and ruminations of hisleisure these gropings and fittings of his conscience and hisexperience that we have attempted to set in order there theybore him company not insufficiently considering in especial his fuller resources in that line while he worked out to thelast lucidity the principle on which he forbore either to seekfanny out in cadogan place or to perpetrate the error of toomarked an assiduity in eaton square this error would be his notavailing himself to the utmost of the convenience of any artlesstheory of his constitution or of charlotte s that might prevailthere that artless theories could and did prevail was a fact hehad ended by accepting under copious evidence as definite andultimate and it consorted with common prudence with thesimplest economy of life not to be wasteful of any odd gleaning to haunt eaton square in fine would be to show that he had not like his brilliant associate a sufficiency of work in the world it was just his having that sufficiency it was just their havingit together that so strangely and so blessedly made as theyput it to each other everything possible what further proppedup the case moreover was that the world by still anotherbeautiful perversity of their chance included portland placewithout including to anything like the same extent eaton square the latter residence at the same time it must promptly beadded did on occasion wake up to opportunity and as givingitself a frolic shake send out a score of invitations one ofwhich fitful flights precisely had before easter the effectof disturbing a little our young man s measure of his margin maggie with a proper spirit held that her father ought fromtime to time to give a really considered dinner and mr verver who had as little idea as ever of not meeting expectation was ofthe harmonious opinion that his wife ought charlotte s ownjudgment was always that they were ideally free the proof ofwhich would always be she maintained that everyone they fearedthey might most have alienated by neglect would arrive wreathedwith smiles on the merest hint of a belated signal wreathed insmiles all round truly enough these apologetic banquets struckamerigo as being they were frankly touching occasions to him marked in the great london bousculade with a small still graceof their own an investing amenity and humanity everybody came everybody rushed but all succumbed to the soft influence andthe brutality of mere multitude of curiosity without tenderness was put off at the foot of the fine staircase with theovercoats and shawls the entertainment offered a few eveningsbefore easter and at which maggie and he were inevitably presentas guests was a discharge of obligations not insistentlyincurred and had thereby possibly all the more the note ofthis almost arcadian optimism a large bright dull murmurous mild eyed middle aged dinner involving for the most part verybland though very exalted immensely announceable andhierarchically placeable couples and followed without theoppression of a later contingent by a brief instrumentalconcert over the preparation of which the prince knew maggie sanxiety had conferred with charlotte s ingenuity and both hadsupremely revelled as it were in mr verver s solvency the assinghams were there by prescription though quite at thefoot of the social ladder and with the colonel s wife in spiteof her humility of position the prince was more inwardlyoccupied than with any other person except charlotte he wasoccupied with charlotte because in the first place she lookedso inordinately handsome and held so high where so much else wasmature and sedate the torch of responsive youth and the standardof passive grace and because of the fact that in the second the occasion so far as it referred itself with any confidence ofemphasis to a hostess seemed to refer itself preferentially well meaningly and perversely to maggie it was notindistinguishable to him when once they were all stationed thathis wife too had in perfection her own little character but hewondered how it managed so visibly to simplify itself and this he knew in spite of any desire she entertained to the essentialair of having overmuch on her mind the felicity and indeed thevery conduct and credit of the feast he knew as well theother things of which her appearance was at any time and ineaton square especially made up her resemblance to her father at times so vivid and coming out in the delicate warmth ofoccasions like the quickened fragrance of a flower herresemblance as he had hit it off for her once in rome in thefirst flushed days after their engagement to a littledancing girl at rest ever so light of movement but most oftenpanting gently even a shade compunctiously on a bench herapproximation finally for it was analogy somehow more thanidentity to the transmitted images of rather neutral andnegative propriety that made up in his long line the average ofwifehood and motherhood if the roman matron had been insufficiency first and last the honour of that line maggiewould no doubt at fifty have expanded have solidified to somesuch dignity even should she suggest a little but a cornelia inminiature a light however broke for him in season and whenonce it had done so it made him more than ever aware of mrs verver s vaguely yet quite exquisitely contingentparticipation a mere hinted or tendered discretion in short ofmrs verver s indescribable unfathomable relation to the scene her placed condition her natural seat and neighbourhood herintenser presence her quieter smile her fewer jewels wereinevitably all as nothing compared with the preoccupation thatburned in maggie like a small flame and that had in fact kindledin each of her cheeks a little attesting but fortunately by nomeans unbecoming spot the party was her father s party and itsgreater or smaller success was a question having for her all theimportance of his importance so that sympathy created for her asort of visible suspense under pressure of which she bristledwith filial reference with little filial recalls of expression movement tone it was all unmistakable and as pretty aspossible if one would and even as funny but it put the pair sotogether as undivided by the marriage of each that the princessil n y avait pas a dire might sit where she liked she wouldstill always in that house be irremediably maggie verver theprince found himself on this occasion so beset with thatperception that its natural complement for him would really havebeen to wonder if mr verver had produced on people something ofthe same impression in the recorded cases of his having dinedwith his daughter this backward speculation had it begun to play however wouldhave been easily arrested for it was at present to come overamerigo as never before that his remarkable father in law was theman in the world least equipped with different appearances fordifferent hours he was simple he was a revelation ofsimplicity and that was the end of him so far as he consisted ofan appearance at all a question that might verily for aweakness in it have been argued it amused our young man whowas taking his pleasure to night it will be seen in sundryoccult ways it amused him to feel how everything else the masterof the house consisted of resources possessions facilities andamiabilities amplified by the social legend depended forconveying the effect of quantity on no personal equation nomere measurable medium quantity was in the air for these goodpeople and mr verver s estimable quality was almost wholly inthat pervasion he was meagre and modest and clearbrowed and hiseyes if they wandered without fear yet stayed without defiance his shoulders were not broad his chest was not high hiscomplexion was not fresh and the crown of his head was notcovered in spite of all of which he looked at the top of histable so nearly like a little boy shyly entertaining in virtueof some imposed rank that he could only be one of the powers the representative of a force quite as an infant king is therepresentative of a dynasty in this generalised view of hisfather in law intensified to night but always operative amerigohad now for some time taken refuge the refuge after the reunionof the two households in england had more and more offereditself as the substitute for communities from man to man that by his original calculation might have become possible but thathad not really ripened and flowered he met the decent familyeyes across the table met them afterwards in the music room butonly to read in them still what he had learned to read during hisfirst months the time of over anxious initiation a kind ofapprehension in which the terms and conditions were finally fixedand absolute this directed regard rested at its ease but itneither lingered nor penetrated and was to the prince s fancy much of the same order as any glance directed for due attention from the same quarter to the figure of a cheque received in thecourse of business and about to be enclosed to a banker it madesure of the amount and just so from time to time the amount ofthe prince was made sure he was being thus in renewedinstalments perpetually paid in he already reposed in the bankas a value but subject in this comfortable way to repeated toinfinite endorsement the net result of all of which moreover was that the young man had no wish to see his value diminish hehimself after all had not fixed it the figure was aconception all of mr verver s own certainly however everything must be kept up to it never so much as to night hadthe prince felt this he would have been uncomfortable as thesequiet expressions passed had the case not been guaranteed forhim by the intensity of his accord with charlotte it wasimpossible that he should not now and again meet charlotte seyes as it was also visible that she too now and again met herhusband s for her as well in all his pulses he felt theconveyed impression it put them it kept them together throughthe vain show of their separation made the two other faces madethe whole lapse of the evening the people the lights theflowers the pretended talk the exquisite music a mystic goldenbridge between them strongly swaying and sometimes almostvertiginous for that intimacy of which the sovereign law wouldbe the vigilance of care would be never rashly to forget andnever consciously to wound xxthe main interest of these hours for us however will have beenin the way the prince continued to know during a particularsuccession of others separated from the evening in eaton squareby a short interval a certain persistent aftertaste this wasthe lingering savour of a cup presented to him by fannyassingham s hand after dinner while the clustered quartette kepttheir ranged companions in the music room moved if one would but conveniently motionless mrs assingham contrived after acouple of pieces to convey to her friend that for her part shewas moved by the genius of brahms beyond what she could bear so that without apparent deliberation she had presently floatedaway at the young man s side to such a distance as permittedthem to converse without the effect of disdain it was the twentyminutes enjoyed with her during the rest of the concert in theless associated electric glare of one of the empty rooms it wastheir achieved and as he would have said successful mostpleasantly successful talk on one of the sequestered sofas itwas this that was substantially to underlie his consciousness ofthe later occasion the later occasion then mere matter ofdiscussion had formed her ground for desiring in a lightundertone into which his quick ear read indeed some nervousness these independent words with him she had sounded covertly butdistinctly by the time they were seated together the greatquestion of what it might involve it had come out for him beforeanything else and so abruptly that this almost needed anexplanation then the abruptness itself had appeared to explain which had introduced in turn a slight awkwardness do you knowthat they re not after all going to matcham so that if theydon t if at least maggie doesn t you won t i suppose go byyourself it was as i say at matcham where the event hadplaced him it was at matcham during the easter days that itmost befell him oddly enough to live over inwardly for itswealth of special significance this passage by which the eventhad been really a good deal determined he had paid first andlast many an english country visit he had learned even from ofold to do the english things and to do them all sufficiently in the english way if he didn t always enjoy them madly heenjoyed them at any rate as much to an appearance as the goodpeople who had in the night of time unanimously invented them and who still in the prolonged afternoon of their good faith unanimously even if a trifle automatically practised them yet with it all he had never so much as during such sojourns thetrick of a certain detached the amusement of a certain inwardcritical life the determined need which apparently allparticipant of returning upon itself of backing noiselessly in far in again and rejoining there as it were that part of hismind that was not engaged at the front his body veryconstantly was engaged at the front in shooting in riding ingolfing in walking over the fine diagonals of meadow paths orround the pocketed corners of billiard tables it sufficiently on the whole in fact bore the brunt of bridge playing ofbreakfasting lunching tea drinking dining and of the nightlyclimax over the bottigliera as he called it of the bristlingtray it met finally to the extent of the limited tax on lip on gesture on wit most of the current demands of conversationand expression therefore something of him he often felt atthese times was left out it was much more when he was alone orwhen he was with his own people or when he was say with mrs verver and nobody else that he moved that he talked that helistened that he felt as a congruous whole english society as he would have said cut him accordingly in two and he reminded himself often in his relations with it of a man possessed of a shining star a decoration an order ofsome sort something so ornamental as to make his identity notcomplete ideally without it yet who finding no other suchobject generally worn should be perpetually and the least bitruefully unpinning it from his breast to transfer it to hispocket the prince s shining star may no doubt having beennothing more precious than his private subtlety but whatever theobject was he just now fingered it a good deal out of sight amounting as it mainly did for him to a restless play of memoryand a fine embroidery of thought something had rathermomentously occurred in eaton square during his enjoyed minuteswith his old friend his present perspective made definitelyclear to him that she had plumped out for him her first littlelie that took on and he could scarce have said why a sharpnessof importance she had never lied to him before if only becauseit had never come up for her properly intelligibly morally that she must as soon as she had put to him the question of whathe would do by which she meant of what charlotte would also do in that event of maggie s and mr verver s not embracing theproposal they had appeared for a day or two resignedly toentertain as soon as she had betrayed her curiosity as to theline the other pair so left to themselves might take a desireto avoid the appearance of at all too directly prying had becomemarked in her betrayed by the solicitude of which she had already three weeks before given him a view she had beenobliged on a second thought to name intelligibly a reason forher appeal while the prince on his side had had not withoutmercy his glimpse of her momentarily groping for one and yetremaining unprovided not without mercy because absolutely hehad on the spot in his friendliness invented one for her use presenting it to her with a look no more significant than if hehad picked up to hand back to her a dropped flower you ask ifi m likely also to back out then because it may make adifference in what you and the colonel decide he had gone asfar as that for her fairly inviting her to assent though nothaving had his impression from any indication offered him bycharlotte that the assinghams were really in question for thelarge matcham party the wonderful thing after this was thatthe active couple had in the interval managed to inscribethemselves on the golden roll an exertion of a sort that to doher justice he had never before observed fanny to make thislast passage of the chapter but proved after all with whatsuccess she could work when she would once launched himself at any rate as he had been directed byall the terms of the intercourse between portland place and eatonsquare once steeped at matcham in the enjoyment of a splendidhospitality he found everything for his interpretation for hisconvenience fall easily enough into place and all the more thatmrs verver was at hand to exchange ideas and impressions with the great house was full of people of possible new combinations of the quickened play of possible propinquity and no appearance of course was less to be cultivated than that of his havingsought an opportunity to foregather with his friend at a safedistance from their respective sposi there was a happy boldness at the best in their mingling thus each unaccompanied in thesame sustained sociability just exactly a touch of thateccentricity of associated freedom which sat so lightly on theimagination of the relatives left behind they were exposed asmuch as one would to its being pronounced funny that they should at such a rate go about together though on the other hand this consideration drew relief from the fact that in their highconditions and with the easy tradition the almost inspiringallowances of the house in question no individual line howeverfreely marked was pronounced anything more than funny both ourfriends felt afresh as they had felt before the convenience ofa society so placed that it had only its own sensibility toconsider looking as it did well over the heads of all lowergrowths and that moreover treated its own sensibility quite asthe easiest friendliest most informal and domesticated party tothe general alliance what anyone thought of anyone else aboveall of anyone else with anyone else was a matter incurring inthese lulls so little awkward formulation that hovering judgment the spirit with the scales might perfectly have been imagedthere as some rather snubbed and subdued but quite trained andtactful poor relation of equal of the properest lineage onlyof aspect a little dingy doubtless from too limited a change ofdress for whose tacit and abstemious presence never betrayed bya rattle of her rusty machine a room in the attic and a plate atthe side table were decently usual it was amusing in suchlightness of air that the prince should again present himselfonly to speak for the princess so unfortunately unable again to leave home and that mrs verver should as regularly figure asan embodied a beautifully deprecating apology for her husband who was all geniality and humility among his own treasures butas to whom the legend had grown up that he couldn t bear withthe height of his standards and the tone of the company in theway of sofas and cabinets habitually kept by him the irritationand depression to

was above all for courageand good humour and the value of this as a general assurance that is for seeing one through at the worst had not even in theeasiest hours of his old roman life struck the prince soconvincingly his old roman life had had more poetry no doubt but as he looked back upon it now it seemed to hang in the air ofmere iridescent horizons to have been loose and vague and thin with large languorous unaccountable blanks the present order asit spread about him had somehow the ground under its feet and atrumpet in its ears and a bottomless bag of solid shiningbritish sovereigns which was much to the point in its hand courage and good humour therefore were the breath of the day though for ourselves at least it would have been also much to thepoint that with amerigo really the innermost effect of allthis perceptive ease was perhaps a strange final irritation hecompared the lucid result with the extraordinary substitute forperception that presided in the bosom of his wife at socontented a view of his conduct and course a state of mind thatwas positively like a vicarious good conscience cultivatedingeniously on his behalf a perversity of pressure innocentlypersisted in and this wonder of irony became on occasion toointense to be kept wholly to himself it wasn t that at matcham anything particular anything monstrous anything that had to benoticed permitted itself as they said to happen there wereonly odd moments when the breath of the day as it has beencalled struck him so full in the face that he broke out with allthe hilarity of what indeed would they have made of it they were of course maggie and her father moping so far as they everconsented to mope in monotonous eaton square but placid too inthe belief that they knew beautifully what their expertcompanions were in for they knew it might have appeared inthese lights absolutely nothing on earth worth speaking of whether beautifully or cynically and they would perhapssometimes be a little less trying if they would only once for allpeacefully admit that knowledge wasn t one of their needs andthat they were in fact constitutionally inaccessible to it theywere good children bless their hearts and the children of goodchildren so that verily the principino himself as lessconsistently of that descent might figure to the fancy as theripest genius of the trio the difficulty was for the nerves of daily intercourse withmaggie in particular that her imagination was clearly neverruffled by the sense of any anomaly the great anomaly would havebeen that her husband or even that her father s wife shouldprove to have been made for the long run after the pattern setfrom so far back to the ververs if one was so made one hadcertainly no business on any terms at matcham whereas if onewasn t one had no business there on the particular terms termsof conformity with the principles of eaton square under whichone had been so absurdly dedicated deep at the heart of thatresurgent unrest in our young man which we have had to contentourselves with calling his irritation deep in the bosom of thisfalsity of position glowed the red spark of his inextinguishablesense of a higher and braver propriety there were situationsthat were ridiculous but that one couldn t yet help as forinstance when one s wife chose in the most usual way to makeone so precisely here however was the difference it had takenpoor maggie to invent a way so extremely unusual yet to which none the less it would be too absurd that he should merely lendhimself being thrust systematically with another woman and awoman one happened by the same token exceedingly to like andbeing so thrust that the theory of it seemed to publish one asidiotic or incapable this was a predicament of which the dignitydepended all on one s own handling what was supremely grotesque in fact was the essential opposition of theories as if agalantuomo as he at least constitutionally conceivedgalantuomini could do anything but blush to go about at such arate with such a person as mrs verver in a state of childlikeinnocence the state of our primitive parents before the fall the grotesque theory as he would have called it was perhaps anodd one to resent with violence and he did it also as a man ofthe world all merciful justice but assuredly none the less there was but one way really to mark and for his companion asmuch as for himself the commiseration in which they held it adequate comment on it could only be private but it could alsoat least be active and of rich and effectual comment charlotteand he were fortunately alike capable wasn t this consensusliterally their only way not to be ungracious it was positivelyas if the measure of their escape from that danger were given bythe growth between them during their auspicious visit of anexquisite sense of complicity xxihe found himself therefore saying with gaiety even to fannyassingham for their common concerned glance at eaton square the glance that was so markedly never as it might have been aglance at portland place what would our cari sposi have made ofit here what would they you know really which overflowwould have been reckless if already and surprisingly perhapseven to himself he had not got used to thinking of this friendas a person in whom the element of protest had of late beenunmistakably allayed he exposed himself of course to herreplying ah if it would have been so bad for them how can itbe so good for you but quite apart from the small sense thequestion would have had at the best she appeared already tounite with him in confidence and cheer he had his view aswell or at least a partial one of the inner spring of thispresent comparative humility which was all consistent with theretraction he had practically seen her make after mr verver slast dinner without diplomatising to do so with no effort tosquare her none to bribe her to an attitude for which he wouldhave had no use in her if it were not sincere he yet felt how heboth held her and moved her by the felicity of his taking pity all instinctively on her just discernible depression by just somuch as he guessed that she felt herself as the slang was outof it out of the crystal current and the expensive picture byjust so much had his friendship charmingly made up to her fromhour to hour for the penalties as they might have been grosslycalled of her mistake her mistake had only been after all inher wanting to seem to him straight she had let herself in forbeing as she had made haste for that matter during the veryfirst half hour at tea to proclaim herself the sole and singlefrump of the party the scale of everything was so different thatall her minor values her quainter graces her little localauthority her humour and her wardrobe alike for which it wasenough elsewhere among her bons amis that they were hers dearfanny assingham s these matters and others would be all now asnought five minutes had sufficed to give her the fatal pitch incadogan place she could always at the worst be picturesque forshe habitually spoke of herself as local to sloane streetwhereas at matcham she should never be anything but horrible andit all would have come the disaster from the real refinement in her of the spirit of friendship to prove to him that shewasn t really watching him ground for which would have been tooterribly grave she had followed him in his pursuit of pleasure so she might precisely mark her detachment this was handsometrouble for her to take the prince could see it all it wasn t ashade of interference that a good natured man would visit on her so he didn t even say when she told him how frumpy she knewherself how frumpy her very maid odiously going back on her rubbed it into her night and morning with unsealed eyes andlips that she now knew her he didn t then say ah see whatyou ve done isn t it rather your own fault he behaveddifferently altogether eminently distinguished himself for shetold him she had never seen him so universally distinguished heyet distinguished her in her obscurity or in what was worse herobjective absurdity and frankly invested her with her absolutevalue surrounded her with all the importance of her wit thatwit as discriminated from stature and complexion a sense for bridge and a credit for pearls could have importance wasmeanwhile but dimly perceived at matcham so that his niceness to her she called it only niceness but it brought tears intoher eyes had the greatness of a general as well as of a specialdemonstration she understands he said as a comment on all this to mrs verver she understands all she needs to understand she hastaken her time but she has at last made it out for herself shesees how all we can desire is to give them the life they prefer to surround them with the peace and quiet and above all with thesense of security most favourable to it she can t of coursevery well put it to us that we have so far as she is concerned but to make the best of our circumstances she can t say in somany words don t think of me for i too must make the best ofmine arrange as you can only and live as you must i don tget quite that from her any more than i ask for it but her toneand her whole manner mean nothing at all unless they mean thatshe trusts us to take as watchful to take as artful to take astender care in our way as she so anxiously takes in hers sothat she s well the prince wound up what you may callpractically all right charlotte in fact however to help outhis confidence didn t call it anything return as he might tothe lucidity the importance or whatever it was of this lesson she gave him no aid toward reading it aloud she let him two orthree times over spell it out for himself only on the eve oftheir visit s end was she for once clear or direct in response they had found a minute together in the great hall of the houseduring the half hour before dinner this easiest of chances theyhad already a couple of times arrived at by waitingpersistently till the last other loiterers had gone to dress andby being prepared themselves to dress so expeditiously that theymight a little later on be among the first to appear in festalarray the hall then was empty before the army of rearranging cushion patting housemaids were marshalled in and there was aplace by the forsaken fire at one end where they might imitate with art the unpremeditated above all here for the snatchedinstants they could breathe so near to each other that theinterval was almost engulfed in it and the intensity both of theunion and the caution became a workable substitute for contact they had prolongations of instants that counted as visions ofbliss they had slow approximations that counted as longcaresses the quality of these passages in truth made thespoken word and especially the spoken word about other people fall below them so that our young woman s tone had even now acertain dryness it s very good of her my dear to trust us but what else can she do why whatever people do when they don t trust let one see theydon t but let whom see well let me say to begin with and should you mind that he had a slight show of surprise shouldn t you her letting you see no said charlotte the only thing i canimagine myself minding is what you yourself if you don t lookout may let her see to which she added you may let her see you know that you re afraid i m only afraid of you a little at moments he presentlyreturned but i shan t let fanny see that it was clear however that neither the limits nor the extent ofmrs assingham s vision were now a real concern to her and shegave expression to this as she had not even yet done what inthe world can she do against us there s not a word that she canbreathe she s helpless she can t speak she would be herselfthe first to be dished by it and then as he seemed slow tofollow it all comes back to her it all began with her everything from the first she introduced you to maggie shemade your marriage the prince might have had his moment of demur but at this aftera little as with a smile dim but deep he came on mayn t shealso be said a good deal to have made yours that was intended i think wasn t it for a kind of rectification charlotte on her side for an instant hesitated then she wasprompter still i don t mean there was anything to rectify everything was as it had to be and i m not speaking of how shemay have been concerned for you and me i m speaking of how shetook in her way each time their lives in hand and how therefore that ties her up to day she can t go to them and say it s very awkward of course you poor dear things but i wasfrivolously mistaken he took it in still with his long look at her all the morethat she wasn t she was right everything s right he went on and everything will stay so then that s all i say but he worked it out for the deeper satisfaction even tosuperfluous lucidity we re happy and they re happy what moredoes the position admit of what more need fanny assingham want ah my dear said charlotte it s not i who say that she needwant anything i only say that she s fixed that she must standexactly where everything has by her own act placed her it syou who have seemed haunted with the possibility for her ofsome injurious alternative something or other we must beprepared for and she had with her high reasoning a strangecold smile we are prepared for anything for everything andas we are practically so she must take us she s condemned toconsistency she s doomed poor thing to a genial optimism that luckily for her however is very much the law of hernature she was born to soothe and to smooth now then therefore mrs verver gently laughed she has the chance ofher life so that her present professions may even at the best not besincere may be but a mask for doubts and fears and for gainingtime the prince had looked with the question as if this again could trouble him and it determined in his companion a slightimpatience you keep talking about such things as if they wereour affair at all i feel at any rate that i ve nothing to dowith her doubts and fears or with anything she may feel shemust arrange all that for herself it s enough for me that she llalways be of necessity much more afraid for herself really either to see or to speak than we should be to have her do iteven if we were the idiots and cowards we aren t andcharlotte s face with these words to the mitigation of theslightly hard ring there might otherwise have been in them fairly lightened softened shone out it reflected as reallynever yet the rare felicity of their luck it made her look forthe moment as if she had actually pronounced that word ofunpermitted presumption so apt is the countenance as with afiner consciousness than the tongue to betray a sense of thisparticular lapse she might indeed the next instant have seenher friend wince in advance at her use of a word that wasalready on her lips for it was still unmistakable with him thatthere were things he could prize forms of fortune he couldcherish without at all proportionately liking their names hadall this however been even completely present to his companion what other term could she have applied to the strongest andsimplest of her ideas but the one that exactly fitted it sheapplied it then though her own instinct moved her at the sametime to pay her tribute to the good taste from which they hadn theretofore by a hair s breadth deviated if it didn t sound sovulgar i should say that we re fatally as it were safe pardonthe low expression since it s what we happen to be we re sobecause they are and they re so because they can t be anythingelse from the moment that having originally intervened forthem she wouldn t now be able to bear herself if she didn t keepthem so that s the way she s inevitably with us said charlotteover her smile we hang essentially together well the prince candidly allowed she did bring it home to him every way it worked out yes i see we hang essentially together his friend had a shrug a shrug that had a grace cosavolete the effect beautifully nobly was more than roman ah beyond doubt it s a case he stood looking at her it s a case there can t he said have been many perhaps never never never any other that she smiled iconfess i should like to think only ours only ours most probably speriamo to which as after hushedconnections he presently added poor fanny but charlotte hadalready with a start and a warning hand turned from a glance atthe clock she sailed away to dress while he watched her reachthe staircase his eyes followed her till with a simple swiftlook round at him she vanished something in the sight however appeared to have renewed the spring of his last exclamation which he breathed again upon the air poor poor fanny it was to prove however on the morrow quite consistent withthe spirit of these words that the party at matcham breaking upand multitudinously dispersing he should be able to meet thequestion of the social side of the process of repatriation withdue presence of mind it was impossible for reasons that heshould travel to town with the assinghams it was impossible forthe same reasons that he should travel to town save in theconditions that he had for the last twenty four hours beenprivately and it might have been said profoundly thinking out the result of his thought was already precious to him and thisput at his service he sufficiently believed the right tone fordisposing of his elder friend s suggestion an assumption in factequally full and mild that he and charlotte would convenientlytake the same train and occupy the same compartment as thecolonel and herself the extension of the idea to mrs verver hadbeen precisely a part of mrs assingham s mildness and nothingcould better have characterised her sense for social shades thanher easy perception that the gentleman from portland place andthe lady from eaton square might now confess quite withoutindiscretion to simultaneity of movement she had made for thefour days no direct appeal to the latter personage but theprince was accidental witness of her taking a fresh start at themoment the company were about to scatter for the last night oftheir stay there had been at this climax the usual preparatorytalk about hours and combinations in the midst of which poorfanny gently approached mrs verver she said you and theprince love quite apparently without blinking she took forgranted their public withdrawal together she remarked that sheand bob were alike ready in the interest of sociability to takeany train that would make them all one party i feel really asif all this time i had seen nothing of you that gave an addedgrace to the candour of the dear thing s approach but just thenit was on the other hand that the young man found himselfborrow most effectively the secret of the right tone for doing ashe preferred his preference had during the evening not failedof occasion to press him with mute insistences practicallywithout words without any sort of straight telegraphy it hadarrived at a felt identity with charlotte s own she spoke allfor their friend while she answered their friend s question butshe none the less signalled to him as definitely as if she hadfluttered a white handkerchief from a window it s awfully sweetof you darling our going together would be charming but youmustn t mind us you must suit yourselves we ve settled amerigoand i to stay over till after luncheon amerigo with the chink of this gold in his ear turned straightaway so as not to be instantly appealed to and for the veryemotion of the wonder furthermore of what divination mayachieve when winged by a community of passion charlotte haduttered the exact plea that he had been keeping ready for thesame foreseen necessity and had uttered it simply as aconsequence of their deepening unexpressed need of each other andwithout the passing between them of a word he hadn t god knew to take it from her he was too conscious of what he wanted butthe lesson for him was in the straight clear tone that charlottecould thus distil in the perfect felicity of her adding noexplanation no touch for plausibility that she wasn t strictlyobliged to add and in the truly superior way in which women sosituated express and distinguish themselves she had answeredmrs assingham quite adequately she had not spoiled it by areason a scrap larger than the smallest that would serve and shehad above all thrown off for his stretched but coveredattention an image that flashed like a mirror played at the faceof the sun the measure of everything to all his sense at thesemoments was in it the measure especially of the thought thathad been growing with him a positive obsession and that began tothrob as never yet under this brush of her having by perfectparity of imagination the match for it his whole consciousnesshad by this time begun almost to ache with a truth of anexquisite order at the glow of which she too had sounmistakably then been warming herself the truth that theoccasion constituted by the last few days couldn t possibly saveby some poverty of their own refuse them some still other andstill greater beauty it had already told them with an hourlyvoice that it had a meaning a meaning that their associatedsense was to drain even as thirsty lips after the plough throughthe sands and the sight afar of the palm cluster might drinkin at last the promised well in the desert there had beenbeauty day after day and there had been for the spirituallips something of the pervasive taste of it yet it was all none the less as if their response had remained below theirfortune how to bring it by some brave free lift up to thesame height was the idea with which behind and beneatheverything he was restlessly occupied and in the exploration ofwhich as in that of the sun chequered greenwood of romance hisspirit thus at the opening of a vista met hers they werealready from that moment so hand in hand in the place that hefound himself making use five minutes later of exactly the sametone as charlotte s for telling mrs assingham that he waslikewise in the matter of the return to london sorry for whatmightn t be this had become of a sudden the simplest thing in the world the sense of which moreover seemed really to amount to a portentthat he should feel forevermore on the general head conveniently at his ease with her he went in fact a step furtherthan charlotte put the latter forward as creating his necessity she was staying over luncheon to oblige their hostess as aconsequence of which he must also stay to see her decently home he must deliver her safe and sound he felt in eaton square regret as he might too the difference made by this obligation he frankly didn t mind inasmuch as over and above the pleasureitself his scruple would certainly gratify both mr verver andmaggie they never yet had absolutely and entirely learned heeven found deliberation to intimate how little he reallyneglected the first as it seemed nowadays quite to have become of his domestic duties therefore he still constantly felt howlittle he must remit his effort to make them remark it to whichhe added with equal lucidity that they would return in time fordinner and if he didn t as a last word subjoin that it wouldbe lovely of fanny to find on her own return a moment to goto eaton square and report them as struggling bravely on thiswas not because the impulse down to the very name for theamiable act altogether failed to rise his inward assurance hisgeneral plan had at moments where she was concerned its dropsof continuity and nothing would less have pleased him than thatshe should suspect in him however tempted any element ofconscious cheek but he was always that was really theupshot cultivating thanklessly the considerate and the delicate it was a long lesson this unlearning with people of englishrace all the little superstitions that accompany friendship mrs assingham herself was the first to say that she wouldunfailingly report she brought it out in fact he thought quite wonderfully having attained the summit of the wonderfulduring the brief interval that had separated her appeal tocharlotte from this passage with himself she had taken the fiveminutes obviously amid the rest of the talk and the movement to retire into her tent for meditation which showed amongseveral things the impression charlotte had made on her it wasfrom the tent she emerged as with arms refurbished though whoindeed could say if the manner in which she now met him spokemost really of the glitter of battle or of the white waver ofthe flag of truce the parley was short either way the gallantryof her offer was all sufficient i ll go to our friends then i ll ask for luncheon i ll tellthem when to expect you that will be charming say we re all right all right precisely i can t say more mrs assingham smiled no doubt but he considered as for the possible importance ofit neither can you by what i seem to feel say less oh i won t say less fanny laughed with which the nextmoment she had turned away but they had it again not lessbravely on the morrow after breakfast in the thick of theadvancing carriages and the exchange of farewells i think i llsend home my maid from euston she was then prepared to amend and go to eaton square straight so you can be easy oh i think we re easy the prince returned be sure to say at any rate that we re bearing up you re bearing up good and charlotte returns to dinner to dinner we re not likely i think to make another nightaway well then i wish you at least a pleasant day oh he laughed as they separated we shall do our best forit after which in due course with the announcement of theirconveyance the assinghams rolled off xxiiit was quite for the prince after this as if the view hadfurther cleared so that the half hour during which he strolledon the terrace and smoked the day being lovely overflowed withthe plenitude of its particular quality its general brightnesswas composed doubtless of many elements but what shone out ofit as if the whole place and time had been a great picture fromthe hand of genius presented to him as a prime ornament for hiscollection and all varnished and framed to hang up what markedit especially for the highest appreciation was hisextraordinarily unchallenged his absolutely appointed andenhanced possession of it poor fanny assingham s challengeamounted to nothing one of the things he thought of while heleaned on the old marble balustrade so like others that he knewin still more nobly terraced italy was that she was squared all conveniently even to herself and that rumbling towardlondon with this contentment she had become an image irrelevantto the scene it further passed across him as his imaginationwas for reasons during the time unprecedentedly active thathe had after all gained more from women than he had ever lostby them there appeared so more and more on those mystic booksthat are kept in connection with such commerce even by men ofthe loosest business habits a balance in his favour that hecould pretty well as a rule take for granted what were theydoing at this very moment wonderful creatures but combine andconspire for his advantage from maggie herself most wonderful in her way of all to his hostess of the present hour intowhose head it had so inevitably come to keep charlotte on forreasons of her own and who had asked in this benevolent spirit why in the world if not obliged without plausibility to hurry her husband s son in law should not wait over in her company hewould at least see lady castledean had said that nothingdreadful should happen to her either while still there or duringthe exposure of the run to town and for that matter if theyexceeded a little their license it would positively help them tohave done so together each of them would in this way at home have the other comfortably to blame all of which besides inlady castledean as in maggie in fanny assingham as in charlotteherself was working for him without provocation or pressure bythe mere play of some vague sense on their part definite andconscious at the most only in charlotte that he was not as anature as a character as a gentleman in fine below hisremarkable fortune but there were more things before him than even these thingsthat melted together almost indistinguishably to feed his senseof beauty if the outlook was in every way spacious and thetowers of three cathedrals in different counties as had beenpointed out to him gleamed discernibly like dim silver in therich sameness of tone didn t he somehow the more feel it sobecause precisely lady castledean had kept over a man of herown and that this offered a certain sweet intelligibility as thenote of the day it made everything fit above all it divertedhim to the extent of keeping up while he lingered and waited his meditative smile she had detained charlotte because shewished to detain mr blint and she couldn t detain mr blint disposed though he clearly was to oblige her without spreadingover the act some ampler drapery castledean had gone up tolondon the place was all her own she had had a fancy for aquiet morning with mr blint a sleek civil accomplished youngman distinctly younger than her ladyship who played and sangdelightfully played even bridge and sang the english comic aswell as the french tragic and the presence which really meantthe absence of a couple of other friends if they were happilychosen would make everything all right the prince had thesense all good humouredly of being happily chosen and it wasnot spoiled for him even by another sense that followed in itstrain and with which during his life in england he had morethan once had reflectively to deal the state of being remindedhow after all as an outsider a foreigner and even as a mererepresentative husband and son in law he was so irrelevant tothe working of affairs that he could be bent on occasion to usescomparatively trivial no other of her guests would have beenthus convenient for their hostess affairs of whatever sorts had claimed by early trains every active easy smoothly working man each in his way a lubricated item of thegreat social political administrative engrenage claimed mostof all castledean himself who was so very oddly given thepersonage and the type rather a large item if he on the otherhand had an affair it was not of that order it was of theorder verily that he had been reduced to as a not quiteglorious substitute it marked however the feeling of the hour with him that thisvision of being reduced interfered not at all with the measureof his actual ease it kept before him again at moments the sofamiliar fact of his sacrifices down to the idea of the veryrelinquishment for his wife s convenience of his real situationin the world with the consequence thus that he was in thelast analysis among all these so often inferior people practically held cheap and made light of but though all this wassensible enough there was a spirit in him that could rise aboveit a spirit that positively played with the facts with all ofthem from that of the droll ambiguity of english relations tothat of his having in mind something quite beautiful andindependent and harmonious something wholly his own he couldn tsomehow take mr blint seriously he was much more an outsider by the larger scale even than a roman prince who consented to bein abeyance yet it was past finding out either how such awoman as lady castledean could take him since this question butsank for him again into the fathomless depths of englishequivocation he knew them all as was said well he had livedwith them stayed with them dined hunted shot and done variousother things with them but the number of questions about them hecouldn t have answered had much rather grown than shrunken sothat experience struck him for the most part as having left inhim but one residual impression they didn t like les situationsnettes that was all he was very sure of they wouldn t have themat any price it had been their national genius and theirnational success to avoid them at every point they called itthemselves with complacency their wonderful spirit ofcompromise the very influence of which actually so hung abouthim here from moment to moment that the earth and the air thelight and the colour the fields and the hills and the sky theblue green counties and the cold cathedrals owed to it everyaccent of their tone verily as one had to feel in presence ofsuch a picture it had succeeded it had made up to now forthat seated solidity in the rich sea mist on which the garish the supposedly envious peoples have ever cooled their eyes butit was at the same time precisely why even much initiation leftone at given moments so puzzled as to the element of stalenessin all the freshness and of freshness in all the staleness ofinnocence in the guilt and of guilt in the innocence there wereother marble terraces sweeping more purple prospects on whichhe would have known what to think and would have enjoyed therebyat least the small intellectual fillip of a discerned relationbetween a given appearance and a taken meaning the inquiringmind in these present conditions might it was true be moresharply challenged but the result of its attention and itsingenuity it had unluckily learned to know was too often to beconfronted with a mere dead wall a lapse of logic a confirmedbewilderment and moreover above all nothing mattered in therelation of the enclosing scene to his own consciousness but itsvery most direct bearings lady castledean s dream of mr blint for the morning wasdoubtless already with all the spacious harmonies re established taking the form of going over something with him at the piano in one of the numerous smaller rooms that wereconsecrated to the less gregarious uses what she had wished hadbeen effected her convenience had been assured this made him however wonder the more where charlotte was since he didn t atall suppose her to be making a tactless third which would be tohave accepted mere spectatorship in the duet of theircompanions the upshot of everything for him alike of the lessand of the more was that the exquisite day bloomed there like alarge fragrant flower that he had only to gather but it was tocharlotte he wished to make the offering and as he moved alongthe terrace which rendered visible parts of two sides of thehouse he looked up at all the windows that were open to theapril morning and wondered which of them would represent hisfriend s room it befell thus that his question after no longtime was answered he saw charlotte appear above as if she hadbeen called by the pausing of his feet on the flags she had cometo the sill on which she leaned to look down and she remainedthere a minute smiling at him he had been immediately struckwith her wearing a hat and a jacket which conduced to herappearance of readiness not so much to join him with a beautifuluncovered head and a parasol where he stood as to take with himsome larger step altogether the larger step had been since theevening before intensely in his own mind though he had notfully thought out even yet the slightly difficult detail of it but he had had no chance such as he needed to speak thedefinite word to her and the face she now showed affected him accordingly as a notice that she had wonderfully guessed it forherself they had these identities of impulse they had had themrepeatedly before and if such unarranged but unerring encountersgave the measure of the degree in which people were in thecommon phrase meant for each other no union in the world hadever been more sweetened with rightness what in fact most oftenhappened was that her rightness went as who should say evenfurther than his own they were conscious of the same necessityat the same moment only it was she as a general thing who mostclearly saw her way to it something in her long look at him nowout of the old grey window something in the very poise of herhat the colour of her necktie the prolonged stillness of hersmile touched into sudden light for him all the wealth of thefact that he could count on her he had his hand there to pluckit on the open bloom of the day but what did the bright minutemean but that her answering hand was already intelligently out so therefore while the minute lasted it passed between themthat their cup was full which cup their very eyes holding itfast carried and steadied and began as they tasted it topraise he broke however after a moment the silence it only wants a moon a mandolin and a little danger to be aserenade ah then she lightly called down let it at least have this with which she detached a rich white rosebud from its companywith another in the front of her dress and flung it down to him he caught it in its fall fixing her again after she had watchedhim place it in his buttonhole come down quickly he said inan italian not loud but deep vengo vengo she as clearly but more lightly tossed out andshe had left him the next minute to wait for her he came along the terrace again with pauses during which hiseyes rested as they had already often done on the brave darkerwash of far away watercolour that represented the most distant ofthe cathedral towns this place with its great church and itshigh accessibility its towers that distinguishably signalled its english history its appealing type its acknowledgedinterest this place had sounded its name to him half the nightthrough and its name had become but another name thepronounceable and convenient one for that supreme sense ofthings which now throbbed within him he had kept saying tohimself gloucester gloucester gloucester quite as if thesharpest meaning of all the years just passed were intenselyexpressed in it that meaning was really that his situationremained quite sublimely consistent with itself and that theyabsolutely he and charlotte stood there together in the verylustre of this truth every present circumstance helped toproclaim it it was blown into their faces as by the lips of themorning he knew why from the first of his marriage he hadtried with such patience for such conformity he knew why he hadgiven up so much and bored himself so much he knew why he atany rate had gone in on the basis of all forms on the basis ofhis having in a manner sold himself for a situation nette ithad all been just in order that his well what on earth shouldhe call it but his freedom should at present be as perfect androunded and lustrous as some huge precious pearl he hadn tstruggled nor snatched he was taking but what had been givenhim the pearl dropped itself with its exquisite quality andrarity straight into his hand here precisely it was incarnate its size and its value grew as mrs verver appeared afar off in one of the smaller doorways she came toward him insilence while he moved to meet her the great scale of thisparticular front at matcham multiplied thus in the goldenmorning the stages of their meeting and the successions of theirconsciousness it wasn t till she had come quite close that heproduced for her his gloucester gloucester gloucester and his look at it over there she knew just where to look yes isn t it one of the best there are cloisters or towers or some thing and her eyes which though her lips smiled were almost grave with theirdepths of acceptance came back to him or the tomb of some oldking we must see the old king we must do the cathedral he said we must know all about it if we could but take he exhaled the full opportunity and then while for all they seemed togive him he sounded again her eyes i feel the day like a greatgold cup that we must somehow drain together i feel it as you always make me feel everything just as youdo so that i know ten miles off how you feel but do youremember she asked apropos of great gold cups the beautifulone the real one that i offered you so long ago and that youwouldn t have just before your marriage she brought it back tohim the gilded crystal bowl in the little bloomsbury shop oh yes but it took with a slight surprise on the prince spart some small recollecting the treacherous cracked thing youwanted to palm off on me and the little swindling jew whounderstood italian and who backed you up but i feel this anoccasion he immediately added and i hope you don t mean hesmiled that as an occasion it s also cracked they spoke naturally more low than loud overlooked as theywere though at a respectful distance by tiers of windows butit made each find in the other s voice a taste as of somethingslowly and deeply absorbed don t you think too much of cracks and aren t you too afraid of them i risk the cracks said charlotte and i ve often recalled the bowl and the littleswindling jew wondering if they ve parted company he made shesaid a great impression on me well you also no doubt made a great impression on him and idare say that if you were to go back to him you d find he hasbeen keeping that treasure for you but as to cracks the princewent on what did you tell me the other day you prettily callthem in english rifts within the lute risk them as much asyou like for yourself but don t risk them for me he spoke itin all the gaiety of his just barely tremulous serenity i go as you know by my superstitions and that s why he said iknow where we are they re every one to day on our side resting on the parapet toward the great view she was silent alittle and he saw the next moment that her eyes were closed igo but by one thing her hand was on the sun warmed stone sothat turned as they were away from the house he put hisown upon it and covered it i go by you she said i go byyou so they remained a moment till he spoke again with a gesturethat matched what is really our great necessity you know isto go by my watch it s already eleven he had looked at thetime so that if we stop here to luncheon what becomes of ourafternoon to this charlotte s eyes opened straight there s not theslightest need of our stopping here to luncheon don t you see she asked how i m ready he had taken it in but there wasalways more and more of her you mean you ve arranged it s easy to arrange my maid goes up with my things you veonly to speak to your man about yours and they can go together you mean we can leave at once she let him have it all one of the carriages about which ispoke will already have come back for us if your superstitionsare on our side she smiled so my arrangements are and i llback my support against yours then you had thought he wondered about gloucester she hesitated but it was only her way i thought you wouldthink we have thank goodness these harmonies they are foodfor superstition if you like it s beautiful she went on thatit should be gloucester glo ster glo ster as you say makingit sound like an old song however i m sure glo ster glo sterwill be charming she still added we shall be able easily tolunch there and with our luggage and our servants off ourhands we shall have at least three or four hours we can wire she wound up from there ever so quietly she had brought it as she had thought it allout and it had to be as covertly that he let his appreciationexpand then lady castledean doesn t dream of our staying he took it but thinking yet then what does she dream of mr blint poor dear of mr blint only her smile for him for the prince himself was free have i positively to tell youthat she doesn t want us she only wanted us for the others toshow she wasn t left alone with him now that that s done andthat they ve all gone she of course knows for herself knows the prince vaguely echoed why that we like cathedrals that we inevitably stop to seethem or go round to take them in whenever we ve a chance thatit s what our respective families quite expect of us and would bedisappointed for us to fail of this as forestieri mrs ververpursued would be our pull if our pull weren t indeed so greatall round he could only keep his eyes on her and have you made out thevery train the very one paddington the in that gives us oceans we can dine at the usual hour at home and as maggie will ofcourse be in eaton square i hereby invite you for a while he still but looked at her it was a minute before hespoke thank you very much with pleasure to which he in amoment added but the train for gloucester a local one with several stops but doing it a gooddeal i forget how much within the hour so that we ve time only she said we must employ our time he roused himself as from the mere momentary spell of her helooked again at his watch while they moved back to the doorthrough which she had advanced but he had also again questionsand stops all as for the mystery and the charm you looked itup without my having asked you ah my dear she laughed i ve seen you with bradshaw ittakes anglo saxon blood blood he echoed you ve that of every race it kept herbefore him you re terrible well he could put it as he liked i know the name of the inn what is it then there are two you ll see but i ve chosen the right one and ithink i remember the tomb she smiled oh the tomb any tomb would do for him but i mean i hadbeen keeping my idea so cleverly for you while there you alreadywere with it you had been keeping it for me as much as you like but how doyou make out she asked that you were keeping it from me i don t now how shall i ever keep anything some day when ishall wish to ah for things i mayn t want to know i promise you shall findme stupid they had reached their door where she herself pausedto explain these days yesterday last night this morning i ve wanted everything well it was all right you shall have everything xxiiifanny on her arrival in town carried out her second idea despatching the colonel to his club for luncheon and packing hermaid into a cab for cadogan place with the variety of theireffects the result of this for each of the pair was a state ofoccupation so unbroken that the day practically passed withoutfresh contact between them they dined out together but it wasboth in going to their dinner and in coming back that theyappeared on either side to have least to communicate fanny waswrapped in her thoughts still more closely than in the lemon coloured mantle that protected her bare shoulders and herhusband with her silence to deal with showed himself not lessdisposed than usual when so challenged to hold up as he wouldhave said his end of it they had in general in these days longer pauses and more abrupt transitions in one of which latterthey found themselves for a climax launched at midnight mrs assingham rather wearily housed again ascended to the firstfloor there to sink overburdened on the landing outside thedrawing room into a great gilded venetian chair of which atfirst however she but made with her brooding face a sort ofthrone of meditation she would thus have recalled a little withher so free orientalism of type the immemorially speechlesssphinx about at last to become articulate the colonel notunlike on his side some old pilgrim of the desert camping atthe foot of that monument went by way of reconnoissance intothe drawing room he visited according to his wont the windowsand their fastenings he cast round the place the eye all atonce of the master and the manager the commandant and therate payer then he came back to his wife before whom for amoment he stood waiting but she herself for a time continuedto wait only looking up at him inscrutably there was in theseminor manoeuvres and conscious patiences something of asuspension of their old custom of divergent discussion thatintercourse by misunderstanding which had grown so clumsy now this familiar pleasantry seemed to desire to show it could yield on occasion to any clear trouble though it was also sensibly and just incoherently in the air that no trouble was at presentto be vulgarly recognised as clear there might for that matter even have been in mr assingham sface a mild perception of some finer sense a sense for hiswife s situation and the very situation she was oddly enough about to repudiate that she had fairly caused to grow in him but it was a flower to breathe upon gently and this was verymuch what she finally did she knew he needed no telling that shehad given herself all the afternoon to her friends in eatonsquare and that her doing so would have been but the promptresult of impressions gathered in quantities in brimmingbaskets like the purple grapes of the vintage at matcham aprocess surrounded by him while it so unmistakably went on withabstentions and discretions that might almost have counted assolemnities the solemnities at the same time had committed himto nothing to nothing beyond this confession itself of aconsciousness of deep waters she had been out on these waters for him visibly and his tribute to the fact had been hiskeeping her even if without a word well in sight he had notquitted for an hour during her adventure the shore of themystic lake he had on the contrary stationed himself where shecould signal to him at need her need would have arisen if theplanks of her bark had parted then some sort of plunge wouldhave become his immediate duty his present position clearly was that of seeing her in the centre of her sheet of dark water and of wondering if her actual mute gaze at him didn t perhapsmean that her planks were now parting he held himself so readythat it was quite as if the inward man had pulled off coat andwaistcoat before he had plunged however that is before he haduttered a question he perceived not without relief that shewas making for land he watched her steadily paddle always alittle nearer and at last he felt her boat bump the bump wasdistinct and in fact she stepped ashore we were all wrong there s nothing nothing it was like giving her his hand up the bank between charlotte verver and the prince i was uneasy but i msatisfied now i was in fact quite mistaken there s nothing but i thought said bob assingham that that was just what youdid persistently asseverate you ve guaranteed their straightnessfrom the first no i ve never till now guaranteed anything but my owndisposition to worry i ve never till now fanny went on gravelyfrom her chair had such a chance to see and to judge i had itat that place if i had in my infatuation and my folly sheadded with expression nothing else so i did see i have seen and now i know her emphasis as she repeated the word made herhead in her seat of infallibility rise higher i know the colonel took it but took it at first in silence do youmean they ve told you no i mean nothing so absurd for in the first place i haven tasked them and in the second their word in such a matterwouldn t count oh said the colonel with all his oddity they d tell us it made her face him an instant as with her old impatience of hisshort cuts always across her finest flower beds but she felt none the less that she kept her irony down then when they vetold you you ll be perhaps so good as to let me know he jerked up his chin testing the growth of his beard with theback of his hand while he fixed her with a single eye ah idon t say that they d necessarily tell me that they are over thetraces they ll necessarily whatever happens hold their tongues ihope and i m talking of them now as i take them for myself only that s enough for me it s all i have to regard with which after an instant they re wonderful said fanny assingham indeed her husband concurred i really think they are you d think it still more if you knew but you don t know because you don t see their situation this was what he didn tsee is too extraordinary too he was willing to try too extraordinary to be believed i mean if one didn t see butjust that in a way is what saves them they take it seriously he followed at his own pace their situation the incredible side of it they make it credible credible then you do say to you she looked at him again for an interval they believe in itthemselves they take it for what it is and that she said saves them but if what it is is just their chance it s their chance for what i told you when charlotte firstturned up it s their chance for the idea that i was then sureshe had the colonel showed his effort to recall oh your idea atdifferent moments of any one of their ideas this dimprocession visibly mustered before him and with the best willin the world he could but watch its immensity are you speakingnow of something to which you can comfortably settle down again for a little she only glowered at him i ve come backto my belief and that i have done so well he asked as she paused well shows that i m right for i assure you i had wandered far now i m at home again and i mean said fanny assingham tostay here they re beautiful she declared the prince and charlotte the prince and charlotte that s how they re so remarkable andthe beauty she explained is that they re afraid for them afraid i mean for the others for mr verver and maggie it did take some following afraidof what afraid of themselves the colonel wondered of themselves of mr verver s andmaggie s selves mrs assingham remained patient as well as lucid yes of suchblindness too but most of all of their own danger he turned it over that danger being the blindness that danger being their position what their position contains of all the elements i needn t at this time of day attempt totell you it contains luckily for that s the mercy everything but blindness i mean on their part the blindness said fanny is primarily her husband s he stood for a moment he would have it straight whosehusband s mr verver s she went on the blindness is most of all his that they feel that they see but it s also his wife s whose wife s he asked as she continued to gloom at him in amanner at variance with the comparative cheer of her contention and then as she only gloomed the prince s maggie s own maggie s very own she pursued as for herself he had a pause do you think maggie so blind the question isn t of what i think the question s of theconviction that guides the prince and charlotte who have betteropportunities than i for judging the colonel again wondered are you so very sure theiropportunities are better well his wife asked what is their whole so extraordinarysituation their extraordinary relation but an opportunity ah my dear you have that opportunity of their extraordinarysituation and relation as much as they with the difference darling she returned with some spirit that neither of those matters are if you please mine i seethe boat they re in but i m not thank god in it myself to day however mrs assingham added to day in eaton square idid see well then what but she mused over it still oh many things more somehow than ever before it was as if god help me i was seeing forthem i mean for the others it was as if something hadhappened i don t know what except some effect of these dayswith them at that place that had either made things come out orhad cleared my own eyes these eyes indeed of the poor lady srested on her companion s meanwhile with the lustre not so muchof intenser insight as of a particular portent that he had atvarious other times had occasion to recognise she desired obviously to reassure him but it apparently took a couple oflarge candid gathering glittering tears to emphasisethe fact they had immediately for him their usual directaction she must reassure him he was made to feel absolutely inher own way he would adopt it and conform to it as soon as heshould be able to make it out the only thing was that it tooksuch incalculable twists and turns the twist seemed remarkablefor instance as she developed her indication of what had come outin the afternoon it was as if i knew better than ever whatmakes them what makes them he pressed her as she fitfully dropped well makes the prince and charlotte take it all as they do itmight well have been difficult to know how to take it and theymay even say for themselves that they were a long time trying tosee as i say to day she went on it was as if i weresuddenly with a kind of horrible push seeing through theireyes on which as to shake off her perversity fannyassingham sprang up but she remained there under the dimillumination and while the colonel with his high dry sparelook of type to which a certain conformity to the whiteness ofinaccessible snows in his necktie shirt front and waistcoat gavea rigour of accent waited watching her they might at the latehour and in the still house have been a pair of specious worldlyadventurers driven for relief under sudden stress to some grimmidnight reckoning in an odd corner her attention movedmechanically over the objects of ornament disposed too freely onthe walls of staircase and landing as to which recognition forthe time had lost both fondness and compunction i can imaginethe way it works she said it s so easy to understand yet idon t want to be wrong she the next moment broke out i don t i don t want to be wrong to make a mistake you mean oh no she meant nothing of the sort she knew but too well whatshe meant i don t make mistakes but i perpetrate in thought crimes and she spoke with all intensity i m a most dreadfulperson there are times when i seem not to mind a bit what i vedone or what i think or imagine or fear or accept when i feelthat i d do it again feel that i d do things myself ah my dear the colonel remarked in the coolness of debate yes if you had driven me back on my nature luckily for youyou never have you ve done every thing else but you ve neverdone that but what i really don t a bit want she declared isto abet them or to protect them her companion turned this over what is there to protect themfrom if by your now so settled faith they ve done nothingthat justly exposes them and it in fact half pulled her up well from a sudden scare from the alarm i mean of what maggie may think yet if your whole idea is that maggie thinks nothing she waited again it isn t my whole idea nothing is my whole idea for i felt to day as i tell you that there s somuch in the air oh in the air the colonel dryly breathed well what s in the air always has hasn t it to come down tothe earth and maggie mrs assingham continued is a verycurious little person since i was in this afternoon forseeing more than i had ever done well i felt that too for somereason as i hadn t yet felt it for some reason for what reason and then as his wife atfirst said nothing did she give any sign was she in any waydifferent she s always so different from anyone else in the world thatit s hard to say when she s different from herself but she hasmade me said fanny after an instant think of her differently she drove me home home here first to portland place on her leaving her father since shedoes once in a while leave him that was to keep me with her alittle longer but she kept the carriage and after tea there came with me herself back here this was also for the samepurpose then she went home though i had brought her a messagefrom the prince that arranged their movements otherwise he andcharlotte must have arrived if they have arrived expecting todrive together to eaton square and keep maggie on to dinnerthere she has everything there you know she has clothes the colonel didn t in fact know but he gave it his apprehension oh you mean a change twenty changes if you like all sorts of things she dresses really maggie does as much for her father and she always did as for her husband or for herself she has her room in his housevery much as she had it before she was married and just as theboy has quite a second nursery there in which mrs noble whenshe comes with him makes herself i assure you at home si bienthat if charlotte in her own house so to speak should wish afriend or two to stay with her she really would be scarce ableto put them up it was a picture into which as a thrifty entertainer himself bob assingham could more or less enter maggie and the childspread so maggie and the child spread so well he considered it is rather rum that s all i claim she seemed thankful for the word i don tsay it s anything more but it is distinctly rum which after an instant the colonel took up more what morecould it be it could be that she s unhappy and that she takes her funnylittle way of consoling herself for if she were unhappy mrs assingham had figured it out that s just the way i mconvinced she would take but how can she be unhappy since asi m also convinced she in the midst of everything adores herhusband as much as ever the colonel at this brooded for a little at large then if she sso happy please what s the matter it made his wife almost spring at him you think then she ssecretly wretched but he threw up his arms in deprecation ah my dear i givethem up to you i ve nothing more to suggest then it s not sweet of you she spoke at present as if he werefrequently sweet you admit that it is rum and this indeed fixed again for a moment his intention hascharlotte complained of the want of rooms for her friends never that i know of a word it isn t the sort of thing shedoes and whom has she after all mrs assingham added tocomplain to hasn t she always you oh me charlotte and i nowadays she spoke as of achapter closed yet see the justice i still do her she strikesme more and more as extraordinary a deeper shade at the renewal of the word had come into thecolonel s face if they re each and all so extraordinary then isn t that why one must just resign one s self to wash one shands of them to be lost her face however so met thequestion as if it were but a flicker of the old tone that theirtrouble had now become too real for her charged eyes so betrayedthe condition of her nerves that he stepped back alertly enough to firmer ground he had spoken before in this light of a plainman s vision but he must be something more than a plain man now hasn t she then charlotte always her husband to complain to she d rather die oh and bob assingham s face at the vision of suchextremities lengthened for very docility hasn t she the princethen for such matters oh he doesn t count i thought that was just what as the basis of our agitation hedoes do mrs assingham however had her distinction ready not a bit asa person to bore with complaints the ground of my agitation is exactly that she never on any pretext bores him not charlotte and in the imagination of mrs verver s superiority to any suchmistake she gave characteristically something like a toss ofher head as marked a tribute to that lady s general grace inall the conditions as the personage referred to doubtless hadever received ah only maggie with which the colonel gave a short lowgurgle but it found his wife again prepared no not only maggie a great many people in london and smallwonder bore him maggie only worst then but it was a question that he hadpromptly dropped at the returning brush of another of which shehad shortly before sown the seed you said just now that hewould by this time be back with charlotte if they have arrived you think it then possible that they really won t have returned his companion exhibited to view for the idea a sense of herresponsibility but this was insufficient clearly to keep herfrom entertaining it i think there s nothing they re not nowcapable of in their so intense good faith good faith he echoed the words which had in fact somethingof an odd ring critically their false position it comes to the same thing and she boredown with her decision the superficial lack of sequence theymay very possibly for a demonstration as i see them not havecome back he wondered visibly at this how she did see them may havebolted somewhere together may have stayed over at matcham itself till tomorrow may havewired home each of them since maggie left me may have done fanny assingham continued god knows what she went on suddenly with more emotion which at the pressure of somespring of her inner vision broke out in a wail of distress imperfectly smothered whatever they ve done i shall never know never never because i don t want to and because nothing willinduce me so they may do as they like but i ve worked for themall she uttered this last with another irrepressible quaver andthe next moment her tears had come though she had with theexplosion quitted her husband as if to hide it from him shepassed into the dusky drawing room where during his own prowl shortly previous he had drawn up a blind so that the light ofthe street lamps came in a little at the window she made forthis window against which she leaned her head while thecolonel with his lengthened face looked after her for a minuteand hesitated he might have been wondering what she had reallydone to what extent beyond his knowledge or his conception inthe affairs of these people she could have committed herself but to hear her cry and yet try not to was quickly enough toomuch for him he had known her at other times quite not try notto and that had not been so bad he went to her and put his armround her he drew her head to his breast where while shegasped she let it stay a little all with a patience thatpresently stilled her yet the effect of this small crisis oddlyenough was not to close their colloquy with the natural resultof sending them to bed what was between them had opened outfurther had somehow through the sharp show of her feeling taken a positive stride had entered as it were without morewords the region of the understood shutting the door after itand bringing them so still more nearly face to face theyremained for some minutes looking at it through the dim windowwhich opened upon the world of human trouble in general and whichlet the vague light play here and there upon gilt and crystal andcolour the florid features looming dimly of fanny sdrawing room and the beauty of what thus passed between them passed with her cry of pain with her burst of tears with hiswonderment and his kindness and his comfort with the moments oftheir silence above all which might have represented theirsinking together hand in hand for a time into the mystic lakewhere he had begun as we have hinted by seeing her paddlealone the beauty of it was that they now could really talkbetter than before because the basis had at last once for all defined itself what was the basis which fanny absolutelyexacted but that charlotte and the prince must be saved so faras consistently speaking of them as still safe might save them it did save them somehow for fanny s troubled mind for thatwas the nature of the mind of women he conveyed to her now atall events by refusing her no gentleness that he hadsufficiently got the tip and that the tip was all he had wanted this remained quite clear even when he presently reverted to whatshe had told him of her recent passage with maggie i don taltogether see you know what you infer from it or why youinfer anything when he so expressed himself it was quite as ifin possession of what they had brought up from the depths xxiv i can t say more this made his companion reply than thatsomething in her face her voice and her whole manner acted uponme as nothing in her had ever acted before and just for thereason above all that i felt her trying her very best and hervery best poor duck is very good to be quiet and natural it swhen one sees people who always are natural making little pale pathetic blinking efforts for it then it is that one knowssomething s the matter i can t describe my impression you wouldhave had it for yourself and the only thing that ever can be thematter with maggie is that by that i mean her beginning todoubt to doubt for the first time mrs assingham wound up of her wonderful little judgment of her wonderful little world it was impressive fanny s vision and the colonel as if himselfagitated by it took another turn of prowling to doubt offidelity to doubt of friendship poor duck indeed it will gohard with her but she ll put it all he concluded oncharlotte mrs assingham still darkly contemplative denied this with aheadshake she won t put it anywhere she won t do with itanything anyone else would she ll take it all herself you mean she ll make it out her own fault yes she ll find means somehow to arrive at that ah then the colonel dutifully declared she s indeed a littlebrick oh his wife returned you ll see in one way or another towhat tune and she spoke of a sudden with an approach toelation so that as if immediately feeling his surprise sheturned round to him she ll see me somehow through see you yes me i m the worst for said fanny assingham now with aharder exaltation i did it all i recognise that i accept it she won t cast it up at me she won t cast up anything so ithrow myself upon her she ll bear me up she spoke almostvolubly she held him with her sudden sharpness she ll carrythe whole weight of us there was still nevertheless wonder in it you mean she won tmind i say love and he not unkindly stared then where sthe difficulty there isn t any fanny declared with the same rich emphasis it kept him indeed as by the loss of the thread looking at herlonger ah you mean there isn t any for us she met his look for a minute as if it perhaps a little too muchimputed a selfishness a concern at any cost for their ownsurface then she might have been deciding that their own surfacewas after all what they had most to consider not she saidwith dignity if we properly keep our heads she appeared evento signify that they would begin by keeping them now this waswhat it was to have at last a constituted basis do you rememberwhat you said to me that night of my first real anxiety afterthe foreign office party in the carriage as we came home yes he could recall it leave them to pull through precisely trust their own wit you practically said to saveall appearances well i ve trusted it i have left them to pullthrough he hesitated and your point is that they re not doing so i ve left them she went on but now i see how and where i vebeen leaving them all the while without knowing it to her to the princess and that s what i mean mrs assingham pensively pursued that s what happened to me with her to day she continued toexplain it came home to me that that s what i ve really beendoing oh i see i needn t torment myself she has taken them over the colonel declared that he saw yet it was as if at this hea little sightlessly stared but what then has happened fromone day to the other to her what has opened her eyes they were never really shut she misses him then why hasn t she missed him before well facing him there among their domestic glooms and glints fanny worked it out she did but she wouldn t let herself knowit she had her reason she wore her blind now at last hersituation has come to a head to day she does know it and that silluminating it has been mrs assingham wound up illuminating to me her husband attended but the momentary effect of his attentionwas vagueness again and the refuge of his vagueness was a gasp poor dear little girl ah no don t pity her this did however pull him up we mayn t even be sorry forher not now or at least not yet it s too soon that is if it isn tvery much too late this will depend mrs assingham went on at any rate we shall see we might have pitied her before forall the good it would then have done her we might have begunsome time ago now however she has begun to live and the wayit comes to me the way it comes to me but again she projectedher vision the way it comes to you can scarcely be that she ll like it the way it comes to me is that she will live the way it comesto me is that she ll triumph she said this with so sudden a prophetic flare that it fairlycheered her husband ah then we must back her no we mustn t touch her we mayn t touch any of them we mustkeep our hands off we must go on tiptoe we must simply watchand wait and meanwhile said mrs assingham we must bear itas we can that s where we are and serves us right we re inpresence and so moving about the room as in communion with shadowyportents she left it till he questioned again in presence ofwhat well of something possibly beautiful beautiful as it may comeoff she had paused there before him while he wondered you meanshe ll get the prince back she raised her hand in quick impatience the suggestion mighthave been almost abject it isn t a question of recovery itwon t be a question of any vulgar struggle to get him back shemust have lost him and to have lost him she must have had him with which fanny shook her head what i take her to be wakingup to is the truth that all the while she really hasn t hadhim never ah my dear the poor colonel panted never his wife repeated and she went on without pity do youremember what i said to you long ago that evening just beforetheir marriage when charlotte had so suddenly turned up the smile with which he met this appeal was not it was to befeared robust what haven t you love said in your time so many things no doubt that they make a chance for my havingonce or twice spoken the truth i never spoke it more at allevents than when i put it to you that evening that maggie wasthe person in the world to whom a wrong thing could least becommunicated it was as if her imagination had been closed to it her sense altogether sealed that therefore fanny continued is what will now have to happen her sense will have to open i see he nodded to the wrong he nodded again almostcheerfully as if he had been keeping the peace with a baby or alunatic to the very very wrong but his wife s spirit after its effort of wing was able toremain higher to what s called evil with a very big e for thefirst time in her life to the discovery of it to the knowledgeof it to the crude experience of it and she gave for thepossibility the largest measure to the harsh bewilderingbrush the daily chilling breath of it unless indeed and heremrs assingham noted a limit unless indeed as yet so far asshe has come and if she comes no further simply to thesuspicion and the dread what we shall see is whether that meredose of alarm will prove enough he considered but enough for what then dear if not enough tobreak her heart enough to give her a shaking mrs assingham rather oddlyreplied to give her i mean the right one the right one won tbreak her heart it will make her she explained well it willmake her by way of a change understand one or two things in theworld but isn t it a pity the colonel asked that they shouldhappen to be the one or two that will be the most disagreeable toher oh disagreeable they ll have had to be disagreeable toshow her a little where she is they ll have had to bedisagreeable to make her sit up they ll have had to bedisagreeable to make her decide to live bob assingham was now at the window while his companion slowlyrevolved he had lighted a cigarette for final patience and heseemed vaguely to time her as she moved to and fro he had atthe same time to do justice to the lucidity she had at lastattained and it was doubtless by way of expression of thisteachability that he let his eyes for a minute roll as fromthe force of feeling over the upper dusk of the room he hadthought of the response his wife s words ideally implied decide to live ah yes for her child oh bother her child and he had never felt so snubbed for anexemplary view as when fanny now stopped short to live youpoor dear for her father which is another pair of sleeves and mrs assingham s whole ample ornamented person irradiated with this the truth that had begun under so much handling toglow any idiot can do things for her child she ll have amotive more original and we shall see how it will work her she ll have to save him to save him to keep her father from her own knowledge that and she seemedto see it before her in her husband s very eyes will be workcut out with which as at the highest conceivable climax shewound up their colloquy good night there was something in her manner however or in the effect atleast of this supreme demonstration that had fairly and by asingle touch lifted him to her side so that after she hadturned her back to regain the landing and the staircase heovertook her before she had begun to mount with the ring ofexcited perception ah but you know that s rather jolly jolly she turned upon it again at the foot of thestaircase i mean it s rather charming charming it had still to be their law a little that shewas tragic when he was comic i mean it s rather beautiful you just said yourself it wouldbe only he pursued promptly with the impetus of this idea and as if it had suddenly touched with light for him connectionshitherto dim only i don t quite see why that very care for himwhich has carried her to such other lengths precisely as affectone as so rum hasn t also by the same stroke made her noticea little more what has been going on ah there you are it s the question that i ve all along beenasking myself she had rested her eyes on the carpet but sheraised them as she pursued she let him have it straight andit s the question of an idiot an idiot well the idiot that i ve been in all sorts of ways so often of late have i asked it you re excusable since you ask it butnow the answer i saw to day has all the while been staring mein the face then what in the world is it why the very intensity of her conscience about him the verypassion of her brave little piety that s the way it has worked mrs assingham explained and i admit it to have been as rum away as possible but it has been working from a rum start fromthe moment the dear man married to ease his daughter off and itthen happened by an extraordinary perversity that the veryopposite effect was produced with the renewed vision of thisfatality however she could give but a desperate shrug i see the colonel sympathetically mused that was a rumstart but his very response as she again flung up her arms seemed tomake her sense for a moment intolerable yes there i am iwas really at the bottom of it she declared i don t know whatpossessed me but i planned for him i goaded him on withwhich however the next moment she took herself up or rather i do know what possessed me for wasn t he beset withravening women right and left and didn t he quitepathetically appeal for protection didn t he quite charmingly show one how he needed and desired it maggie she thus lucidlycontinued couldn t with a new life of her own give herself upto doing for him in the future all she had done in the past tofencing him in to keeping him safe and keeping them off oneperceived this she went on out of the abundance of one saffection and one s sympathy it all blessedly came back toher when it wasn t all for the fiftieth time obscured in faceof the present facts by anxiety and compunction one was nodoubt a meddlesome fool one always is to think one seespeople s lives for them better than they see them for themselves but one s excuse here she insisted was that these peopleclearly didn t see them for themselves didn t see them at all it struck one for very pity that they were making a mess of suchcharming material that they were but wasting it and letting itgo they didn t know how to live and somehow one couldn t ifone took an interest in them at all simply stand and see it that s what i pay for and the poor woman in straightercommunion with her companion s intelligence at this moment sheappeared to feel than she had ever been before let him have thewhole of the burden of her consciousness i always pay for it sooner or later my sociable my damnable my unnecessaryinterest nothing of course would suit me but that it should fixitself also on charlotte charlotte who was hovering there on theedge of our lives when not beautifully and a triflemysteriously flitting across them and who was a piece of wasteand a piece of threatened failure just as for any possible goodto the world mr verver and maggie were it began to come overme in the watches of the night that charlotte was a person whocould keep off ravening women without being one herself either in the vulgar way of the others and that this service to mr verver would be a sweet employment for her future there wassomething of course that might have stopped me you know youknow what i mean it looks at me she veritably moaned out ofyour face but all i can say is that it didn t the reasonlargely being once i had fallen in love with the beautifulsymmetry of my plan that i seemed to feel sure maggie wouldaccept charlotte whereas i didn t quite make out either whatother woman or what other kind of woman one could think of heraccepting i see i see she had paused meeting all the while hislistening look and the fever of her retrospect had so risen withher talk that the desire was visibly strong in him to meet her on his side but with cooling breath one quite understands mydear it only however kept her there sombre i naturally see love what you understand which sits again perfectly in your eyes you see that i saw that maggie would accept her in helplessignorance yes dearest and the grimness of her drearinesssuddenly once more possessed her you ve only to tell me thatthat knowledge was my reason for what i did how when you do can i stand up to you you see she said with an ineffableheadshake that i don t stand up i m down down down shedeclared yet she as quickly added there s just one littlething that helps to save my life and she kept him waiting butan instant they might easily they would perhaps evencertainly have done something worse he thought worse than that charlotte ah don t tell me she cried that there could have beennothing worse there might as they were have been many things charlotte in her way is extraordinary he was almost simultaneous extraordinary she observes the forms said fanny assingham he hesitated with the prince for the prince and with the others she went on with mr verver wonderfully but above all with maggie and the forms she had to do even them justice are two thirds of conduct say he had married a woman who would have made a hash of them but he jerked back ah my dear i wouldn t say it for theworld say she none the less pursued he had married a woman theprince would really have cared for you mean then he doesn t care for charlotte this was still anew view to jump to and the colonel perceptibly wished to makesure of the necessity of the effort for that while he stared his wife allowed him time at the end of which she simply said no then what on earth are they up to still however she onlylooked at him so that standing there before her with his handsin his pockets he had time further to risk soothingly another question are the forms you speak of that aretwo thirds of conduct what will be keeping her now by yourhypothesis from coming home with him till morning yes absolutely their forms theirs maggie s and mr verver s those they impose on charlotte andthe prince those she developed that so perversely as isay have succeeded in setting themselves up as the right ones he considered but only now at last really to relapse into woe your perversity my dear is exactly what i don t understand the state of things existing hasn t grown like a field ofmushrooms in a night whatever they all round may be in fornow is at least the consequence of what they ve done are theymere helpless victims of fate well fanny at last had the courage of it yes they are to beso abjectly innocent that is to be victims of fate and charlotte and the prince are abjectly innocent it took her another minute but she rose to the full height yes that is they were as much so in their way as the others there were beautiful intentions all round the prince s andcharlotte s were beautiful of that i had my faith they were i d go to the stake otherwise she added i should have been awretch and i ve not been a wretch i ve only been a double dyeddonkey ah then he asked what does our muddle make them to havebeen well too much taken up with considering each other you maycall such a mistake as that by what ever name you please it atany rate means all round their case it illustrates themisfortune said mrs assingham gravely of being too toocharming this was another matter that took some following but the colonelagain did his best yes but to whom doesn t it rather dependon that to whom have the prince and charlotte then been toocharming to each other in the first place obviously and then both ofthem together to maggie to maggie he wonderingly echoed to maggie she was now crystalline by having accepted fromthe first so guilelessly yes so guilelessly themselves herguileless idea of still having her father of keeping him fast in her life then isn t one supposed in common humanity and if one hasn tquarrelled with him and one has the means and he on his side doesn t drink or kick up rows isn t one supposed to keep one saged parent in one s life certainly when there aren t particular reasons against it thatthere may be others than his getting drunk is exactly the moralof what is before us in the first place mr verver isn t aged the colonel just hung fire but it came then why the deuce doeshe oh poor dear man behave as if he were she took a moment to meet it how do you know how he behaves well my own love we see how charlotte does again at this she faltered but again she rose ah isn t my whole point thathe s charming to her doesn t it depend a bit on what she regards as charming she faced the question as if it were flippant then with aheadshake of dignity she brushed it away it s mr verver who sreally young it s charlotte who s really old and what i wassaying she added isn t affected you were saying he did her the justice that they re allguileless that they were guileless all at first quite extraordinarily it s what i mean by their failure to see that the more they tookfor granted they could work together the more they were reallyworking apart for i repeat fanny went on that i reallybelieve charlotte and the prince honestly to have made up theirminds originally that their very esteem for mr verver whichwas serious as well it might be would save them i see the colonel inclined himself and save him it comes to the same thing then save maggie that comes said mrs assingham to something a littledifferent for maggie has done the most he wondered what do you call the most well she did it originally she began the vicious circle forthat though you make round eyes at my associating her with vice is simply what it has been it s their mutualconsideration all round that has made it the bottomless gulf and they re really so embroiled but because in their way they ve been so improbably good in their way yes the colonel grinned which was above all maggie s way no flicker of his ribaldrywas anything to her now maggie had in the first place to makeup to her father for her having suffered herself to become poorlittle dear as she believed so intensely married then she hadto make up to her husband for taking so much of the time theymight otherwise have spent together to make this reparation tomr verver perfect and her way to do this precisely was byallowing the prince the use the enjoyment whatever you may callit of charlotte to cheer his path by instalments as it were in proportion as she herself making sure her father was allright might be missed from his side by so much at the sametime however mrs assingham further explained by so much asshe took her young stepmother for this purpose away from mr verver by just so much did this too strike her as somethingagain to be made up for it has saddled her you will easily see with a positively new obligation to her father an obligationcreated and aggravated by her unfortunate even if quite heroic little sense of justice she began with wanting to show him thathis marriage could never under whatever temptation of her ownbliss with the prince become for her a pretext for deserting orneglecting him then that in its order entailed her wanting toshow the prince that she recognised how the other desire thiswish to remain intensely the same passionate little daughtershe had always been involved in some degree and just for thepresent so to speak her neglecting and deserting him i quitehold fanny with characteristic amplitude parenthesised that aperson can mostly feel but one passion one tender passion thatis at a time only that doesn t hold good for our primary andinstinctive attachments the voice of blood such as one sfeeling for a parent or a brother those may be intense andyet not prevent other intensities as you will recognise mydear when you remember how i continued tout betement to adoremy mother whom you didn t adore for years after i had begun toadore you well maggie she kept it up is in the samesituation as i was plus complications from which i was thankheaven exempt plus the complication above all of not havingin the least begun with the sense for complications that i shouldhave had before she knew it at any rate her little scruplesand her little lucidities which were really so divinely blind her feverish little sense of justice as i say had brought thetwo others together as her grossest misconduct couldn t havedone and now she knows something or other has happened yethasn t heretofore known what she has only piled up her remedy poor child something that she has earnestly but confusedly seenas her necessary policy piled it on top of the policy on top ofthe remedy that she at first thought out for herself and thatwould really have needed since then so much modification heronly modification has been the growth of her necessity to preventher father s wondering if all in their life in common may be socertainly for the best she has now as never before to keep himunconscious that peculiar if he makes a point of it as theirsituation is there s anything in it all uncomfortable ordisagreeable anything morally the least out of the way she hasto keep touching it up to make it each day each month looknatural and normal to him so that god forgive me thecomparison she s like an old woman who has taken to painting and who has to lay it on thicker to carry it off with a greateraudacity with a greater impudence even the older she grows and fanny stood a moment captivated with the image she had thrownoff i like the idea of maggie audacious and impudent learningto be so to gloss things over she could she even will yet ibelieve learn it for that sacred purpose consummately diabolically for from the moment the dear man should see it sall rouge she paused staring at the vision it imparted itself even to bob then the fun would begin as itbut made her look at him hard however he amended the form ofhis inquiry you mean that in that case she will charmingcreature be lost she was silent a moment more as i ve told you before she won tbe lost if her father s saved she ll see that as salvationenough the colonel took it in then she s a little heroine rather she s a little heroine but it s his innocence aboveall mrs assingham added that will pull them through her companion at this focussed again mr verver s innocence it s awfully quaint of course it s awfully quaint that it s awfully quaint thatthe pair are awfully quaint quaint with all our dear oldquaintness by which i don t mean yours and mine but that of myown sweet countrypeople from whom i ve so deplorablydegenerated that mrs assingham declared was originally thehead and front of their appeal to me and of my interest inthem and of course i shall feel them quainter still she ratherruefully subjoined before they ve done with me this might be but it wasn t what most stood in the colonel sway you believe so in mr verver s innocence after two years ofcharlotte she stared but the whole point is just that two years ofcharlotte are what he hasn t really or what you may callundividedly had any more than maggie by your theory eh has really orundividedly had four of the prince it takes all she hasn thad the colonel conceded to account for the innocence that inher too so leaves us in admiration so far as it might be ribald again she let this pass it takes agreat many things to account for maggie what is definite at allevents is that strange though this be her effort for herfather has up to now sufficiently succeeded she has made him she makes him accept the tolerably obvious oddity of theirrelation all round for part of the game behind her there protected and amused and as it were exquisitely humbugged theprincipino in whom he delights always aiding he has safely andserenely enough suffered the conditions of his life to pass forthose he had sublimely projected he hadn t worked them out indetail any more than i had heaven pity me and the queernesshas been exactly in the detail this for him is what it wasto have married charlotte and they both she neatly wound up help both i mean that if maggie always in the breach makes it seem tohim all so flourishingly to fit charlotte does her part notless and her part is very large charlotte fanny declared works like a horse so there it all was and her husband looked at her a minuteacross it and what does the prince work like she fixed him in return like a prince whereupon breakingshort off to ascend to her room she presented her highly decorated back in which in odd places controlling thecomplications of its aspect the ruby or the garnet theturquoise and the topaz gleamed like faint symbols of the witthat pinned together the satin patches of her argument he watched her as if she left him positively under the impressionof her mastery of her subject yes as if the real upshot of thedrama before them was but that he had when it came to the tightplaces of life as life had shrunk for him now the most luminousof wives he turned off in this view of her majestic retreat the comparatively faint little electric lamp which had presidedover their talk then he went up as immediately behind her as thebillows of her amber train allowed making out how all theclearness they had conquered was even for herself a relief howat last the sense of the amplitude of her exposition sustainedand floated her joining her however on the landing above where she had already touched a metallic point into light hefound she had done perhaps even more to create than to extinguishin him the germ of a curiosity he held her a minute longer there was another plum in the pie what did you mean someminutes ago by his not caring for charlotte the prince s by his not really caring she recalled after alittle benevolently enough i mean that men don t when it hasall been too easy that s how in nine cases out of ten a womanis treated who has risked her life you asked me just now how heworks she added but you might better perhaps have asked mehow he plays well he made it up like a prince like a prince he is profoundly a prince for that she saidwith expression he s beautifully a case they re far rarer even in the highest circles than they pretend to be andthat s what makes so much of his value he s perhaps one of thevery last the last of the real ones so it is we must take him we must take him all round the colonel considered and how must charlotte if anythinghappens take him the question held her a minute and while she waited with hereyes on him she put out a grasping hand to his arm in the fleshof which he felt her answer distinctly enough registered thusshe gave him standing off a little the firmest longest deepest injunction he had ever received from her nothing in spite of everything will happen nothing has happened nothing is happening he looked a trifle disappointed i see for us for us for whom else and he was to feel indeed how she wishedhim to understand it we know nothing on earth it was anundertaking he must sign so he wrote as it were his name we know nothing on earth itwas like the soldiers watchword at night we re as innocent she went on in the same way as babes why not rather say he asked as innocent as they themselvesare oh for the best of reasons because we re much more so he wondered but how can we be more for them oh easily we can be anything absolute idiots then absolute idiots and oh fanny breathed the way it will restus well he looked as if there were something in that but won tthey know we re not she barely hesitated charlotte and the prince think we are which is so much gained mr verver believes in ourintelligence but he doesn t matter and maggie doesn t she know that we see before our noses yes this indeed took longer oh so far as she may guess it she ll give no sign so it comesto the same thing he raised his eyebrows comes to our not being able to helpher that s the way we shall help her by looking like fools she threw up her hands she only wants herself to look like abigger so there we are with which she brushed it away hisconformity was promised something however still held her itbroke to her own vision as a last wave of clearness moreover now she said i see i mean she added what youwere asking me how i knew to day in eaton square that maggie sawake and she had indeed visibly got it it was by seeing themtogether seeing her with her father he fell behind again but you veseen her often enough before never with my present eyes for nothing like such a test thatof this length of the others absence together has hithertooccurred possibly but if she and mr verver insisted upon it why is it such a test because it has become one without theirintending it it has spoiled so to speak on their hands it has soured eh the colonel said the word s horrible say rather it has changed perhaps fanny went on she did wish to see how much she can bear inthat case she has seen only it was she alone who about thevisit insisted her father insists on nothing and she watcheshim do it her husband looked impressed watches him for the first faint sign i mean of his noticing it doesn t asi tell you come but she s there for it to see and i felt shecontinued how she s there i caught her as it were in thefact she couldn t keep it from me though she left her post onpurpose came home with me to throw dust in my eyes i took itall her dust but it was what showed me with which supremelucidity she reached the door of her room luckily it showed mealso how she has succeeded nothing from him has come you re so awfully sure sure nothing will good night she said she ll die first the golden bowl volume iibook second the princesspart fourthxxvit was not till many days had passed that the princess began toaccept the idea of having done a little something she was notalways doing or indeed that of having listened to any inwardvoice that spoke in a new tone yet these instinctivepostponements of reflection were the fruit positively ofrecognitions and perceptions already active of the sense aboveall that she had made at a particular hour made by the meretouch of her hand a difference in the situation so long presentto her as practically unattackable this situation had beenoccupying for months and months the very centre of the gardenof her life but it had reared itself there like some strange tall tower of ivory or perhaps rather some wonderful beautiful but outlandish pagoda a structure plated with hard brightporcelain coloured and figured and adorned at the overhangingeaves with silver bells that tinkled ever so charmingly whenstirred by chance airs she had walked round and round it thatwas what she felt she had carried on her existence in the spaceleft her for circulation a space that sometimes seemed ample andsometimes narrow looking up all the while at the fairstructure that spread itself so amply and rose so high but neverquite making out as yet where she might have entered had shewished she had not wished till now such was the odd case andwhat was doubtless equally odd besides was that though herraised eyes seemed to distinguish places that must serve fromwithin and especially far aloft as apertures and outlooks nodoor appeared to give access from her convenient garden level the great decorated surface had remained consistentlyimpenetrable and inscrutable at present however to herconsidering mind it was as if she had ceased merely to circleand to scan the elevation ceased so vaguely so quite helplesslyto stare and wonder she had caught herself distinctly in the actof pausing then in that of lingering and finally in that ofstepping unprecedentedly near the thing might have been by thedistance at which it kept her a mahometan mosque with which nobase heretic could take a liberty there so hung about it thevision of one s putting off one s shoes to enter and even verily of one s paying with one s life if found there as aninterloper she had not certainly arrived at the conception ofpaying with her life for anything she might do but it wasnevertheless quite as if she had sounded with a tap or two one ofthe rare porcelain plates she had knocked in short though shecould scarce have said whether for admission or for what she hadapplied her hand to a cool smooth spot and had waited to see whatwould happen something had happened it was as if a sound ather touch after a little had come back to her from within asound sufficiently suggesting that her approach had been noted if this image however may represent our young woman sconsciousness of a recent change in her life a change now but afew days old it must at the same time be observed that she bothsought and found in renewed circulation as i have called it ameasure of relief from the idea of having perhaps to answer forwhat she had done the pagoda in her blooming garden figured thearrangement how otherwise was it to be named by which sostrikingly she had been able to marry without breaking as sheliked to put it with the past she had surrendered herself toher husband without the shadow of a reserve or a condition andyet she had not all the while given up her father the leastlittle inch she had compassed the high city of seeing the twomen beautifully take to each other and nothing in her marriagehad marked it as more happy than this fact of its havingpractically given the elder the lonelier a new friend what hadmoreover all the while enriched the whole aspect of success wasthat the latter s marriage had been no more meassurably paid forthan her own his having taken the same great step in the samefree way had not in the least involved the relegation of hisdaughter that it was remarkable they should have been able atonce so to separate and so to keep together had never for amoment from however far back been equivocal to her that it wasremarkable had in fact quite counted at first and always andfor each of them equally as part of their inspiration and theirsupport there were plenty of singular things they were notenamoured of flights of brilliancy of audacity of originality that speaking at least for the dear man and herself were not atall in their line but they liked to think they had given theirlife this unusual extension and this liberal form which manyfamilies many couples and still more many pairs of couples would not have found workable that last truth had beendistinctly brought home to them by the bright testimony thequite explicit envy of most of their friends who had remarkedto them again and again that they must on all the showing tokeep on such terms be people of the highest amiability equallyincluding in the praise of course amerigo and charlotte it hadgiven them pleasure as how should it not to find themselvesshed such a glamour it had certainly that is given pleasure toher father and herself both of them distinguishably of a natureso slow to presume that they would scarce have been sure of theirtriumph without this pretty reflection of it so it was thattheir felicity had fructified so it was that the ivory tower visible and admirable doubtless from any point of the socialfield had risen stage by stage maggie s actual reluctance toask herself with proportionate sharpness why she had ceased totake comfort in the sight of it represented accordingly a lapsefrom that ideal consistency on which her moral comfort almost atany time depended to remain consistent she had always beencapable of cutting down more or less her prior term moving for the first time in her life as in the darkening shadowof a false position she reflected that she should either nothave ceased to be right that is to be confident or haverecognised that she was wrong though she tried to deal withherself for a space only as a silken coated spaniel who hasscrambled out of a pond and who rattles the water from his ears her shake of her head again and again as she went was much ofthat order and she had the resource to which save for the rudeequivalent of his generalising bark the spaniel would have beena stranger of humming to herself hard as a sign that nothing hadhappened to her she had not so to speak fallen in she had hadno accident and had not got wet this at any rate was herpretension until after she began a little to wonder if shemightn t with or without exposure have taken cold she could atall events remember no time at which she had felt so excited andcertainly none which was another special point that so broughtwith it as well the necessity for concealing excitement thisbirth of a new eagerness became a high pastime in her view precisely by reason of the ingenuity required for keeping thething born out of sight the ingenuity was thus a private andabsorbing exercise in the light of which might i so farmultiply my metaphors i should compare her to the frightened butclinging young mother of an unlawful child the idea that hadpossession of her would be by our new analogy the proof of hermisadventure but likewise all the while only another sign of arelation that was more to her than anything on earth she hadlived long enough to make out for herself that any deep seatedpassion has its pangs as well as its joys and that we are madeby its aches and its anxieties most richly conscious of it shehad never doubted of the force of the feeling that bound her toher husband but to become aware almost suddenly that it hadbegun to vibrate with a violence that had some of the effect of astrain would rightly looked at after all but show that she was like thousands of women every day acting up to the fullprivilege of passion why in the world shouldn t she with everyright if on consideration she saw no good reason against it the best reason against it would have been the possibility ofsome consequence disagreeable or inconvenient to others especially to such others as had never incommoded her by theegotism of their passions but if once that danger were dulyguarded against the fulness of one s measure amounted to no morethan the equal use of one s faculties or the proper playing ofone s part it had come to the princess obscurely at first butlittle by little more conceivably that her faculties had not fora good while been concomitantly used the case resembled in amanner that of her once loved dancing a matter of rememberedsteps that had grown vague from her ceasing to go to balls shewould go to balls again that seemed freely even crudely stated the remedy she would take out of the deep receptacles inwhich she had laid them away the various ornamentscongruous with the greater occasions and of which her store sheliked to think was none of the smallest she would have beeneasily to be figured for us at this occupation dipping at offmoments and quiet hours in snatched visits and by draughtycandle light into her rich collections and seeing her jewelsagain a little shyly but all unmistakably glow that in factmay pass as the very picture of her semi smothered agitation ofthe diversion she to some extent successfully found in referringher crisis so far as was possible to the mere working of herown needs it must be added however that she would have been at a loss todetermine and certainly at first to which order that ofself control or that of large expression the step she had takenthe afternoon of her husband s return from matcham with hiscompanion properly belonged for it had been a step distinctly on maggie s part her deciding to do something just then andthere which would strike amerigo as unusual and this eventhough her departure from custom had merely consisted in her soarranging that he wouldn t find her as he would definitelyexpect to do in eaton square he would have strangely enough as might seem to him to come back home for it and there get theimpression of her rather pointedly or at least all impatientlyand independently awaiting him these were small variations andmild manoeuvres but they went accompanied on maggie s part aswe have mentioned with an infinite sense of intention herwatching by his fireside for her husband s return from an absencemight superficially have presented itself as the most natural actin the world and the only one into the bargain on which hewould positively have reckoned it fell by this circumstance intothe order of plain matters and yet the very aspect by which itwas in the event handed over to her brooding fancy was the factthat she had done with it all she had designed she had put herthought to the proof and the proof had shown its edge this waswhat was before her that she was no longer playing with bluntand idle tools with weapons that didn t cut there passed acrossher vision ten times a day the gleam of a bare blade and at thisit was that she most shut her eyes most knew the impulse tocheat herself with motion and sound she had merely driven on acertain wednesday to portland place instead of remaining ineaton square and she privately repeated it again and again there had appeared beforehand no reason why she should have seenthe mantle of history flung by a single sharp sweep over socommonplace a deed that all the same was what had happened ithad been bitten into her mind all in an hour that nothing shehad ever done would hereafter in some way yet to be determined so count for her perhaps not even what she had done inaccepting in their old golden rome amerigo s proposal ofmarriage and yet by her little crouching posture there that ofa timid tigress she had meant nothing recklessly ultimate nothing clumsily fundamental so that she called it names theinvidious the grotesque attitude holding it up to her ownridicule reducing so far as she could the portee of what hadfollowed it she had but wanted to get nearer nearer tosomething indeed that she couldn t that she wouldn t even toherself describe and the degree of this achieved nearness waswhat had been in advance incalculable her actual multiplicationof distractions and suppressions whatever it did for her failedto prevent her living over again any chosen minute for she couldchoose them she could fix them of the freshness of relationproduced by her having administered to her husband the firstsurprise to which she had ever treated him it had been a poorthing but it had been all her own and the whole passage wasbackwardly there a great picture hung on the wall of her dailylife for her to make what she would of it fell for retrospect into a succession of moments that werewatchable still almost in the manner of the different thingsdone during a scene on the stage some scene so acted as to haveleft a great impression on the tenant of one of the stalls several of these moments stood out beyond the others and thoseshe could feel again most count again like the firm pearls on astring had belonged more particularly to the lapse of timebefore dinner dinner which had been so late quite at nineo clock that evening thanks to the final lateness of amerigo sown advent these were parts of the experience though in factthere had been a good many of them between which her impressioncould continue sharply to discriminate before the subsequentpassages much later on it was to be said the flame of memoryturned to an equalising glow that of a lamp in some side chapelin which incense was thick the great moment at any rate forconscious repossession was doubtless the first the strangelittle timed silence which she had fully gauged on the spot asaltogether beyond her own intention but which for just howlong should she ever really know for just how long she coulddo nothing to break she was in the smaller drawing room inwhich she always sat and she had by calculation dressed fordinner on finally coming in it was a wonder how many things shehad calculated in respect to this small incident a matter forthe importance of which she had so quite indefinite a measure hewould be late he would be very late that was the one certaintythat seemed to look her in the face there was still also thepossibility that if he drove with charlotte straight to eatonsquare he might think it best to remain there even on learningshe had come away she had left no message for him on any suchchance this was another of her small shades of decision thoughthe effect of it might be to keep him still longer absent hemight suppose she would already have dined he might stay withall he would have to tell just on purpose to be nice to herfather she had known him to stretch the point to thesebeautiful ends far beyond that he had more than once stretchedit to the sacrifice of the opportunity of dressing if she herself had now avoided any such sacrifice and had madeherself during the time at her disposal quite inordinatelyfresh and quite positively smart this had probably added whileshe waited and waited to that very tension of spirit in whichshe was afterwards to find the image of her having crouched shedid her best quite intensely by herself to banish any suchappearance she couldn t help it if she couldn t read her palenovel ah that par exemple was beyond her but she could atleast sit by the lamp with the book sit there with her newestfrock worn for the first time sticking out all round her quite stiff and grand even perhaps a little too stiff and toogrand for a familiar and domestic frock yet marked none theless this time she ventured to hope by incontestable intrinsicmerit she had glanced repeatedly at the clock but she hadrefused herself the weak indulgence of walking up and down though the act of doing so she knew would make her feel on thepolished floor with the rustle and the hang still morebeautifully bedecked the difficulty was that it would also makeher feel herself still more sharply in a state which was exactlywhat she proposed not to do the only drops of her anxiety hadbeen when her thought strayed complacently with her eyes to thefront of her gown which was in a manner a refuge a beguilement especially when she was able to fix it long enough to wonder ifit would at last really satisfy charlotte she had ever been inrespect to her clothes rather timorous and uncertain for thelast year above all she had lived in the light of charlotte spossible and rather inscrutable judgment of them charlotte s ownwere simply the most charming and interesting that any woman hadever put on there was a kind of poetic justice in her being atlast able in this particular thanks to means thanks quite toomnipotence freely to exercise her genius but maggie would havedescribed herself as in these connections constantly andintimately torn conscious on one side of the impossibility ofcopying her companion and conscious on the other of theimpossibility of sounding her independently to the bottom yes it was one of the things she should go down to her grave withouthaving known how charlotte after all had been said reallythought her stepdaughter looked under any supposedly ingeniouspersonal experiment she had always been lovely about thestepdaughter s material braveries had done for her the verybest with them but there had ever fitfully danced at the back ofmaggie s head the suspicion that these expressions were mercies not judgments embodying no absolute but only a relative frankness hadn t charlotte with so perfect a critical vision if the truth were known given her up as hopeless hopeless by aserious standard and thereby invented for her a different andinferior one in which as the only thing to be done shepatiently and soothingly abetted her hadn t she in other words assented in secret despair perhaps even in secret irritation toher being ridiculous so that the best now possible was towonder once in a great while whether one mightn t give her thesurprise of something a little less out of the true note thanusual something of this kind was the question that maggie whilethe absentees still delayed asked of the appearance she wasendeavouring to present but with the result repeatedly again that it only went and lost itself in the thick air that had begunmore and more to hang for our young woman over heraccumulations of the unanswered they were there theseaccumulations they were like a roomful of confused objects never as yet sorted which for some time now she had beenpassing and re passing along the corridor of her life shepassed it when she could without opening the door then onoccasion she turned the key to throw in a fresh contribution soit was that she had been getting things out of the way theyrejoined the rest of the confusion it was as if they found theirplace by some instinct of affinity in the heap they knew inshort where to go and when she at present by a mental act once more pushed the door open she had practically a sense ofmethod and experience what she should never know aboutcharlotte s thought she tossed that in it would find itself incompany and she might at last have been standing there longenough to see it fall into its corner the sight moreover woulddoubtless have made her stare had her attention been more free the sight of the mass of vain things congruous incongruous that awaited every addition it made her in fact with a vaguegasp turn away and what had further determined this was thefinal sharp extinction of the inward scene by the outward thequite different door had opened and her husband was there it had been as strange as she could consent afterwards to thinkit it had been essentially what had made the abrupt bend inher life he had come back had followed her from the otherhouse visibly uncertain this was written in the face he for thefirst minute showed her it had been written only for thoseseconds and it had appeared to go quickly after theybegan to talk but while it lasted it had been written large and though she didn t quite know what she had expected of him she felt she hadn t expected the least shade of embarrassment what had made the embarrassment she called it embarrassment soas to be able to assure herself she put it at the very worst what had made the particular look was his thus distinguishablywishing to see how he should find her why first that had lateron kept coming to her the question dangled there as if it werethe key to everything with the sense of it on the spot she hadfelt overwhelmingly that she was significant that so she mustinstantly strike him and that this had a kind of violence beyondwhat she had intended it was in fact even at the moment notabsent from her view that he might easily have made an abjectfool of her at least for the time she had indeed for just tenseconds been afraid of some such turn the uncertainty in hisface had become so the next thing an uncertainty in the veryair three words of impatience the least bit loud some outbreakof what in the world are you up to and what do you mean anynote of that sort would instantly have brought her low and thisall the more that heaven knew she hadn t in any manner designedto be high it was such a trifle her small breach with custom or at any rate with his natural presumption that all magnitudeof wonder had already had before one could deprecate the shadowof it the effect of a complication it had made for him somedifference that she couldn t measure this meeting him at homeand alone instead of elsewhere and with others and backand back it kept coming to her that the blankness he showed herbefore he was able to see might should she choose to insist onit have a meaning have as who should say an historic value beyond the importance of momentary expressions in general shehad naturally had on the spot no ready notion of what he mightwant to see it was enough for a ready notion not to speak of abeating heart that he did see that he saw his wife in her owndrawing room at the hour when she would most properly be there he hadn t in any way challenged her it was true and afterthose instants during which she now believed him to have beenharbouring the impression of something unusually prepared andpointed in her attitude and array he had advanced upon hersmiling and smiling and thus without hesitation at the last had taken her into his arms the hesitation had been at thefirst and she at present saw that he had surmounted it withouther help she had given him no help for if on the one hand shecouldn t speak for hesitation so on the other and especially ashe didn t ask her she couldn t explain why she was agitated shehad known it all the while down to her toes known it in hispresence with fresh intensity and if he had uttered but aquestion it would have pressed in her the spring of recklessness it had been strange that the most natural thing of all to say tohim should have had that appearance but she was more than everconscious that any appearance she had would come round more orless straight to her father whose life was now so quiet on thebasis accepted for it that any alteration of his consciousnesseven in the possible sense of enlivenment would make theirprecious equilibrium waver that was at the bottom of her mind that their equilibrium was everything and that it waspractically precarious a matter of a hair s breadth for the lossof the balance it was the equilibrium or at all events herconscious fear about it that had brought her heart into hermouth and the same fear was on either side in the silent lookshe and amerigo had exchanged the happy balance that demandedthis amount of consideration was truly thus as by its ownconfession a delicate matter but that her husband had also hishabit of anxiety and his general caution only brought them afterall more closely together it would have been most beautifully therefore in the name of the equilibrium and in that of her joyat their feeling so exactly the same about it that she mighthave spoken if she had permitted the truth on the subject of herbehaviour to ring out on the subject of that poor littlebehaviour which was for the moment so very limited a case ofeccentricity why why have i made this evening such a point of our not alldining together well because i ve all day been so wanting youalone that i finally couldn t bear it and that there didn t seemany great reason why i should try to that came to me funny asit may at first sound with all the things we ve so wonderfullygot into the way of bearing for each other you ve seemed theselast days i don t know what more absent than ever before tooabsent for us merely to go on so it s all very well and iperfectly see how beautiful it is all round but there comes aday when something snaps when the full cup filled to the verybrim begins to flow over that s what has happened to my need ofyou the cup all day has been too full to carry so here i amwith it spilling it over you and just for the reason that isthe reason of my life after all i ve scarcely to explain thati m as much in love with you now as the first hour except thatthere are some hours which i know when they come because theyalmost frighten me that show me i m even more so they come ofthemselves and ah they ve been coming after all afterall some such words as those were what didn t ring out yetit was as if even the unuttered sound had been quenched here inits own quaver it was where utterance would have broken down byits very weight if he had let it get so far without thatextremity at the end of a moment he had taken in what he neededto take that his wife was testifying that she adored and missedand desired him after all after all since she put it so shewas right that was what he had to respond to that was what from the moment that as has been said he saw he had to treatas the most pertinent thing possible he held her close and long in expression of their personal reunion this obviously was oneway of doing so he rubbed his cheek tenderly and with a deepvague murmur against her face that side of her face she was notpressing to his breast that was not less obviously anotherway and there were ways enough in short for his extemporisedease for the good humour she was afterwards to find herselfthinking of as his infinite tact this last was partly no doubt because the question of tact might be felt as having come up atthe end of a quarter of an hour during which he had liberallytalked and she had genially questioned he had told her of hisday the happy thought of his roundabout journey with charlotte all their cathedral hunting adventure and how it had turned outrather more of an affair than they expected the moral of it was at any rate that he was tired verily and must have a bath anddress to which end she would kindly excuse him for the shortesttime possible she was to remember afterwards something that hadpassed between them on this how he had looked for her duringan instant at the door before going out how he had met herasking him in hesitation first then quickly in decision whether she couldn t help him by going up with him he hadperhaps also for a moment hesitated but he had declined heroffer and she was to preserve as i say the memory of the smilewith which he had opined that at that rate they wouldn t dinetill ten o clock and that he should go straighter and fasteralone such things as i say were to come back to her theyplayed through her full after sense like lights on the wholeimpression the subsequent parts of the experience were not tohave blurred their distinctness one of these subsequent parts the first had been the not inconsiderable length to her laterand more analytic consciousness of this second wait for herhusband s reappearance she might certainly with the best willin the world had she gone up with him have been more in his waythan not since people could really almost always hurry betterwithout help than with it still she could actually hardly havemade him take more time than he struck her taking though it mustindeed be added that there was now in this much thinking littleperson s state of mind no mere crudity of impatience somethinghad happened rapidly with the beautiful sight of him and withthe drop of her fear of having annoyed him by making him go toand fro subsidence of the fearsome for maggie s spirit wasalways at first positive emergence of the sweet and it waslong since anything had been so sweet to her as the particularquality suddenly given by her present emotion to the sense ofpossession xxviamerigo was away from her again as she sat there as she walkedthere without him for she had with the difference of hispresence in the house ceased to keep herself from moving about but the hour was filled nevertheless with the effect of hisnearness and above all with the effect strange in an intimacyso established of an almost renewed vision of the facts of hisaspect she had seen him last but five days since yet he hadstood there before her as if restored from some far country somelong voyage some combination of dangers or fatigues thisunquenchable variety in his appeal to her interest what did itmean but that reduced to the flatness of mere statement she wasmarried by good fortune to an altogether dazzling person thatwas an old old story but the truth of it shone out to her likethe beauty of some family picture some mellow portrait of anancestor that she might have been looking at almost insurprise after a long intermission the dazzling person wasupstairs and she was down and there were moreover the otherfacts of the selection and decision that this demonstration ofher own had required and of the constant care that theequilibrium involved but she had all the same never felt soabsorbingly married so abjectly conscious of a master of herfate he could do what he would with her in fact what wasactually happening was that he was actually doing it what hewould what he really would only that quantity itself escapedperhaps in the brightness of the high harmony familiar namingand discussing it was enough of a recognition for her that whatever the thing he might desire he would always absolutelybring it off she knew at this moment without a question withthe fullest surrender how he had brought off in her by scarcemore than a single allusion a perfect flutter of tenderness ifhe had come back tired tired from his long day the exertion hadbeen literally in her service and her father s they two hadsat at home at peace the principino between them thecomplications of life kept down the bores sifted out the largeease of the home preserved because of the way the others heldthe field and braved the weather amerigo never complained anymore than for that matter charlotte did but she seemed to seeto night as she had never yet quite done that their business ofsocial representation conceived as they conceived it beyond anyconception of her own and conscientiously carried out was anaffair of living always in harness she remembered fannyassingham s old judgment that friend s description of her fatherand herself as not living at all as not knowing what to do orwhat might be done for them and there came back to her with itan echo of the long talk they had had together one september dayat fawns under the trees when she put before him this dictum offanny s that occasion might have counted for them she had already oftenmade the reflection as the first step in an existence moreintelligently arranged it had been an hour from which the chainof causes and consequences was definitely traceable so manythings and at the head of the list her father s marriage havingappeared to her to flow from charlotte s visit to fawns and thatevent itself having flowed from the memorable talk but whatperhaps most came out in the light of these concatenations wasthat it had been for all the world as if charlotte had been had in as the servants always said of extra help because theyhad thus suffered it to be pointed out to them that if theirfamily coach lumbered and stuck the fault was in its lacking itscomplement of wheels having but three as they might say it hadwanted another and what had charlotte done from the first butbegin to act on the spot and ever so smoothly and beautifully as a fourth nothing had been immediately more manifest thanthe greater grace of the movement of the vehicle as to which for the completeness of her image maggie was now supremely tofeel how every strain had been lightened for herself so far asshe was one of the wheels she had but to keep in her place sincethe work was done for her she felt no weight and it wasn t toomuch to acknowledge that she had scarce to turn round she had along pause before the fire during which she might have beenfixing with intensity her projected vision have been consciouseven of its taking an absurd fantastic shape she might havebeen watching the family coach pass and noting that somehow amerigo and charlotte were pulling it while she and her fatherwere not so much as pushing they were seated inside together dandling the principino and holding him up to the windows to seeand be seen like an infant positively royal so that theexertion was all with the others maggie found in this image arepeated challenge again and yet again she paused before thefire after which each time in the manner of one for whom astrong light has suddenly broken she gave herself to liveliermovement she had seen herself at last in the picture she wasstudying suddenly jump from the coach whereupon frankly withthe wonder of the sight her eyes opened wider and her heartstood still for a moment she looked at the person so acting asif this person were somebody else waiting with intensity to seewhat would follow the person had taken a decision which wasevidently because an impulse long gathering had at last felt asharpest pressure only how was the decision to be applied what in particular would the figure in the picture do shelooked about her from the middle of the room under the force ofthis question as if there exactly were the field of actioninvolved then as the door opened again she recognised whatever the action the form at any rate of a firstopportunity her husband had reappeared he stood before herrefreshed almost radiant quite reassuring dressed anointed fragrant ready above all for his dinner he smiled at her overthe end of their delay it was as if her opportunity had dependedon his look and now she saw that it was good there was still for the instant something in suspense but it passed morequickly than on his previous entrance he was already holding outhis arms it was for hours and hours later on as if she hadsomehow been lifted aloft were floated and carried on some warmhigh tide beneath which stumbling blocks had sunk out of sight this came from her being again for the time in the enjoyment ofconfidence from her knowing as she believed what to do allthe next day and all the next she appeared to herself to knowit she had a plan and she rejoiced in her plan this consistedof the light that suddenly breaking into her restless reverie had marked the climax of that vigil it had come to her as aquestion what if i ve abandoned them you know what if i veaccepted too passively the funny form of our life there wouldbe a process of her own by which she might do differently inrespect to amerigo and charlotte a process quite independent ofany process of theirs such a solution had but to rise before herto affect her to charm her with its simplicity an advantageoussimplicity she had been stupid for so long not to have beenstruck by and the simplicity meanwhile seemed proved by thesuccess that had already begun to attend her she had only hadherself to do something to see how immediately it answered thisconsciousness of its having answered with her husband was theuplifting sustaining wave he had met her she so put it toherself met her with an effect of generosity and of gaiety inespecial on his coming back to her ready for dinner which shewore in her breast as the token of an escape for them both fromsomething not quite definite but clearly much less good evenat that moment in fact her plan had begun to work she hadbeen when he brightly reappeared in the act of plucking it outof the heart of her earnestness plucking it in the garden ofthought as if it had been some full blown flower that she couldpresent to him on the spot well it was the flower ofparticipation and as that then and there she held it out tohim putting straightway into execution the idea so needlessly so absurdly obscured of her sharing with him whatever theenjoyment the interest the experience might be and sharingalso for that matter with charlotte she had thrown herself at dinner into every feature of therecent adventure of the companions letting him see withoutreserve that she wished to hear everything about it and makingcharlotte in particular charlotte s judgment of matcham charlotte s aspect her success there her effect traceablyproduced her clothes inimitably worn her cleverness gracefullydisplayed her social utility in fine brilliantly exemplified the subject of endless inquiry maggie s inquiry was mostempathetic moreover for the whole happy thought of thecathedral hunt which she was so glad they had entertained andas to the pleasant results of which down to the cold beef andbread and cheese the queer old smell and the dirty table clothat the inn amerigo was good humouredly responsive he had lookedat her across the table more than once as if touched by thehumility of this welcome offered to impressions at second hand the amusements the large freedoms only of others as ifrecognising in it something fairly exquisite and at the end while they were alone before she had rung for a servant he hadrenewed again his condonation of the little irregularity such asit was on which she had ventured they had risen together tocome upstairs he had been talking at the last about some of thepeople at the very last of all about lady castledean and mr blint after which she had once more broken ground on the matterof the type of gloucester it brought her as he came round thetable to join her yet another of his kind conscious stares oneof the looks visibly beguiled but at the same time notinvisibly puzzled with which he had already shown his sense ofthis charming grace of her curiosity it was as if he might for amoment be going to say you needn t pretend dearest quite sohard needn t think it necessary to care quite so much it wasas if he stood there before her with some such easy intelligence some such intimate reassurance on his lips her answer wouldhave been all ready that she wasn t in the least pretending andshe looked up at him while he took her hand with themaintenance the real persistence of her lucid little planin her eyes she wanted him to understand from that very momentthat she was going to be with him again quite with them together as she doubtless hadn t been since the funny changes that was really all one could call them into which theyhad each as for the sake of the others too easily and tooobligingly slipped they had taken too much for granted thattheir life together required as people in london said a special form which was very well so long as the form was kept only forthe outside world and was made no more of among themselves thanthe pretty mould of an iced pudding or something of that sort into which to help yourself you didn t hesitate to break withthe spoon so much as that she would with an opening haveallowed herself furthermore to observe she wanted him tounderstand how her scheme embraced charlotte too so that if hehad but uttered the acknowledgment she judged him on the point ofmaking the acknowledgment of his catching at her brave littleidea for their case she would have found herself as distinctly voluble almost to eloquence what befell however was that even while she thus waited shefelt herself present at a process taking place rather deeperwithin him than the occasion on the whole appeared to require a process of weighing something in the balance of considering deciding dismissing he had guessed that she was there with anidea there in fact by reason of her idea only this oddlyenough was what at the last stayed his words she was helped tothese perceptions by his now looking at her still harder than hehad yet done which really brought it to the turn of a hair forher that she didn t make sure his notion of her idea was theright one it was the turn of a hair because he had possessionof her hands and was bending toward her ever so kindly as if tosee to understand more or possibly give more she didn t knowwhich and that had the effect of simply putting her as shewould have said in his power she gave up let her idea go leteverything go her one consciousness was that he was taking heragain into his arms it was not till afterwards that shediscriminated as to this felt how the act operated with himinstead of the words he hadn t uttered operated in his view asprobably better than any words as always better in fact at anytime than anything her acceptance of it her response to it inevitable foredoomed came back to her later on as a virtualassent to the assumption he had thus made that there was reallynothing such a demonstration didn t anticipate and didn t disposeof and that the spring acting within herself moreover might wellhave been beyond any other the impulse legitimately to provokeit it made for any issue the third time since his return thathe had drawn her to his breast and at present holding her tohis side as they left the room he kept her close for theirmoving into the hall and across it kept her for their slowreturn together to the apartments above he had been right overwhelmingly right as to the felicity of his tenderness andthe degree of her sensibility but even while she felt thesethings sweep all others away she tasted of a sort of terror ofthe weakness they produced in her it was still for her thatshe had positively something to do and that she mustn t be weakfor this must much rather be strong for many hours after nonethe less she remained weak if weak it was though holding fastindeed to the theory of her success since her agitated overturehad been after all so unmistakably met she recovered soon enough on the whole the sense that this lefther charlotte always to deal with charlotte who at any rate however she might meet overtures must meet them at the worst more or less differently of that inevitability of such otherranges of response as were open to charlotte maggie took themeasure in approaching her on the morrow of her return frommatcham with the same show of desire to hear all her story shewanted the whole picture from her as she had wanted it from hercompanion and promptly in eaton square whither without theprince she repaired almost ostentatiously for the purpose this purpose only she brought her repeatedly back to thesubject both in her husband s presence and during several scrapsof independent colloquy before her father instinctively maggietook the ground that his wish for interesting echoes would be notless than her own allowing that is for everything his wifewould already have had to tell him for such passages betweenthem as might have occurred since the evening before joiningthem after luncheon reaching them in her desire to proceed withthe application of her idea before they had quitted thebreakfast room the scene of their mid day meal she referred inher parent s presence to what she might have lost by delay andexpressed the hope that there would be an anecdote or two leftfor her to pick up charlotte was dressed to go out and herhusband it appeared rather positively prepared not to he hadleft the table but was seated near the fire with two or three ofthe morning papers and the residuum of the second and third postson a stand beside him more even than the usual extravagance asmaggie s glance made out of circulars catalogues advertisements announcements of sales foreign envelopes andforeign handwritings that were as unmistakable as foreignclothes charlotte at the window looking into the side streetthat abutted on the square might have been watching for theirvisitor s advent before withdrawing and in the light strangeand coloured like that of a painted picture which fixed theimpression for her objects took on values not hitherto so fullyshown it was the effect of her quickened sensibility she knewherself again in presence of a problem in need of a solution forwhich she must intensely work that consciousness lately born inher had been taught the evening before to accept a temporarylapse but had quickly enough again with her getting out of herown house and her walking across half the town for she had comefrom portland place on foot found breath still in its lungs it exhaled this breath in a sigh faint and unheard her tribute while she stood there before speaking to realities loomingthrough the golden mist that had already begun to be scattered the conditions facing her had yielded for the time to thegolden mist had considerably melted away but there they wereagain definite and it was for the next quarter of an hour as ifshe could have counted them one by one on her fingers sharp toher above all was the renewed attestation of her father scomprehensive acceptances which she had so long regarded as ofthe same quality with her own but which so distinctly now sheshould have the complication of being obliged to deal withseparately they had not yet struck her as absolutelyextraordinary which had made for her lumping them with her own since her view of her own had but so lately begun to change though it instantly stood out for her that there was really nonew judgment of them she should be able to show withoutattracting in some degree his attention without perhaps excitinghis surprise and making thereby for the situation she sharedwith him some difference she was reminded and warned by theconcrete image and for a minute charlotte s face immediatelypresented to her affected her as searching her own to see thereminder tell she had not less promptly kissed her stepmother and then had bent over her father from behind and laid hercheek upon him little amenities tantamount heretofore to an easychange of guard charlotte s own frequent though alwayscheerful term of comparison for this process of transfer maggiefigured thus as the relieving sentry and so smoothly did use andcustom work for them that her mate might even on this occasion after acceptance of the pass word have departed withoutirrelevant and in strictness unsoldierly gossip this was not none the less what happened inasmuch as if our young woman hadbeen floated over her first impulse to break the existing charmat a stroke it yet took her but an instant to sound at anyrisk the note she had been privately practising if she hadpractised it the day before at dinner on amerigo she knew butthe better how to begin for it with mrs verver and it immenselyhelped her for that matter to be able at once to speak of theprince as having done more to quicken than to soothe hercuriosity frankly and gaily she had come to ask to ask what intheir unusually prolonged campaign the two had achieved she hadgot out of her husband she admitted what she could buthusbands were never the persons who answered such questionsideally he had only made her more curious and she had arrivedearly this way in order to miss as little as possible ofcharlotte s story wives papa she said are always much better reporters though i grant she added for charlotte that fathers are notmuch better than husbands he never she smiled tells me morethan a tenth of what you tell him so i hope you haven t told himeverything yet since in that case i shall probably have lost thebest part of it maggie went she went she felt herself going she reminded herself of an actress who had been studying a partand rehearsing it but who suddenly on the stage before thefootlights had begun to improvise to speak lines not in thetext it was this very sense of the stage and the footlights thatkept her up made her rise higher just as it was the sense ofaction that logically involved some platform action quitepositively for the first time in her life or counting in theprevious afternoon for the second the platform remained forthree or four days thus sensibly under her feet and she had allthe while with it the inspiration of quite remarkably of quiteheroically improvising preparation and practice had come but ashort way her part opened out and she invented from moment tomoment what to say and to do she had but one rule of art tokeep within bounds and not lose her head certainly she might seefor a week how far that would take her she said to herself inher excitement that it was perfectly simple to bring about adifference touch by touch without letting either of the three and least of all her father so much as suspect her hand if theyshould suspect they would want a reason and the humiliatingtruth was that she wasn t ready with a reason not that is withwhat she would have called a reasonable one she thought ofherself instinctively beautifully as having dealt all herlife at her father s side and by his example only in reasonablereasons and what she would really have been most ashamed ofwould be to produce for him in this line some inferiorsubstitute unless she were in a position to plead definitely that she was jealous she should be in no position to plead decently that she was dissatisfied this latter condition wouldbe a necessary implication of the former without the formerbehind it it would have to fall to the ground so had the case wonderfully been arranged for her there was a card she couldplay but there was only one and to play it would be to end thegame she felt herself as at the small square green table between the tall old silver candlesticks and the neatly arrangedcounters her father s playmate and partner and what itconstantly came back to in her mind was that for her to ask aquestion to raise a doubt to reflect in any degree on the playof the others would be to break the charm the charm she had tocall it since it kept her companion so constantly engaged so perpetually seated and so contentedly occupied to sayanything at all would be in fine to have to say why she wasjealous and she could in her private hours but stare long with suffused eyes at that impossibility by the end of a week the week that had begun especially withher morning hour in eaton square between her father and hiswife her consciousness of being beautifully treated had becomeagain verily greater than her consciousness of anything else andi must add moreover that she at last found herself rather oddlywondering what else as a consciousness could have been quite sooverwhelming charlotte s response to the experiment of beingmore with her ought as she very well knew to have stamped theexperiment with the feeling of success so that if the successitself seemed a boon less substantial than the original image ofit it enjoyed thereby a certain analogy with our young woman saftertaste of amerigo s own determined demonstrations maggie wasto have retained for that matter more than one aftertaste andif i have spoken of the impressions fixed in her as soon as shehad so insidiously taken the field a definite note must bemade of her perception during those moments of charlotte sprompt uncertainty she had shown no doubt she couldn t nothave shown that she had arrived with an idea quite exactly asshe had shown her husband the night before that she wasawaiting him with a sentiment this analogy in the two situationswas to keep up for her the remembrance of a kinship of expressionin the two faces in respect to which all she as yet professed toherself was that she had affected them or at any rate thesensibility each of them so admirably covered in the same way to make the comparison at all was for maggie to return to itoften to brood upon it to extract from it the last dregs of itsinterest to play with it in short nervously vaguely incessantly as she might have played with a medallion containingon either side a cherished little portrait and suspended roundher neck by a gold chain of a firm fineness that no effort wouldever snap the miniatures were back to back but she saw themforever face to face and when she looked from one to the othershe found in charlotte s eyes the gleam of the momentary whatdoes she really want that had come and gone for her in theprince s so again she saw the other light the light touchedinto a glow both in portland place and in eaton square as soonas she had betrayed that she wanted no harm wanted no greaterharm of charlotte that is than to take in that she meant to goout with her she had been present at that process as personallyas she might have been present at some other domestic incident the hanging of a new picture say or the fitting of theprincipino with his first little trousers she remained present accordingly all the week so charminglyand systematically did mrs verver now welcome her company charlotte had but wanted the hint and what was it but the hint after all that during the so subdued but so ineffaceablepassage in the breakfast room she had seen her take it had beentaken moreover not with resignation not with qualifications orreserves however bland it had been taken with avidity withgratitude with a grace of gentleness that supplantedexplanations the very liberality of this accommodation mightindeed have appeared in the event to give its own account of thematter as if it had fairly written the princess down as a personof variations and had accordingly conformed but to a rule of tactin accepting these caprices for law the caprice actuallyprevailing happened to be that the advent of one of the ladiesanywhere should till the fit had changed become the sign unfailingly of the advent of the other and it was emblazoned in rich colour on the bright face of this period that mrs verver only wished to know on any occasion what was expected ofher only held herself there for instructions in order even tobetter them if possible the two young women while the passagelasted became again very much the companions of other days thedays of charlotte s prolonged visits to the admiring andbountiful maggie the days when equality of condition for themhad been all the result of the latter s native vagueness abouther own advantages the earlier elements flushed into life again the frequency the intimacy the high pitch of accompanyingexpression appreciation endearment confidence the rarer charmproduced in each by this active contribution to the felicity ofthe other all enhanced furthermore enhanced or qualified whoshould say which by a new note of diplomacy almost of anxiety just sensible on charlotte s part in particular of intensity ofobservance in the matter of appeal and response in thematter of making sure the princess might be disposed orgratified that resembled an attempt to play again with morerefinement at disparity of relation charlotte s attitude had in short its moments of flowering into pretty excesses ofcivility self effacements in the presence of others suddenlittle formalisms of suggestion and recognition that might haverepresented her sense of the duty of not losing sight of asocial distinction this impression came out most for maggiewhen in their easier intervals they had only themselves toregard and when her companion s inveteracy of never passingfirst of not sitting till she was seated of not interruptingtill she appeared to give leave of not forgetting too familiarly that in addition to being important she was alsosensitive had the effect of throwing over their intercourse akind of silver tissue of decorum it hung there above them like acanopy of state a reminder that though the lady in waiting wasan established favourite safe in her position a little queen however good natured was always a little queen and might withsmall warning remember it and yet another of these concomitants of feverish success allthe while was the perception that in another quarter too thingswere being made easy charlotte s alacrity in meeting her had inone sense operated slightly overmuch as an intervention it hadbegun to reabsorb her at the very hour of her husband s showingher that to be all there as the phrase was he likewise onlyrequired as one of the other phrases was too the straight tip she had heard him talk about the straight tip in his moods ofamusement at english slang in his remarkable displays ofassimilative power power worthy of better causes and higherinspirations and he had taken it from her at need in a waythat certainly in the first glow of relief had made her briefinterval seem large then however immediately and even thoughsuperficially there had declared itself a readjustment ofrelations to which she was once more practically a littlesacrificed i must do everything she had said withoutletting papa see what i do at least till it s done but shescarce knew how she proposed even for the next few days toblind or beguile this participant in her life what had in factpromptly enough happened she presently recognised was that ifher stepmother had beautifully taken possession of her and ifshe had virtually been rather snatched again thereby from herhusband s side so on the other hand this had with as littledelay entailed some very charming assistance for her in eatonsquare when she went home with charlotte from whatever happydemonstration for the benefit of the world in which theysupposed themselves to live that there was no smallest reasonwhy their closer association shouldn t be public and acclaimed at these times she regularly found that amerigo had come eitherto sit with his father in law in the absence of the ladies or tomake on his side precisely some such display of the easyworking of the family life as would represent the equivalent ofher excursions with charlotte under this particular impressionit was that everything in maggie most melted and went to pieces every thing that is that belonged to her disposition tochallenge the perfection of their common state it divided themagain that was true this particular turn of the tide cut themup afresh into pairs and parties quite as if a sense for theequilibrium was what between them all had most power ofinsistence quite as if amerigo himself were all the while atbottom equally thinking of it and watching it but as againstthat he was making her father not miss her and he could haverendered neither of them a more excellent service he was actingin short on a cue the cue given him by observation it had beenenough for him to see the shade of change in her behaviour hisinstinct for relations the most exquisite conceivable promptedhim immediately to meet and match the difference to play somehowinto its hands that was what it was she renewedly felt to havemarried a man who was sublimely a gentleman so that in spiteof her not wanting to translate all their delicacies into thegrossness of discussion she yet found again and again inportland place moments for saying if i didn t love you youknow for yourself i should still love you for him he lookedat her after such speeches as charlotte looked in eatonsquare when she called her attention to his benevolence throughthe dimness of the almost musing smile that took account of herextravagance harmless though it might be as a tendency toreckon with but my poor child charlotte might under thispressure have been on the point of replying that s the way nicepeople are all round so that why should one be surprised aboutit we re all nice together as why shouldn t we be if we hadn tbeen we wouldn t have gone far and i consider that we ve gonevery far indeed why should you take on as if you weren t aperfect dear yourself capable of all the sweetest things as ifyou hadn t in fact grown up in an atmosphere the atmosphere ofall the good things that i recognised even of old as soon as icame near you and that you ve allowed me now between you tomake so blessedly my own mrs verver might in fact have butjust failed to make another point a point charmingly natural toher as a grateful and irreproachable wife it isn t a bitwonderful i may also remind you that your husband should find when opportunity permits worse things to do than to go aboutwith mine i happen love to appreciate my husband i happenperfectly to understand that his acquaintance should becultivated and his company enjoyed some such happily provoked remarks as these from charlotte atthe other house had been in the air but we have seen how therewas also in the air for our young woman as an emanation fromthe same source a distilled difference of which the veryprinciple was to keep down objections and retorts thatimpression came back it had its hours of doing so and it mayinterest us on the ground of its having prompted in maggie afinal reflection a reflection out of the heart of which a lightflashed for her like a great flower grown in a night as soon asthis light had spread a little it produced in some quarters asurprising distinctness made her of a sudden ask herself whythere should have been even for three days the least obscurity the perfection of her success decidedly was like some strangeshore to which she had been noiselessly ferried and where with astart she found herself quaking at the thought that the boatmight have put off again and left her the word for it the wordthat flashed the light was that they were treating her thatthey were proceeding with her and for that matter with herfather by a plan that was the exact counterpart of her own itwas not from her that they took their cue but and this was whatin particular made her sit up from each other and with a depthof unanimity an exact coincidence of inspiration that when onceher attention had begun to fix it struck her as staring out ather in recovered identities of behaviour expression and tone they had a view of her situation and of the possible forms herown consciousness of it might take a view determined by thechange of attitude they had had ever so subtly to recognise inher on their return from matcham they had had to read into thissmall and all but suppressed variation a mute comment on theydidn t quite know what and it now arched over the princess shead like a vault of bold span that important communicationbetween them on the subject couldn t have failed of beingimmediate this new perception bristled for her as we have said with odd intimations but questions unanswered played in and outof it as well the question for instance of why suchpromptitude of harmony should have been important ah when shebegan to recover piece by piece the process became lively shemight have been picking small shining diamonds out of thesweepings of her ordered house she bent in this pursuit overher dust bin she challenged to the last grain the refuse of herinnocent economy then it was that the dismissed vision ofamerigo that evening in arrest at the door of her salottinowhile her eyes from her placed chair took him in then it wasthat this immense little memory gave out its full power sincethe question was of doors she had afterwards she now saw shutit out she had responsibly shut in as we have understood shutin there with her sentient self only the fact of hisreappearance and the plenitude of his presence these things hadbeen testimony after all to supersede any other for on thespot even while she looked the warmly washing wave hadtravelled far up the strand she had subsequently lived forhours she couldn t count under the dizzying smothering welterpositively in submarine depths where everything came to herthrough walls of emerald and mother of pearl though indeed shehad got her head above them for breath when face to face withcharlotte again on the morrow in eaton square meanwhile nonethe less as was so apparent the prior the prime impression hadremained in the manner of a spying servant on the other side ofthe barred threshold a witness availing himself in time of thelightest pretext to re enter it was as if he had found thispretext in her observed necessity of comparing comparing theobvious common elements in her husband s and her stepmother sways of now taking her with or without her witness at anyrate she was led by comparison to a sense of the quantity ofearnest intention operating and operating so harmoniously between her companions and it was in the mitigated midnight ofthese approximations that she had made out the promise of herdawn it was a worked out scheme for their not wounding her for theirbehaving to her quite nobly to which each had in some winningway induced the other to contribute and which therefore so faras that went proved that she had become with them a subject ofintimate study quickly quickly on a certain alarm taken eagerly and anxiously before they should without knowing it wound her they had signalled from house to house their cleveridea the idea by which for all these days her own idea hadbeen profiting they had built her in with their purpose whichwas why above her a vault seemed more heavily to arch so thatshe sat there in the solid chamber of her helplessness as in abath of benevolence artfully prepared for her over the brim ofwhich she could but just manage to see by stretching her neck baths of benevolence were very well but at least unless onewere a patient of some sort a nervous eccentric or a lost child one was usually not so immersed save by one s request it wasn tin the least what she had requested she had flapped her littlewings as a symbol of desired flight not merely as a plea for amore gilded cage and an extra allowance of lumps of sugar aboveall she hadn t complained not by the quaver of a syllable sowhat wound in particular had she shown her fear of receiving what wound had she received as to which she had exchanged theleast word with them if she had ever whined or moped they mighthave had some reason but she would be hanged she conversed withherself in strong language if she had been from beginning toend anything but pliable and mild it all came back inconsequence to some required process of their own a processoperating quite positively as a precaution and a policy theyhad got her into the bath and for consistency with themselves which was with each other must keep her there in that conditionshe wouldn t interfere with the policy which was established which was arranged her thought over this arrived at a greatintensity had indeed its pauses and timidities but always totake afterwards a further and lighter spring the ground waswell nigh covered by the time she had made out her husband andhis colleague as directly interested in preventing her freedom ofmovement policy or no policy it was they themselves who werearranged she must be kept in position so as not to disarrangethem it fitted immensely together the whole thing as soon asshe could give them a motive for strangely as it had by thistime begun to appear to herself she had hitherto not imaginedthem sustained by an ideal distinguishably different from herown of course they were arranged all four arranged but whathad the basis of their life been precisely but that they werearranged together amerigo and charlotte were arranged together but she to confine the matter only to herself was arrangedapart it rushed over her the full sense of all this with quiteanother rush from that of the breaking wave of ten days before and as her father himself seemed not to meet the vaguely clutching hand with which during the first shock of completeperception she tried to steady herself she felt very muchalone xxviithere had been from far back that is from the christmas timeon a plan that the parent and the child should do somethinglovely together and they had recurred to it on occasion nursedit and brought it up theoretically though without as yet quiteallowing it to put its feet to the ground the most it had donewas to try a few steps on the drawing room carpet with muchattendance on either side much holding up and guarding muchanticipation in fine of awkwardness or accident theircompanions by the same token had constantly assisted at theperformance following the experiment with sympathy and gaiety and never so full of applause maggie now made out for herself as when the infant project had kicked its little legs mostwildly kicked them for all the world across the channel andhalf the continent kicked them over the pyrenees and innocentlycrowed out some rich spanish name she asked herself at presentif it had been a real belief that they were but wanting forsome such adventure to snatch their moment whether either hadat any instant seen it as workable save in the form of a toy todangle before the other that they should take flight withoutwife or husband for one more look before they died at themadrid pictures as well as for a drop of further weak delay inrespect to three or four possible prizes privately offered rarities of the first water responsibly reported on andprofusely photographed still patiently awaiting their noiselessarrival in retreats to which the clue had not otherwise beengiven away the vision dallied with during the duskier days ineaton square had stretched to the span of three or four weeks ofspringtime for the total adventure three or four weeks in thevery spirit after all of their regular life as their regularlife had been persisting full of shared mornings afternoons evenings walks drives looks in at old places on vaguechances full also in especial of that purchased social ease the sense of the comfort and credit of their house which hadessentially the perfection of something paid for but which came on the whole so cheap that it might have been felt ascosting as costing the parent and child nothing it was formaggie to wonder at present if she had been sincere about theirgoing to ask herself whether she would have stuck to their planeven if nothing had happened her view of the impossibility of sticking to it now may give usthe measure of her sense that everything had happened adifference had been made in her relation to each of hercompanions and what it compelled her to say to herself was thatto behave as she might have behaved before would be to act foramerigo and charlotte with the highest hypocrisy she saw inthese days that a journey abroad with her father would more thananything else have amounted on his part and her own to a lastexpression of an ecstasy of confidence and that the charm of theidea in fact had been in some such sublimity day after day sheput off the moment of speaking as she inwardly and verycomprehensively called it speaking that is to her father andall the more that she was ridden by a strange suspense as to hishimself breaking silence she gave him time gave him duringseveral days that morning that noon that night and the nextand the next and the next even made up her mind that if he stoodoff longer it would be proof conclusive that he too wasn t atpeace they would then have been all successfully throwing dustin each other s eyes and it would be at last as if they mustturn away their faces since the silver mist that protected themhad begun to grow sensibly thin finally at the end of april she decided that if he should say nothing for another period oftwenty four hours she must take it as showing that they were inher private phraseology lost so little possible sincerity couldthere be in pretending to care for a journey to spain at theapproach of a summer that already promised to be hot such aproposal on his lips such an extravagance of optimism would behis way of being consistent for that he didn t really want tomove or to move further at the worst than back to fawns again could only signify that he wasn t at heart contented what hewanted at any rate and what he didn t want were in the event put to the proof for maggie just in time to give her a freshwind she had been dining with her husband in eaton square onthe occasion of hospitality offered by mr and mrs verver tolord and lady castledean the propriety of some demonstration ofthis sort had been for many days before our group the questionreduced to the mere issue of which of the two houses should firsttake the field the issue had been easily settled in the mannerof every issue referred in any degree to amerigo and charlotte the initiative obviously belonged to mrs verver who had gone tomatcham while maggie had stayed away and the evening in eatonsquare might have passed for a demonstration all the morepersonal that the dinner had been planned on intimate lines six other guests only in addition to the host and the hostess ofmatcham made up the company and each of these persons had formaggie the interest of an attested connection with the easterrevels at that visionary house their common memory of anoccasion that had clearly left behind it an ineffaceable charm this air of beatific reference less subdued in the others thanin amerigo and charlotte lent them together an inscrutablecomradeship against which the young woman s imagination broke ina small vain wave it wasn t that she wished she had been of the remembered partyand possessed herself of its secrets for she didn t care aboutits secrets she could concern herself at present absolutely with no secret but her own what occurred was simply that shebecame aware at a stroke of the quantity of further nourishmentrequired by her own and of the amount of it she might somehowextract from these people whereby she rose of a sudden to thedesire to possess and use them even to the extent of braving offairly defying of directly exploiting of possibly quiteenjoying under cover of an evil duplicity the felt element ofcuriosity with which they regarded her once she was conscious ofthe flitting wing of this last impression the perception irresistible that she was something for their queer experience just as they were something for hers there was no limit to herconceived design of not letting them escape she went and went again to night after her start was taken went positively asshe had felt herself going three weeks before on the morningwhen the vision of her father and his wife awaiting her togetherin the breakfast room had been so determinant in this otherscene it was lady castledean who was determinant who kindled thelight or at all events the heat and who acted on the nerves lady castledean whom she knew she so oddly didn t like inspite of reasons upon reasons the biggest diamonds on theyellowest hair the longest lashes on the prettiest falsesteyes the oldest lace on the most violet velvet the rightestmanner on the wrongest assumption her ladyship s assumption wasthat she kept at every moment of her life every advantage itmade her beautifully soft very nearly generous so she didn tdistinguish the little protuberant eyes of smaller socialinsects often endowed with such a range from the otherdecorative spots on their bodies and wings maggie had liked inlondon and in the world at large so many more people than shehad thought it right to fear right even to so much as judge that it positively quickened her fever to have to recognise inthis case such a lapse of all the sequences it was only that acharming clever woman wondered about her that is wondered abouther as amerigo s wife and wondered moreover with the intentionof kindness and the spontaneity almost of surprise the point of view that one was what she read in their freecontemplation in that of the whole eight there was something inamerigo to be explained and she was passed about all tenderlyand expertly like a dressed doll held in the right manner byits firmly stuffed middle for the account she could give shemight have been made to give it by pressure of her stomach shemight have been expected to articulate with a rare imitation ofnature oh yes i m here all the while i m also in my way asolid little fact and i cost originally a great deal of money cost that is my father for my outfit and let in my husbandfor an amount of pains toward my training that money wouldscarce represent well she would meet them in some such way and she translated her idea into action after dinner beforethey dispersed by engaging them all unconventionally almostviolently to dine with her in portland place just as they were if they didn t mind the same party which was the party shewanted oh she was going she was going she could feel itafresh it was a good deal as if she had sneezed ten times or hadsuddenly burst into a comic song there were breaks in theconnection as there would be hitches in the process she didn twholly see yet what they would do for her nor quite how herself she should handle them but she was dancing up and down beneath her propriety with the thought that she had at leastbegun something she so fairly liked to feel that she was a pointfor convergence of wonder it wasn t after all either thattheir wonder so much signified that of the cornered six whom itglimmered before her that she might still live to drive aboutlike a flock of sheep the intensity of her consciousness itssharpest savour was in the theory of her having diverted having as they said captured the attention of amerigo andcharlotte at neither of whom all the while did she so much asonce look she had pitched them in with the six for that matter so far as they themselves were concerned they had dropped forthe succession of minutes out of contact with their function had in short startled and impressed abandoned their post they re paralysed they re paralysed she commented deepwithin so much it helped her own apprehension to hang togetherthat they should suddenly lose their bearings her grasp of appearances was thus out of proportion to her viewof causes but it came to her then and there that if she couldonly get the facts of appearance straight only jam them downinto their place the reasons lurking behind them keptuncertain for the eyes by their wavering and shifting wouldn tperhaps be able to help showing it wasn t of course that theprince and mrs verver marvelled to see her civil to theirfriends it was rather precisely that civil was just what shewasn t she had so departed from any such custom of delicateapproach approach by the permitted note the suggested if theaccepted vagueness as would enable the people in question to puther off if they wished and the profit of her plan the effect ofthe violence she was willing to let it go for was exactly intheir being the people in question people she had seemed to berather shy of before and for whom she suddenly opened her mouthso wide later on we may add with the ground soon covered byher agitated but resolute step it was to cease to matter whatpeople they were or weren t but meanwhile the particular senseof them that she had taken home to night had done her the serviceof seeming to break the ice where that formation was thickest still more unexpectedly the service might have been the same forher father inasmuch as immediately when everyone had gone hedid exactly what she had been waiting for and despairing of anddid it as he did everything with a simplicity that left anypurpose of sounding him deeper of drawing him out further ofgoing in his own frequent phrase behind what he said nothingwhatever to do he brought it out straight made it bravely andbeautifully irrelevant save for the plea of what they shouldlose by breaking the charm i guess we won t go down there afterall will we mag just when it s getting so pleasant here that was all with nothing to lead up to it but it was done forher at a stroke and done not less more rather for amerigo andcharlotte on whom the immediate effect as she secretly as shealmost breathlessly measured it was prodigious everything nowso fitted for her to everything else that she could feel theeffect as prodigious even while sticking to her policy of givingthe pair no look there were thus some five wonderful minutesduring which they loomed to her sightless eyes on either sideof her larger than they had ever loomed before larger thanlife larger than thought larger than any danger or any safety there was thus a space of time in fine fairly vertiginous forher during which she took no more account of them than if theywere not in the room she had never never treated them in any such way not even justnow when she had plied her art upon the matcham band herpresent manner was an intenser exclusion and the air was chargedwith their silence while she talked with her other companion asif she had nothing but him to consider he had given her the noteamazingly by his allusion to the pleasantness that of such anoccasion as his successful dinner which might figure as theirbribe for renouncing so that it was all as if they were speakingselfishly counting on a repetition of just such extensions ofexperience maggie achieved accordingly an act of unprecedentedenergy threw herself into her father s presence as by theabsolute consistency with which she held his eyes saying toherself at the same time that she smiled and talked andinaugurated her system what does he mean by it that s thequestion what does he mean but studying again all the signs inhim that recent anxiety had made familiar and counting thestricken minutes on the part of the others it was in theirsilence that the others loomed as she felt she had had nomeasure she afterwards knew of this duration but it drew outand out really to what would have been called in simplerconditions awkwardness as if she herself were stretching thecord ten minutes later however in the homeward carriage towhich her husband cutting delay short had proceeded at thefirst announcement ten minutes later she was to stretch italmost to breaking the prince had permitted her to linger muchless before his move to the door than they usually lingered atthe gossiping close of such evenings which she all responsive took for a sign of his impatience to modify for her the oddeffect of his not having and of charlotte s not having instantly acclaimed the issue of the question debated or moreexactly settled before them he had had time to become aware ofthis possible impression in her and his virtually urging herinto the carriage was connected with his feeling that he musttake action on the new ground a certain ambiguity in her wouldabsolutely have tormented him but he had already found somethingto soothe and correct as to which she had on her side a shrewdnotion of what it would be she was herself for that matter prepared and she was of a truth as she took her seat in thebrougham amazed at her preparation it allowed her scarce aninterval she brought it straight out i was certain that was what father would say if i should leavehim alone i have been leaving him alone and you see the effect he hates now to move he likes too much to be with us but if yousee the effect she felt herself magnificently keeping it up perhaps you don t see the cause the cause my dear is toolovely her husband on taking his place beside her had during a minuteor two for her watching sense neither said nor done anything he had been for that sense as if thinking waiting deciding yet it was still before he spoke that he as she felt it to be definitely acted he put his arm round her and drew her close indulged in the demonstration the long firm embrace by hissingle arm the infinite pressure of her whole person to his own that such opportunities had so often suggested and prescribed held accordingly and as she could but too intimately feel exquisitely solicited she had said the thing she was intendingand desiring to say and as to which she felt even more than shefelt anything else that whatever he might do she mustn t beirresponsible yes she was in his exerted grasp and she knewwhat that was but she was at the same time in the grasp of herconceived responsibility and the extraordinary thing was that of the two intensities the second was presently to become thesharper he took his time for it meanwhile but he met her speechafter a fashion the cause of your father s deciding not to go yes and of my having wanted to let it act for him quietly imean without my insistence she had in her compressed state another pause and it made her feel as if she were immenselyresisting strange enough was this sense for her and altogethernew the sense of possessing by miraculous help some advantagethat absolutely then and there in the carriage as they rolled she might either give up or keep strange inexpressiblystrange so distinctly she saw that if she did give it up sheshould somehow give up everything for ever and what herhusband s grasp really meant as her very bones registered wasthat she should give it up it was exactly for this that he hadresorted to unfailing magic he knew how to resort to it hecould be on occasion as she had lately more than ever learned so munificent a lover all of which was precisely a part of thecharacter she had never ceased to regard in him as princely apart of his large and beautiful ease his genius for charm forintercourse for expression for life she should have but to layher head back on his shoulder with a certain movement to make itdefinite for him that she didn t resist to this as they went every throb of her consciousness prompted her every throb thatis but one the throb of her deeper need to know where she really was by the time she had uttered the rest of her idea therefore she was still keeping her head and intending to keepit though she was also staring out of the carriage window witheyes into which the tears of suffered pain had risen indistinguishable perhaps happily in the dusk she was makingan effort that horribly hurt her and as she couldn t cry out her eyes swam in her silence with them all the same throughthe square opening beside her through the grey panorama of thelondon night she achieved the feat of not losing sight of whatshe wanted and her lips helped and protected her by being ableto be gay it s not to leave you my dear for that he ll giveup anything just as he would go off anywhere i think you know if you would go with him i mean you and he alone maggiepursued with her gaze out of her window for which amerigo s answer again took him a moment ah the dearold boy you would like me to propose him something well if you think you could bear it and leave the prince asked you and charlotte alone why not maggie had also to wait a minute but when she spokeit came clear why shouldn t charlotte be just one of myreasons my not liking to leave her she has always been so good so perfect to me but never so wonderfully as just now we havesomehow been more together thinking for the time almost onlyof each other it has been quite as in old days and sheproceeded consummately for she felt it as consummate it s asif we had been missing each other had got a little apart thoughgoing on so side by side but the good moments if one only waitsfor them she hastened to add come round of themselves moreover you ve seen for yourself since you ve made it up so tofather feeling for yourself in your beautiful way everydifference every air that blows not having to be told orpushed only being perfect to live with through your habit ofkindness and your exquisite instincts but of course you veseen all the while that both he and i have deeply felt howyou ve managed managed that he hasn t been too much alone andthat i on my side haven t appeared to what you might call neglect him this is always she continued what i can neverbless you enough for of all the good things you ve done for meyou ve never done anything better she went on explaining as forthe pleasure of explaining even though knowing he mustrecognise as a part of his easy way too her description of hislarge liberality your taking the child down yourself thosedays and your coming each time to bring him away nothing inthe world nothing you could have invented would have keptfather more under the charm besides you know how you ve alwayssuited him and how you ve always so beautifully let it seem tohim that he suits you only it has been these last weeks as ifyou wished just in order to please him to remind him of itafresh so there it is she wound up it s your doing you veproduced your effect that of his wanting not to be even for amonth or two where you re not he doesn t want to bother or boreyou that i think you know he never has done and if you llonly give me time i ll come round again to making it my care asalways that he shan t but he can t bear you out of his sight she had kept it up and up filling it out crowding it in andall really without difficulty for it was every word of it thanks to a long evolution of feeling what she had been primedto the brim with she made the picture forced it upon him hungit before him remembering happily how he had gone so far oneday supported by the principino as to propose the zoo in eatonsquare to carry with him there on the spot under this pleasantinspiration both his elder and his younger companion with thelatter of whom he had taken the tone that they were introducinggranddaddy granddaddy nervous and rather funking it to lionsand tigers more or less at large touch by touch she thus droppedinto her husband s silence the truth about his good nature andhis good manners and it was this demonstration of his virtue precisely that added to the strangeness even for herself ofher failing as yet to yield to him it would be a question but ofthe most trivial act of surrender the vibration of a nerve themere movement of a muscle but the act grew important betweenthem just through her doing perceptibly nothing nothing but talkin the very tone that would naturally have swept her intotenderness she knew more and more every lapsing minute taughther how he might by a single rightness make her cease to watchhim that rightness a million miles removed from the queeractual falling so short which would consist of his breaking outto her diviningly indulgently with the last happyinconsequence come away with me somewhere you and then weneedn t think we needn t even talk of anything of anyoneelse five words like that would answer her would break herutterly down but they were the only ones that would so serve she waited for them and there was a supreme instant when by thetestimony of all the rest of him she seemed to feel them in hisheart and on his lips only they didn t sound and as that madeher wait again so it made her more intensely watch this in turnshowed her that he too watched and waited and how much he hadexpected something that he now felt wouldn t come yes itwouldn t come if he didn t answer her if he but said the wrongthings instead of the right if he could say the right everythingwould come it hung by a hair that everything might crystallisefor their recovered happiness at his touch this possibilityglowed at her however for fifty seconds only then to turncold and as it fell away from her she felt the chill of realityand knew again all but pressed to his heart and with his breathupon her cheek the slim rigour of her attitude a rigour beyondthat of her natural being they had silences at last that werealmost crudities of mutual resistance silences that persistedthrough his felt effort to treat her recurrence to the part hehad lately played to interpret all the sweetness of her sotalking to him as a manner of making love to him ah it was nosuch manner heaven knew for maggie she could make love ifthis had been in question better than that on top of which itcame to her presently to say keeping in with what she hadalready spoken except of course that for the question of goingoff somewhere he d go readily quite delightedly with you iverily believe he d like to have you for a while to himself do you mean he thinks of proposing it the prince after amoment sounded oh no he doesn t ask as you must so often have seen but ibelieve he d go like a shot as you say if you were to suggestit it had the air she knew of a kind of condition made and shehad asked herself while she spoke if it wouldn t cause his arm tolet her go the fact that it didn t suggested to her that she hadmade him of a sudden still more intensely think think withsuch concentration that he could do but one thing at once and itwas precisely as if the concentration had the next moment beenproved in him he took a turn inconsistent with the superficialimpression a jump that made light of their approach to gravityand represented for her the need in him to gain time that shemade out was his drawback that the warning from her had come tohim and had come to charlotte after all too suddenly thatthey were in face of it rearranging that they had to rearrange was all before her again yet to do as they would like they mustenjoy a snatch longer or shorter of recovered independence amerigo for the instant was but doing as he didn t like and itwas as if she were watching his effort without disguise what syour father s idea this year then about fawns will he go atwhitsuntide and will he then stay on maggie went through the form of thought he will really do iimagine as he has in so many ways so often done before dowhatever may seem most agreeable to yourself and there s ofcourse always charlotte to be considered only their going earlyto fawns if they do go she said needn t in the least entailyour and my going ah amerigo echoed it needn t in the least entail your and mygoing we can do as we like what they may do needn t trouble us sincethey re by good fortune perfectly happy together oh the prince returned your father s never so happy as withyou near him to enjoy his being so well i may enjoy it said maggie but i m not the cause ofit you re the cause her husband declared of the greater part ofeverything that s good among us but she received this tributein silence and the next moment he pursued if mrs verver hasarrears of time with you to make up as you say she ll scarcelydo it or you scarcely will by our cutting your and my cutting too loose i see what you mean maggie mused he let her for a little to give her attention to it after which shall i just quite of a sudden he asked propose him ajourney maggie hesitated but she brought forth the fruit of reflection it would have the merit that charlotte then would be with me with me i mean so much more also that i shouldn t by choosingsuch a time for going away seem unconscious and ungrateful seemnot to respond seem in fact rather to wish to shake her off ishould respond on the contrary very markedly by being herealone with her for a month and would you like to be here alone with her for a month i could do with it beautifully or we might even she saidquite gaily go together down to fawns you could be so very content without me the prince presentlyinquired yes my own dear if you could be content for a while withfather that would keep me up i might for the time she wenton go to stay there with charlotte or better still she mightcome to portland place oho said the prince with cheerful vagueness i should feel you see she continued that the two of us wereshowing the same sort of kindness amerigo thought the two of us charlotte and i maggie again hesitated you and i darling i see i see he promptly took it in and what reason shall igive give i mean your father for asking him to go off why the very simplest if youconscientiously can the desire said maggie to be agreeableto him just that only something in this reply made her husband again reflect conscientiously why shouldn t i conscientiously it wouldn t by your own contention he developed represent any surprisefor him i must strike him sufficiently as at the worst thelast person in the world to wish to do anything to hurt him ah there it was again for maggie the note already sounded thenote of the felt need of not working harm why this precautionaryview she asked herself afresh when her father had complained at the very least as little as herself with their stillnesstogether so perfect what had suggested so around them theattitude of sparing them her inner vision fixed it once more this attitude saw it in the others as vivid and concrete extended it straight from her companion to charlotte before shewas well aware accordingly she had echoed in this intensity ofthought amerigo s last words you re the last person in theworld to wish to do anything to hurt him she heard herself heard her tone after she had spoken andheard it the more that for a minute after she felt herhusband s eyes on her face very close too close for her to seehim he was looking at her because he was struck and lookinghard though his answer when it came was straight enough why isn t that just what we have been talking about that i veaffected you as fairly studying his comfort and his pleasure hemight show his sense of it the prince went on by proposing tome an excursion and you would go with him maggie immediately asked he hung fire but an instant per dio she also had her pause but she broke it since gaiety was in theair with an intense smile you can say that safely because theproposal s one that of his own motion he won t make she couldn t have narrated afterwards and in fact was at a lossto tell herself by what transition what rather markedabruptness of change in their personal relation their drive cameto its end with a kind of interval established almost confessedto between them she felt it in the tone with which he repeated after her safely safely as regards being thrown with him perhaps after all insuch a case too long he s a person to think you might easilyfeel yourself to be so it won t maggie said come fromfather he s too modest their eyes continued to meet on it from corner to corner of thebrougham oh your modesty between you but he still smiledfor it so that unless i insist we shall simply go on as we are well we re going on beautifully he answered though by nomeans with the effect it would have had if their mutetransaction that of attempted capture and achieved escape hadnot taken place as maggie said nothing none the less togainsay his remark it was open to him to find himself the nextmoment conscious of still another idea i wonder if it would do i mean for me to break in to break in between your father and his wife but there would be a way hesaid we can make charlotte ask him and then as maggie herselfnow wondered echoing it again we can suggest to her to suggestto him that he shall let me take him off oh said maggie then if he asks her why i so suddenly break out she ll be ableto tell him the reason they were stopping and the footman who had alighted had rungat the house door that you think it would be so charming that i think it would be so charming that we ve persuaded herwill be convincing i see maggie went on while the footman came back to let themout i see she said again though she felt a littledisconcerted what she really saw of a sudden was that herstepmother might report her as above all concerned for theproposal and this brought her back her need that her fathershouldn t think her concerned in any degree for anything shealighted the next instant with a slight sense of defeat herhusband to let her out had passed before her and a little inadvance he awaited her on the edge of the low terrace a stephigh that preceded their open entrance on either side of whichone of their servants stood the sense of a life tremendouslyordered and fixed rose before her and there was something inamerigo s very face while his eyes again met her own through thedusky lamplight that was like a conscious reminder of it hehad answered her just before distinctly and it appeared toleave her nothing to say it was almost as if having planned forthe last word she saw him himself enjoying it it was almost asif in the strangest way in the world he were paying her back by the production of a small pang that of a new uneasiness forthe way she had slipped from him during their drive xxviiimaggie s new uneasiness might have had time to drop inasmuch asshe not only was conscious during several days that followed ofno fresh indication for it to feed on but was even struck inquite another way with an augmentation of the symptoms of thatdifference she had taken it into her head to work for sherecognised by the end of a week that if she had been in a mannercaught up her father had been not less so with the effect of herhusband s and his wife s closing in together round them and oftheir all having suddenly begun as a party of four to lead alife gregarious and from that reason almost hilarious so far asthe easy sound of it went as never before it might have been anaccident and a mere coincidence so at least she said to herselfat first but a dozen chances that furthered the whole appearancehad risen to the surface pleasant pretexts oh certainlypleasant as pleasant as amerigo in particular could make them for associated undertakings quite for shared adventures for itsalways turning out amusingly that they wanted to do very muchthe same thing at the same time and in the same way funny allthis was to some extent in the light of the fact that thefather and daughter for so long had expressed so few positivedesires yet it would be sufficiently natural that if amerigo andcharlotte had at last got a little tired of each other s companythey should find their relief not so much in sinking to therather low level of their companions as in wishing to pull thelatter into the train in which they so constantly moved we rein the train maggie mutely reflected after the dinner in eatonsquare with lady castledean we ve suddenly waked up in it andfound ourselves rushing along very much as if we had been put induring sleep shoved like a pair of labelled boxes into thevan and since i wanted to go i m certainly going she mighthave added i m moving without trouble they re doing it all forus it s wonderful how they understand and how perfectly itsucceeds for that was the thing she had most immediately toacknowledge it seemed as easy for them to make a quartette as ithad formerly so long appeared for them to make a pair ofcouples this latter being thus a discovery too absurdly belated the only point at which day after day the success appeared atall qualified was represented as might have been said by herirresistible impulse to give her father a clutch when the trainindulged in one of its occasional lurches then there was nodenying it his eyes and her own met so that they werethemselves doing active violence as against the others to thatvery spirit of union or at least to that very achievement ofchange which she had taken the field to invoke the maximum of change was reached no doubt the day the matchamparty dined in portland place the day really perhaps ofmaggie s maximum of social glory in the sense of its showing forher own occasion her very own with every one else extravagantlyrallying and falling in absolutely conspiring to make her itsheroine it was as if her father himself always with moreinitiative as a guest than as a host had dabbled too in theconspiracy and the impression was not diminished by the presenceof the assinghams likewise very much caught up now aftersomething of a lull by the side wind of all the rest of themotion and giving our young woman so far at least as fanny wasconcerned the sense of some special intention of encouragementand applause fanny who had not been present at the otherdinner thanks to a preference entertained and expressed bycharlotte made a splendid show at this one in neworange coloured velvet with multiplied turquoises and with aconfidence furthermore as different as possible her hostessinferred from her too marked betrayal of a belittled state atmatcham maggie was not indifferent to her own opportunity toredress this balance which seemed for the hour part of ageneral rectification she liked making out for herself that onthe high level of portland place a spot exempt on all sorts ofgrounds from jealous jurisdictions her friend could feel as good as any one and could in fact at moments almost appear totake the lead in recognition and celebration so far as theevening might conduce to intensify the lustre of the littleprincess mrs assingham produced on her the impression of givingher constantly her cue for this and it was in truth partly byher help intelligently quite gratefully accepted that thelittle princess in maggie was drawn out and emphasised shecouldn t definitely have said how it happened but she feltherself for the first time in her career living up to thepublic and popular notion of such a personage as it pressed uponher from all round rather wondering inwardly too while she didso at that strange mixture in things through which the popularnotion could be evidenced for her by such supposedly great onesof the earth as the castledeans and their kind fanny assinghammight really have been there at all events like one of theassistants in the ring at the circus to keep up the pace of thesleek revolving animal on whose back the lady in short spangledskirts should brilliantly caper and posture that was all doubtless maggie had forgotten had neglected had declined tobe the little princess on anything like the scale open to her but now that the collective hand had been held out to her withsuch alacrity so that she might skip up into the light even asseemed to her modest mind with such a show of pink stocking andsuch an abbreviation of white petticoat she could strike herselfas perceiving under arched eyebrows where her mistake had been she had invited for the later hours after her dinner a freshcontingent the whole list of her apparent london acquaintance which was again a thing in the manner of little princesses forwhom the princely art was a matter of course that was what shewas learning to do to fill out as a matter of course herappointed her expected her imposed character and though therewere latent considerations that somewhat interfered with thelesson she was having to night an inordinate quantity ofpractice none of it so successful as when quite wittingly shedirected it at lady castledean who was reduced by it at last toan unprecedented state of passivity the perception of this highresult caused mrs assingham fairly to flush with responsive joy she glittered at her young friend from moment to moment quitefeverishly it was positively as if her young friend had in somemarvellous sudden supersubtle way become a source of succourto herself become beautifully divinely retributive theintensity of the taste of these registered phenomena was in factthat somehow by a process and through a connexion not again tobe traced she so practised at the same time on amerigo andcharlotte with only the drawback her constant check andsecond thought that she concomitantly practised perhaps stillmore on her father this last was a danger indeed that for much of the ensuing time had its hours of strange beguilement those at which her sensefor precautions so suffered itself to lapse that she felt hercommunion with him more intimate than any other it couldn t butpass between them that something singular was happening so muchas this she again and again said to herself whereby the comfortof it was there after all to be noted just as much as thepossible peril and she could think of the couple they formedtogether as groping with sealed lips but with mutual looks thathad never been so tender for some freedom some fiction somefigured bravery under which they might safely talk of it themoment was to come and it finally came with an effect aspenetrating as the sound that follows the pressure of an electricbutton when she read the least helpful of meanings into theagitation she had created the merely specious description oftheir case would have been that after being for a long time asa family delightfully uninterruptedly happy they had still hada new felicity to discover a felicity for which blessedly herfather s appetite and her own in particular had been kept freshand grateful this livelier march of their intercourse as a wholewas the thing that occasionally determined in him the clutchinginstinct we have glanced at very much as if he had said to her in default of her breaking silence first everything isremarkably pleasant isn t it but where for it after all arewe up in a balloon and whirling through space or down in thedepths of the earth in the glimmering passages of a gold mine the equilibrium the precious condition lasted in spite ofrearrangement there had been a fresh distribution of thedifferent weights but the balance persisted and triumphed allof which was just the reason why she was forbidden face to facewith the companion of her adventure the experiment of a test ifthey balanced they balanced she had to take that it deprivedher of every pretext for arriving by however covert a process at what he thought but she had her hours thus of feeling supremely linked to himby the rigour of their law and when it came over her that allthe while the wish on his side to spare her might be what mostworked with him this very fact of their seeming to have nothing inward really to talk about wrapped him up for her in a kind ofsweetness that was wanting as a consecration even in heryearning for her husband she was powerless however was onlymore utterly hushed when the interrupting flash came when shewould have been all ready to say to him yes this is by everyappearance the best time we ve had yet but don t you see allthe same how they must be working together for it and how myvery success my success in shifting our beautiful harmony to anew basis comes round to being their success above all theircleverness their amiability their power to hold out theircomplete possession in short of our life for how could shesay as much as that without saying a great deal more withoutsaying they ll do everything in the world that suits us saveonly one thing prescribe a line for us that will make themseparate how could she so much as imagine herself even faintlymurmuring that without putting into his mouth the very words thatwould have made her quail separate my dear do you want themto separate then you want us to you and me for how can the oneseparation take place without the other that was the questionthat in spirit she had heard him ask with its dread train moreover of involved and connected inquiries their ownseparation his and hers was of course perfectly thinkable butonly on the basis of the sharpest of reasons well the sharpest the very sharpest would be that they could no longer afford asit were he to let his wife she to let her husband run themin such compact formation and say they accepted this account oftheir situation as a practical finality acting upon it andproceeding to a division would no sombre ghosts of the smotheredpast on either side show across the widening strait paleunappeased faces or raise in the very passage deprecating denouncing hands meanwhile however such things might be she was to have occasionto say to herself that there might be but a deeper treachery inrecoveries and reassurances she was to feel alone again as shehad felt at the issue of her high tension with her husband duringtheir return from meeting the castledeans in eaton square theevening in question had left her with a larger alarm but then alull had come the alarm after all was yet to be confirmed there came an hour inevitably when she knew with a chill whatshe had feared and why it had taken this hour a month toarrive but to find it before her was thoroughly to recognise it for it showed her sharply what amerigo had meant in alluding to aparticular use that they might make for their reaffirmed harmonyand prosperity of charlotte the more she thought at present of the tone he had employed to express their enjoyment of thisresource the more it came back to her as the product of aconscious art of dealing with her he had been conscious at themoment of many things conscious even not a little ofdesiring and thereby of needing to see what she would do in agiven case the given case would be that of her being to acertain extent as she might fairly make it out menaced horrible as it was to impute to him any intention represented by such a word why it was that to speak of making her stepmotherintervene as they might call it in a question that seemed justthen and there quite peculiarly their own business why it wasthat a turn so familiar and so easy should at the worst strikeher as charged with the spirit of a threat was an odditydisconnected for her temporarily from its grounds theadventure of an imagination within her that possibly had lost itsway that precisely was doubtless why she had learned to wait as the weeks passed by with a fair or rather indeed with anexcessive imitation of resumed serenity there had been noprompt sequel to the prince s equivocal light and that made forpatience yet she was none the less to have to admit afterdelay that the bread he had cast on the waters had come home and that she should thus be justified of her old apprehension the consequence of this in turn was a renewed pang in presenceof his remembered ingenuity to be ingenious with her whatdidn t what mightn t that mean when she had so absolutelynever at any point of contact with him put him by as much asthe value of a penny to the expense of sparing doubting fearing her of having in any way whatever to reckon with her the ingenuity had been in his simply speaking of their use ofcharlotte as if it were common to them in an equal degree andhis triumph on the occasion had been just in the simplicity she couldn t and he knew it say what was true oh you use her and i use her if you will yes but we use her ever sodifferently and separately not at all in the same way or degree there s nobody we really use together but ourselves don t yousee by which i mean that where our interests are the same i canso beautifully so exquisitely serve you for everything and youcan so beautifully so exquisitely serve me the only personeither of us needs is the other of us so why as a matter ofcourse in such a case as this drag in charlotte she couldn t so challenge him because it would have been andthere she was paralysed the note it would have translateditself on the spot for his ear into jealousy and fromreverberation to repercussion would have reached her father sexactly in the form of a cry piercing the stillness of peacefulsleep it had been for many days almost as difficult for her tocatch a quiet twenty minutes with her father as it had formerlybeen easy there had been in fact of old the time sostrangely seemed already far away an inevitability in herlonger passages with him a sort of domesticated beauty in thecalculability round about them of everything but at presentcharlotte was almost always there when amerigo brought her toeaton square where amerigo was constantly bringing her andamerigo was almost always there when charlotte brought herhusband to portland place where charlotte was constantlybringing him the fractions of occasions the chance minutes thatput them face to face had as yet of late contrived to countbut little between them either for the sense of opportunity orfor that of exposure inasmuch as the lifelong rhythm of theirintercourse made against all cursory handling of deep things they had never availed themselves of any given quarter of an hourto gossip about fundamentals they moved slowly through largestill spaces they could be silent together at any time beautifully with much more comfort than hurriedly expressive itappeared indeed to have become true that their common appealmeasured itself for vividness just by this economy of sound they might have been talking at each other when they talkedwith their companions but these latter assuredly were not inany directer way to gain light on the current phase of theirrelation such were some of the reasons for which maggiesuspected fundamentals as i have called them to be rising by anew movement to the surface suspected it one morning late inmay when her father presented himself in portland place alone he had his pretext of that she was fully aware the principino two days before had shown signs happily not persistent of afeverish cold and had notoriously been obliged to spend theinterval at home this was ground ample ground for punctualinquiry but what it wasn t ground for she quickly found herselfreflecting was his having managed in the interest of his visit to dispense so unwontedly as their life had recently come to bearranged with his wife s attendance it had so happened that sheherself was for the hour exempt from her husband s and it willat once be seen that the hour had a quality all its own when inote that remembering how the prince had looked in to say he wasgoing out the princess whimsically wondered if their respectivesposi mightn t frankly be meeting whimsically hoped indeed theywere temporarily so disposed of strange was her need atmoments to think of them as not attaching an excessiveimportance to their repudiation of the general practice that hadrested only a few weeks before on such a consecrated rightness repudiations surely were not in the air they had none of themcome to that for wasn t she at this minute testifying directlyagainst them by her own behaviour when she should confess tofear of being alone with her father to fear of what he mightthen ah with such a slow painful motion as she had a horrorof say to her then would be time enough for amerigo andcharlotte to confess to not liking to appear to foregather she had this morning a wonderful consciousness both of dreading aparticular question from him and of being able to check yes evento disconcert magnificently by her apparent manner of receivingit any restless imagination he might have about its importance the day bright and soft had the breath of summer it made themtalk to begin with of fawns of the way fawns invited maggieaware the while that in thus regarding with him the sweetnessof its invitation to one couple just as much as to another herhumbugging smile grew very nearly convulsive that was it andthere was relief truly of a sort in taking it in she washumbugging him already by absolute necessity as she had never never done in her life doing it up to the full height of whatshe had allowed for the necessity in the great dimly shiningroom where declining for his reasons to sit down he movedabout in amerigo s very footsteps the necessity affected her aspressing upon her with the very force of the charm itself of theold pleasantness between them so candidly playing up thereagain of the positive flatness of their tenderness a surfaceall for familiar use quite as if generalised from the longsuccession of tapestried sofas sweetly faded on which histheory of contentment had sat through unmeasured pauses besideher own she knew from this instant knew in advance and as wellas anything would ever teach her that she must never intermitfor a solitary second her so highly undertaking to prove thatthere was nothing the matter with her she saw of a sudden everything she might say or do in the light of that undertaking established connections from it with any number of remotematters struck herself for instance as acting all in itsinterest when she proposed their going out in the exercise oftheir freedom and in homage to the season for a turn in theregent s park this resort was close at hand at the top ofportland place and the principino beautifully better hadalready proceeded there under high attendance all of whichconsiderations were defensive for maggie all of which became toher mind part of the business of cultivating continuity upstairs while she left him to put on something to go out in the thought of his waiting below for her in possession of theempty house brought with it sharply if briefly one of herabrupt arrests of consistency the brush of a vain imaginationalmost paralysing her often for the minute before her glass the vivid look in other words of the particular differencehis marriage had made the particular difference seemed at suchinstants the loss more than anything else of their old freedom their never having had to think where they were togetherconcerned of any one of anything but each other it hadn t beenher marriage that did it that had never for three seconds suggested to either of them that they must act diplomatically must reckon with another presence no not even with herhusband s she groaned to herself while the vain imaginationlasted why did he marry ah why did he and then it came upto her more than ever that nothing could have been more beautifulthan the way in which till charlotte came so much more closelyinto their life amerigo hadn t interfered what she had gone onowing him for this mounted up again to her eyes like a columnof figures or call it even if one would a house of cards itwas her father s wonderful act that had tipped the house down andmade the sum wrong with all of which immediately after herquestion her why did he why did he rushed back inevitably the confounding the overwhelming wave of the knowledge of hisreason he did it for me he did it for me she moaned he didit exactly that our freedom meaning beloved man simply andsolely mine should be greater instead of less he did it divinely to liberate me so far as possible from caring whatbecame of him she found time upstairs even in her haste asshe had repeatedly found time before to let the wondermentsinvolved in these recognitions flash at her with their customaryeffect of making her blink the question in especial of whethershe might find her solution in acting herself in the spirit ofwhat he had done in forcing her care really to grow as muchless as he had tried to make it thus she felt the whole weightof their case drop afresh upon her shoulders was confronted unmistakably with the prime source of her haunted state it allcame from her not having been able not to mind not to mind whatbecame of him not having been able without anxiety to let himgo his way and take his risk and lead his life she had madeanxiety her stupid little idol and absolutely now while shestuck a long pin a trifle fallaciously into her hat she had with an approach to irritation told her maid a new woman whomshe had lately found herself thinking of as abysmal that shedidn t want her she tried to focus the possibility of someunderstanding between them in consequence of which he should cutloose very near indeed it looked any such possibility thatconsciousness too had taken its turn by the time she was ready all the vibration all the emotion of this present passage being precisely in the very sweetness of their lapse back into theconditions of the simpler time into a queer resemblance betweenthe aspect and the feeling of the moment and those of numberlessother moments that were sufficiently far away she had been quickin her preparation in spite of the flow of the tide thatsometimes took away her breath but a pause once more was stillleft for her to make a pause at the top of the stairs beforeshe came down to him in the span of which she asked herself ifit weren t thinkable from the perfectly practical point of view that she should simply sacrifice him she didn t go into thedetail of what sacrificing him would mean she didn t need to sodistinct was it in one of her restless lights that there he wasawaiting her that she should find him walking up and down thedrawing room in the warm fragrant air to which the open windowsand the abundant flowers contributed slowly and vaguely movingthere and looking very slight and young and superficially manageable almost as much like her child putting it a littlefreely as like her parent with the appearance about him aboveall of having perhaps arrived just on purpose to say it to her himself in so many words sacrifice me my own love dosacrifice me do sacrifice me should she want to should sheinsist on it she might verily hear him bleating it at her allconscious and all accommodating like some precious spotless exceptionally intelligent lamb the positive effect of theintensity of this figure however was to make her shake it awayin her resumed descent and after she had rejoined him after shehad picked him up she was to know the full pang of the thoughtthat her impossibility was made absolutely by hisconsciousness by the lucidity of his intention this she feltwhile she smiled there for him again all hypocritically whileshe drew on fair fresh gloves while she interrupted the processfirst to give his necktie a slightly smarter twist and then tomake up to him for her hidden madness by rubbing her nose intohis cheek according to the tradition of their frankest levity from the instant she should be able to convict him of intending every issue would be closed and her hypocrisy would have toredouble the only way to sacrifice him would be to do so withouthis dreaming what it might be for she kissed him she arrangedhis cravat she dropped remarks she guided him out she held hisarm not to be led but to lead him and taking it to her by muchthe same intimate pressure she had always used when a littlegirl to mark the inseparability of her doll she did all thesethings so that he should sufficiently fail to dream of what theymight be for xxixthere was nothing to show that her effort in any degree fellshort till they got well into the park and he struck her asgiving unexpectedly the go by to any serious search for theprincipino the way they sat down awhile in the sun was a sign ofthat his dropping with her into the first pair of sequesteredchairs they came across and waiting a little after they wereplaced as if now at last she might bring out as between them something more specific it made her but feel the more sharplyhow the specific in almost any direction was utterly forbiddenher how the use of it would be for all the world like undoingthe leash of a dog eager to follow up a scent it would come out the specific where the dog would come out would run to earth somehow the truth for she was believing herself in relation tothe truth at which she mustn t so much as indirectly point such at any rate was the fashion in which her passionateprudence played over possibilities of danger reading symptomsand betrayals into everything she looked at and yet having tomake it evident while she recognised them that she didn twince there were moments between them in their chairs when hemight have been watching her guard herself and trying to think ofsomething new that would trip her up there were pauses duringwhich with her affection as sweet and still as the sunshine shemight yet as at some hard game over a table for money havebeen defying him to fasten upon her the least little complicationof consciousness she was positively proud afterwards of thegreat style in which she had kept this up later on at thehour s end when they had retraced their steps to find amerigoand charlotte awaiting them at the house she was able to say toherself that truly she had put her plan through even thoughonce more setting herself the difficult task of making theirrelation every minute of the time not fall below the standardof that other hour in the treasured past which hung therebehind them like a framed picture in a museum a high watermarkfor the history of their old fortune the summer evening in thepark at fawns when side by side under the trees just as now they had let their happy confidence lull them with its mostgolden tone there had been the possibility of a trap for her atpresent in the very question of their taking up anew thatresidence wherefore she had not been the first to sound it inspite of the impression from him of his holding off to see whatshe would do she was saying to herself in secret can we again in this form migrate there can i for myself undertake it face all the intenser keeping up and stretching out indefinitely impossibly that our conditions in the country aswe ve established and accepted them would stand for she hadpositively lost herself in this inward doubt so much she wassubsequently to remember but remembering then too that hercompanion though perceptibly perhaps as if not to be eager hadbroken the ice very much as he had broken it in eaton squareafter the banquet to the castledeans her mind had taken a long excursion wandered far into the visionof what a summer at fawns with amerigo and charlotte still moreeminently in presence against that higher sky would bring forth wasn t her father meanwhile only pretending to talk of it justas she was in a manner pretending to listen he got off it finally at all events for the transition it couldn t well helpthrusting out at him it had amounted exactly to an arrest of herprivate excursion by the sense that he had begun to imitate oh as never yet the ancient tone of gold it had verily come fromhim at last the question of whether she thought it would be verygood but very good indeed that he should leave england for aseries of weeks on some pretext with the prince then it hadbeen that she was to know her husband s menace hadn t reallydropped since she was face to face with the effect of it ah the effect of it had occupied all the rest of their walk hadstayed out with them and come home with them besides making itimpossible that they shouldn t presently feign to recollect howrejoining the child had been their original purpose maggie suneffaced note was that it had at the end of five minutes more driven them to that endeavour as to a refuge and caused themafterwards to rejoice as well that the boy s irrepressiblyimportunate company in due course secured and enjoyed with theextension imparted by his governess a person expectant ofconsideration constituted a cover for any awkwardness for thatwas what it had all come to that the dear man had spoken to herto try her quite as he had been spoken to himself by charlotte with the same fine idea the princess took it in on the spot firmly grasping it she heard them together her father and hiswife dealing with the queer case the prince tells me thatmaggie has a plan for your taking some foreign journey with him and as he likes to do everything she wants he has suggested myspeaking to you for it as the thing most likely to make youconsent so i do speak see being always so eager myself asyou know to meet maggie s wishes i speak but without quiteunderstanding this time what she has in her head why shouldshe of a sudden at this particular moment desire to ship youoff together and to remain here alone with me the compliment sall to me i admit and you must decide quite as you like theprince is quite ready evidently to do his part but you ll haveit out with him that is you ll have it out with her somethingof that kind was what in her mind s ear maggie heard and this after his waiting for her to appeal to him directly was herfather s invitation to her to have it out well as she could sayto herself all the rest of the day that was what they did whilethey continued to sit there in their penny chairs that was whatthey had done as much as they would now ever ever have outanything the measure of this at least had been given thateach would fight to the last for the protection for theperversion of any real anxiety she had confessed instantly with her humbugging grin not flinching by a hair meeting hiseyes as mildly as he met hers she had confessed to her fancythat they might both he and his son in law have welcomed suchan escapade since they had both been so long so furiouslydomestic she had almost cocked her hat under the inspiration ofthis opportunity to hint how a couple of spirited young men reacting from confinement and sallying forth arm in arm mightencounter the agreeable in forms that would strike them for thetime at least as novel she had felt for fifty seconds with hereyes all so sweetly and falsely in her companion s horriblyvulgar yet without minding it either such luck should she haveif to be nothing worse than vulgar would see her through and ithought amerigo might like it better she had said thanwandering off alone do you mean that he won t go unless i take him she had considered here and never in her life had she consideredso promptly and so intently if she really put it that way herhusband challenged might belie the statement so that whatwould that do but make her father wonder make him perhaps askstraight out why she was exerting pressure she couldn t ofcourse afford to be suspected for an instant of exertingpressure which was why she was obliged only to make answer wouldn t that be just what you must have out with him decidedly if he makes me the proposal but he hasn t made ityet oh once more how she was to feel she had smirked perhaps he stoo shy because you re so sure he so really wants my company i think he has thought you might like it well i should but with this he looked away from her andshe held her breath to hear him either ask if she wished him toaddress the question to amerigo straight or inquire if sheshould be greatly disappointed by his letting it drop what had settled her as she was privately to call it was that he haddone neither of these things and had thereby markedly stood offfrom the risk involved in trying to draw out her reason toattenuate on the other hand this appearance and quite as if tofill out the too large receptacle made so musingly by hisabstention he had himself presently given her a reason hadpositively spared her the effort of asking whether he judgedcharlotte not to have approved he had taken everything onhimself that was what had settled her she had had to wait verylittle more to feel with this how much he was taking the pointhe made was his lack of any eagerness to put time and space onany such scale between himself and his wife he wasn t sounhappy with her far from it and maggie was to hold that he hadgrinned back paternally through his rather shielding glasses in easy emphasis of this as to be able to hint that he requiredthe relief of absence therefore unless it was for the princehimself oh i don t think it would have been for amerigo himself amerigo and i maggie had said perfectly rub on together well then there we are i see and she had again with sublime blandness assented there we are charlotte and i too her father had gaily proceeded perfectlyrub on together and then he had appeared for a little to bemaking time to put it only so he had mildly and happilyadded to put it only so he had spoken as if he might easilyput it much better yet as if the humour of contentedunderstatement fairly sufficed for the occasion he had playedthen either all consciously or all unconsciously intocharlotte s hands and the effect of this was to render treblyoppressive maggie s conviction of charlotte s plan she had donewhat she wanted his wife had which was also what amerigo hadmade her do she had kept her test maggie s test from becomingpossible and had applied instead a test of her own it wasexactly as if she had known that her stepdaughter would be afraidto be summoned to say under the least approach tocross examination why any change was desirable and it was forour young woman herself still more prodigiously as if herfather had been capable of calculations to match of judging itimportant he shouldn t be brought to demand of her what was thematter with her why otherwise with such an opportunity hadn the demanded it always from calculation that was why that waswhy he was terrified of the retort he might have invoked what my dear if you come to that is the matter with you when aminute later on he had followed up his last note by a touch ortwo designed still further to conjure away the ghost of theanomalous at that climax verily she would have had to be dumb tothe question there seems a kind of charm doesn t there on ourlife and quite as if just lately it had got itself somehowrenewed had waked up refreshed a kind of wicked selfishprosperity perhaps as if we had grabbed everything fixedeverything down to the last lovely object for the last glasscase of the last corner left over of my old show that s theonly take off that it has made us perhaps lazy a wee bitlanguid lying like gods together all careless of mankind do you consider that we re languid that form of rejoinder shehad jumped at for the sake of its pretty lightness do youconsider that we are careless of mankind living as we do in thebiggest crowd in the world and running about always pursued andpursuing it had made him think indeed a little longer than she had meant but he came up again as she might have said smiling well idon t know we get nothing but the fun do we no she had hastened to declare we certainly get nothing butthe fun we do it all he had remarked so beautifully we do it all so beautifully she hadn t denied this for amoment i see what you mean well i mean too he had gone on that we haven t no doubt enough the sense of difficulty enough enough for what enough not to be selfish i don t think you are selfish she had returned and hadmanaged not to wail it i don t say that it s me particularly or that it s you orcharlotte or amerigo but we re selfish together we move as aselfish mass you see we want always the same thing he had goneon and that holds us that binds us together we want eachother he had further explained only wanting it each time for each other that s what i call the happy spell but it salso a little possibly the immorality the immorality she had pleasantly echoed well we re tremendously moral for ourselves that is for eachother and i won t pretend that i know exactly at whoseparticular personal expense you and i for instance are happy what it comes to i daresay is that there s something haunting as if it were a bit uncanny in such a consciousness of ourgeneral comfort and privilege unless indeed he had rambled on it s only i to whom fantastically it says so much that s alli mean at any rate that it s sort of soothing as if we weresitting about on divans with pigtails smoking opium and seeingvisions let us then be up and doing what is it longfellowsays that seems sometimes to ring out like the police breakingin into our opium den to give us a shake but the beauty of itis at the same time that we are doing we re doing that is after all what we went in for we re working it our life ourchance whatever you may call it as we saw it as we felt it from the first we have worked it and what more can you do thanthat it s a good deal for me he had wound up to have madecharlotte so happy to have so perfectly contented her you froma good way back were a matter of course i mean your being allright so that i needn t mind your knowing that my greatinterest since then has rather inevitably been in making sureof the same success very much to your advantage as well forcharlotte if we ve worked our life our idea really as i say if at any rate i can sit here and say that i ve worked my shareof it it has not been what you may call least by our having putcharlotte so at her ease that has been soothing all round thathas curled up as the biggest of the blue fumes or whatever theyare of the opium don t you see what a cropper we would havecome if she hadn t settled down as she has and he had concludedby turning to maggie as for something she mightn t really havethought of you darling in that case i verily believe wouldhave been the one to hate it most to hate it maggie had wondered to hate our having with our tremendous intentions not broughtit off and i daresay i should have hated it for you even morethan for myself that s not unlikely perhaps when it was for me after all thatyou did it he had hesitated but only a moment i never told you so well charlotte herself soon enough told me but i never told her her father had answered are you very sure she had presently asked well i like to think how thoroughly i was taken with her andhow right i was and how fortunate to have that for my basis itold her all the good i thought of her then that maggie had returned was precisely part of thegood i mean it was precisely part of it that she could sobeautifully understand yes understand everything everything and in particular your reasons her telling me thatshowed me how she had understood they were face to face again now and she saw she had made hiscolour rise it was as if he were still finding in her eyes theconcrete image the enacted scene of her passage with charlotte which he was now hearing of for the first time and as to which itwould have been natural he should question her further hisforbearance to do so would but mark precisely the complicationof his fears what she does like he finally said is the wayit has succeeded your marriage yes my whole idea the way i ve been justified that s the joyi give her if for her either it had failed that however was not worth talking about he had broken off you think thenyou could now risk fawns risk it well morally from the point of view i was talking of that ofour sinking deeper into sloth our selfishness somehow seems atits biggest down there maggie had allowed him the amusement of her not taking this up is charlotte she had simply asked really ready oh if you and i and amerigo are whenever one cornerscharlotte he had developed more at his ease one finds thatshe only wants to know what we want which is what we got herfor what we got her for exactly and so for a little even thoughwith a certain effect of oddity in their more or less successfulease they left it left it till maggie made the remark that itwas all the same wonderful her stepmother should be willing before the season was out to exchange so much company for somuch comparative solitude ah he had then made answer that s because her idea i think this time is that we shall have more people more than we vehitherto had in the country don t you remember that that originally was what we were to get her for oh yes to give us a life maggie had gone through the form ofrecalling this and the light of their ancient candour shiningfrom so far back had seemed to bring out some things sostrangely that with the sharpness of the vision she had risento her feet well with a life fawns will certainly do hehad remained in his place while she looked over his head thepicture in her vision had suddenly swarmed the vibration wasthat of one of the lurches of the mystic train in which with hercompanion she was travelling but she was having to steadyherself this time before meeting his eyes she had measuredindeed the full difference between the move to fawns because eachof them now knew the others wanted it and the pairing off for ajourney of her husband and her father which nobody knew thateither wanted more company at fawns would be effectuallyenough the key in which her husband and her stepmother were atwork there was truly no question but that she and her fathermust accept any array of visitors no one could try to marry himnow what he had just said was a direct plea for that and whatwas the plea itself but an act of submission to charlotte hehad from his chair been noting her look but he had the nextminute also risen and then it was they had reminded each otherof their having come out for the boy their junction with him andwith his companion successfully effected the four had moved homemore slowly and still more vaguely yet with a vagueness thatpermitted of maggie s reverting an instant to the larger issue if we have people in the country then as you were saying doyou know for whom my first fancy would be you may be amused butit would be for the castledeans i see but why should i be amused well i mean i am myself i don t think i like her and yet ilike to see her which as amerigo says is rum but don t you feel she s very handsome her father inquired yes but it isn t for that then what is it for simply that she may be there just there before us it s as ifshe may have a value as if something may come of her i don t inthe least know what and she rather irritates me meanwhile idon t even know i admit why but if we see her often enough imay find out does it matter so very much her companion had asked while theymoved together she had hesitated you mean because you do rather like her he on his side too had waited a little but then he had taken itfrom her yes i guess i do rather like her which she accepted for the first case she could recall of theirnot being affected by a person in the same way it came backtherefore to his pretending but she had gone far enough and toadd to her appearance of levity she further observed that thoughthey were so far from a novelty she should also immediatelydesire at fawns the presence of the assinghams that puteverything on a basis independent of explanations yet it wasextraordinary at the same time how much once in the countryagain with the others she was going as they used to say athome to need the presence of the good fanny it was thestrangest thing in the world but it was as if mrs assinghammight in a manner mitigate the intensity of her consciousness ofcharlotte it was as if the two would balance one against theother as if it came round again in that fashion to her idea ofthe equilibrium it would be like putting this friend into herscale to make weight into the scale with her father and herself amerigo and charlotte would be in the other therefore it wouldtake the three of them to keep that one straight and as thisplayed all duskily in her mind it had received from her father with a sound of suddenness a luminous contribution ah rather do let s have the assinghams it would be to have them she had said as we used so much tohave them for a good long stay in the old way and on the oldterms as regular boarders fanny used to call it that is ifthey ll come as regular boarders on the old terms that s what i should liketoo but i guess they ll come her companion had added in a toneinto which she had read meanings the main meaning was that hefelt he was going to require them quite as much as she was hisrecognition of the new terms as different from the old what wasthat practically but a confession that something had happened and a perception that interested in the situation she had helpedto create mrs assingham would be by so much as this concerned in its inevitable development it amounted to anintimation off his guard that he should be thankful for someone to turn to if she had wished covertly to sound him he hadnow in short quite given himself away and if she had even atthe start needed anything more to settle her here assuredly wasenough he had hold of his small grandchild as they retracedtheir steps swinging the boy s hand and not bored as he neverwas by his always bristling like a fat little porcupine withshrill interrogation points so that secretly while they went she had wondered again if the equilibrium mightn t have been morereal mightn t above all have demanded less strange a study hadit only been on the books that charlotte should give him aprincipino of his own she had repossessed herself now of hisother arm only this time she was drawing him back gently helplessly back to what they had tried for the hour to getaway from just as he was consciously drawing the child and ashigh miss bogle on her left representing the duties of home wascomplacently drawing her the duties of home when the house inportland place reappeared showed even from a distance asvividly there before them amerigo and charlotte had come in that is amerigo had charlotte rather having come out and thepair were perched together in the balcony he bare headed shedivested of her jacket her mantle or whatever but crowned witha brilliant brave hat responsive to the balmy day which maggieimmediately spotted as new as insuperably original as worn in characteristic generous harmony for the first time all evidently to watch for the return of the absent to be there totake them over again as punctually as possible they were gay they were amused in the pleasant morning they leaned across therail and called down their greeting lighting up the front of thegreat black house with an expression that quite broke themonotony that might almost have shocked the decency of portlandplace the group on the pavement stared up as at the peopledbattlements of a castle even miss bogle who carried her headmost aloft gaped a little through the interval of space astoward truly superior beings there could scarce have been somuch of the open mouth since the dingy waits on christmas eve had so lamentably chanted for pennies the time when amerigo insatiable for english customs had come out with a gasped santissima vergine to marvel at the depositaries of thistradition and purchase a reprieve maggie s individual gape wasinevitably again for the thought of how the pair would be atwork xxxshe had not again for weeks had mrs assingham so effectuallyin presence as on the afternoon of that lady s return from theeaster party at matcham but the intermission was made up as soonas the date of the migration to fawns that of the more or lesssimultaneous adjournment of the two houses began to bediscussed it had struck her promptly that this renewal withan old friend of the old terms she had talked of with herfather was the one opening for her spirit that wouldn t toomuch advertise or betray her even her father who had always ashe would have said believed in their ancient ally wouldn tnecessarily suspect her of invoking fanny s aid toward anyspecial inquiry and least of all if fanny would only act asfanny so easily might maggie s measure of fanny s ease wouldhave been agitating to mrs assingham had it been all at oncerevealed to her as for that matter it was soon destined tobecome even on a comparatively graduated showing our youngwoman s idea in particular was that her safety her escape frombeing herself suspected of suspicion would proceed from thisfriend s power to cover to protect and as might be evenshowily to represent her represent that is her relation to theform of the life they were all actually leading this woulddoubtless be as people said a large order but that mrs assingham existed substantially or could somehow be madeprevailingly to exist for her private benefit was the finestflower maggie had plucked from among the suggestions sown likeabundant seed on the occasion of the entertainment offered inportland place to the matcham company mrs assingham thatnight rebounding from dejection had bristled with bravery andsympathy she had then absolutely she had perhaps recklessly for herself betrayed the deeper and darker consciousness animpression it would now be late for her inconsistently to attemptto undo it was with a wonderful air of giving out all thesetruths that the princess at present approached her again makingdoubtless at first a sufficient scruple of letting her know whatin especial she asked of her yet not a bit ashamed as she infact quite expressly declared of fanny s discerned foreboding ofthe strange uses she might perhaps have for her quite from thefirst really maggie said extraordinary things to her such as you can help me you know my dear when nobody else can suchas i almost wish upon my word that you had something thematter with you that you had lost your health or your money oryour reputation forgive me love so that i might be with youas much as i want or keep you with me without exciting comment without exciting any other remark than that such kindnesses are like me we have each our own way of making up for ourunselfishness and maggie who had no small self at all asagainst her husband or her father and only a weak and uncertainone as against her stepmother would verily at this crisis haveseen mrs assingham s personal life or liberty sacrificed withouta pang the attitude that the appetite in question maintained in her wasto draw peculiar support moreover from the current aspects andagitations of her victim this personage struck her in truth asready for almost anything as not perhaps effusively protesting yet as wanting with a restlessness of her own to know what shewanted and in the long run which was none so long either therewas to be no difficulty as happened about that it was as if for all the world maggie had let her see that she held her thatshe made her fairly responsible for something not to beginwith dotting all the i s nor hooking together all the links buttreating her without insistence rather with caressingconfidence as there to see and to know to advise and to assist the theory visibly had patched itself together for her that thedear woman had somehow from the early time had a hand in alltheir fortunes so that there was no turn of their commonrelations and affairs that couldn t be traced back in some degreeto her original affectionate interest on this affectionateinterest the good lady s young friend now built before her eyes very much as a wise or even as a mischievous child playingon the floor might pile up blocks skilfully and dizzily withan eye on the face of a covertly watching elder when the blocks tumbled down they but acted after the nature ofblocks yet the hour would come for their rising so high that thestructure would have to be noticed and admired mrs assingham sappearance of unreservedly giving herself involved meanwhile onher own side no separate recognitions her face of almostanxious attention was directed altogether to her young friend sso vivid felicity it suggested that she took for granted at themost certain vague recent enhancements of that state if theprincess now more than before was going and going she wasprompt to publish that she beheld her go that she had alwaysknown she would sooner or later and that any appeal forparticipation must more or less contain and invite the note oftriumph there was a blankness in her blandness assuredly andvery nearly an extravagance in her generalising gaiety aprecipitation of cheer particularly marked whenever they metagain after short separations meetings during the first flush ofwhich maggie sometimes felt reminded of other looks in otherfaces of two strangely unobliterated impressions above all thephysiognomic light that had played out in her husband at theshock she had come at last to talk to herself of the shock ofhis first vision of her on his return from matcham andgloucester and the wonder of charlotte s beautiful bold waveringgaze when the next morning in eaton square this old friend hadturned from the window to begin to deal with her if she had dared to think of it so crudely she would have saidthat fanny was afraid of her afraid of something she might sayor do even as for their few brief seconds amerigo andcharlotte had been which made exactly an expressive elementcommon to the three the difference however was that this lookhad in the dear woman its oddity of a constant renewal whereasit had never for the least little instant again peeped out of theothers other looks other lights radiant and steady with theothers had taken its place reaching a climax so short a timeago that morning of the appearance of the pair on the balcony ofher house to overlook what she had been doing with her father when their general interested brightness and beauty attuned tothe outbreak of summer had seemed to shed down warmth andwelcome and the promise of protection they were conjoined not todo anything to startle her and now at last so completely that with experience and practice they had almost ceased to feartheir liability mrs assingham on the other hand deprecatingsuch an accident not less had yet less assurance as having lesscontrol the high pitch of her cheer accordingly the tentative adventurous expressions of the would be smiling order thatpreceded her approach even like a squad of skirmishers orwhatever they were called moving ahead of the baggage train these things had at the end of a fortnight brought a dozen timesto our young woman s lips a challenge that had the cunning toawait its right occasion but of the relief of which as ademonstration she meanwhile felt no little need you ve such adread of my possibly complaining to you that you keep pealing allthe bells to drown my voice but don t cry out my dear tillyou re hurt and above all ask yourself how i can be so wicked asto complain what in the name of all that s fantastic can youdream that i have to complain of such inquiries the princesstemporarily succeeded in repressing and she did so in ameasure by the aid of her wondering if this ambiguity with whichher friend affected her wouldn t be at present a good deal likethe ambiguity with which she herself must frequently affect herfather she wondered how she should enjoy on his part such atake up as she but just succeeded from day to day in sparingmrs assingham and that made for her trying to be as easy withthis associate as mr verver blessed man all indulgent butall inscrutable was with his daughter she had extracted fromher none the less a vow in respect to the time that if thecolonel might be depended on they would spend at fawns andnothing came home to her more in this connection or inspiredher with a more intimate interest than her sense of absolutelyseeing her interlocutress forbear to observe that charlotte sview of a long visit even from such allies was there to bereckoned with fanny stood off from that proposition as visibly to the princess and as consciously to herself as she might have backed away fromthe edge of a chasm into which she feared to slip a truth thatcontributed again to keep before our young woman her own constantdanger of advertising her subtle processes that charlotte shouldhave begun to be restrictive about the assinghams which she hadnever and for a hundred obviously good reasons been before this in itself was a fact of the highest value for maggie and ofa value enhanced by the silence in which fanny herself so muchtoo unmistakably dressed it what gave it quite thrillingly itsprice was exactly the circumstance that it thus opposed her toher stepmother more actively if she was to back up her friendsfor holding out than she had ever yet been opposed though ofcourse with the involved result of the fine chance given mrs verver to ask her husband for explanations ah from the momentshe should be definitely caught in opposition there would benaturally no saying how much charlotte s opportunities mightmultiply what would become of her father she hauntedly asked if his wife on the one side should begin to press him to callhis daughter to order and the force of old habit to put it onlyat that should dispose him not less effectively to believe inthis young person at any price there she was all round imprisoned in the circle of the reasons it was impossible sheshould give certainly give him the house in the country was hishouse and thereby was charlotte s it was her own and amerigo sonly so far as its proper master and mistress should profuselyplace it at their disposal maggie felt of course that she saw nolimit to her father s profusion but this couldn t be even at thebest the case with charlotte s whom it would never be decent when all was said to reduce to fighting for her preferences there were hours truly when the princess saw herself as notunarmed for battle if battle might only take place withoutspectators this last advantage for her was however too sadly out of thequestion her sole strength lay in her being able to see that ifcharlotte wouldn t want the assinghams it would be because thatsentiment too would have motives and grounds she had all thewhile command of one way of meeting any objection any complaint on his wife s part reported to her by her father it would beopen to her to retort to his possible what are your reasons mydear by a lucidly produced what are hers love please isn tthat what we had better know mayn t her reasons be a dislike beautifully founded of the presence and thereby of theobservation of persons who perhaps know about her things it sinconvenient to her they should know that hideous card shemight in mere logic play being by this time at her stillswifter private pace intimately familiar with all the fingeredpasteboard in her pack but she could play it only on theforbidden issue of sacrificing him the issue so forbidden thatit involved even a horror of finding out if he would really haveconsented to be sacrificed what she must do she must do bykeeping her hands off him and nothing meanwhile as we see hadless in common with that scruple than such a mercilessmanipulation of their yielding beneficiaries as her spirit soboldly revelled in she saw herself in this connexion withoutdetachment saw others alone with intensity otherwise she mighthave been struck fairly have been amused by her free assignmentof the pachydermatous quality if she could face the awkwardnessof the persistence of her friends at fawns in spite of charlotte she somehow looked to them for an inspiration of courage thatwould improve upon her own they were in short not onlythemselves to find a plausibility and an audacity but weresomehow by the way to pick up these forms for her maggie aswell and she felt indeed that she was giving them scant timelonger when one afternoon in portland place she broke out withan irrelevance that was merely superficial what awfulness in heaven s name is there between them what doyou believe what do you know oh if she went by faces her visitor s sudden whiteness at this might have carried her far fanny assingham turned pale for it but there was something in such an appearance in the look it putinto the eyes that renewed maggie s conviction of what thiscompanion had been expecting she had been watching it come comefrom afar and now that it was there after all and the firstconvulsion over they would doubtless soon find themselves in amore real relation it was there because of the sunday luncheonthey had partaken of alone together it was there as strangelyas one would because of the bad weather the cold perverse junerain that was making the day wrong it was there because itstood for the whole sum of the perplexities and duplicities amongwhich our young woman felt herself lately to have picked hersteps it was there because amerigo and charlotte were againpaying together alone a week end visit which it had beenmaggie s plan infernally to promote just to see if this time they really would it was there because she had kept fanny onher side from paying one she would manifestly have been glad topay and had made her come instead stupidly vacantly boringly to luncheon all in the spirit of celebrating the fact that theprince and mrs verver had thus put it into her own power todescribe them exactly as they were it had abruptly occurred intruth that maggie required the preliminary help of determininghow they were though on the other hand before her guest hadanswered her question everything in the hour and the place everything in all the conditions affected her as crying it out her guest s stare of ignorance above all that of itself atfirst cried it out between them what do you mean anything there shouldn t be there shouldn t have been all thistime do you believe there is or what s your idea fanny s idea was clearly to begin with that her young friendhad taken her breath away but she looked at her very straightand very hard do you speak from a suspicion of your own i speak at last from a torment forgive me if it comes out i ve been thinking for months and months and i ve no one to turnto no one to help me to make things out no impression but myown don t you see to go by you ve been thinking for months and months mrs assingham tookit in but what then dear maggie have you been thinking well horrible things like a little beast that i perhaps am that there may be something something wrong and dreadful something they cover up the elder woman s colour had begun to come back she was able though with a visible effort to face the question less amazedly you imagine poor child that the wretches are in love is thatit but maggie for a minute only stared back at her help me to findout what i imagine i don t know i ve nothing but my perpetualanxiety have you any do you see what i mean if you ll tell metruly that at least one way or the other will do something forme fanny s look had taken a peculiar gravity a fulness with whichit seemed to shine is what it comes to that you re jealous ofcharlotte do you mean whether i hate her and maggie thought no noton account of father ah mrs assingham returned that isn t what one wouldsuppose what i ask is if you re jealous on account of yourhusband well said maggie presently perhaps that may be all if i munhappy i m jealous it must come to the same thing and withyou at least i m not afraid of the word if i m jealous don tyou see i m tormented she went on and all the more if i mhelpless and if i m both helpless and tormented i stuff mypocket handkerchief into my mouth i keep it there for the mostpart night and day so as not to be heard too indecentlymoaning only now with you at last i can t keep it longer i ve pulled it out and here i am fairly screaming at you they re away she wound up so they can t hear and i m by amiracle of arrangement not at luncheon with father at home ilive in the midst of miracles of arrangement half of which iadmit are my own i go about on tiptoe i watch for every sound i feel every breath and yet i try all the while to seem assmooth as old satin dyed rose colour have you ever thought ofme she asked as really feeling as i do her companion conspicuously required to be clear jealous unhappy tormented no said mrs assingham but at the sametime and though you may laugh at me for it i m bound toconfess that i ve never been so awfully sure of what i may callknowing you here you are indeed as you say such a deep littleperson i ve never imagined your existence poisoned and sinceyou wish to know if i consider that it need be i ve not theleast difficulty in speaking on the spot nothing decidedly strikes me as more unnecessary for a minute after this they remained face to face maggie hadsprung up while her friend sat enthroned and after moving toand fro in her intensity now paused to receive the light she hadinvoked it had accumulated considerably by this time roundmrs assingham s ample presence and it made even to our youngwoman s own sense a medium in which she could at last take adeeper breath i ve affected you these months and these lastweeks in especial as quiet and natural and easy but it was a question that took not imperceptibly someanswering you ve never affected me from the first hour ibeheld you as anything but in a way all your own absolutelygood and sweet and beautiful in a way as i say mrs assinghamalmost caressingly repeated just all your very own nobodyelse s at all i ve never thought of you but as outside of uglythings so ignorant of any falsity or cruelty or vulgarity asnever to have to be touched by them or to touch them i ve nevermixed you up with them there would have been time enough forthat if they had seemed to be near you but they haven t ifthat s what you want to know you ve only believed me contented then because you ve believedme stupid mrs assingham had a free smile now for the length of thisstride dissimulated though it might be in a graceful littlefrisk if i had believed you stupid i shouldn t have thought youinteresting and if i hadn t thought you interesting i shouldn thave noted whether i knew you as i ve called it or not whati ve always been conscious of is your having concealed about yousomewhere no small amount of character quite as much in fact fanny smiled as one could suppose a person of your size able tocarry the only thing was she explained that thanks to yournever calling one s attention to it i hadn t made out much moreabout it and should have been vague above all as to where youcarried it or kept it somewhere under i should simply havesaid like that little silver cross you once showed me blest bythe holy father that you always wear out of sight next yourskin that relic i ve had a glimpse of with which she continuedto invoke the privilege of humour but the precious littleinnermost say this time little golden personal nature of you blest by a greater power i think even than the pope thatyou ve never consentingly shown me i m not sure you ve everconsentingly shown it to anyone you ve been in general toomodest maggie trying to follow almost achieved a little fold of herforehead i strike you as modest to day modest when i standhere and scream at you oh your screaming i ve granted you is something new i mustfit it on somewhere the question is however mrs assinghamfurther proceeded of what the deuce i can fit it on to do youmean she asked to the fact of our friends being fromyesterday to to morrow at a place where they may more or lessirresponsibly meet she spoke with the air of putting it asbadly for them as possible are you thinking of their beingthere alone of their having consented to be and then as shehad waited without result for her companion to say but isn t ittrue that after you had this time again at the eleventh hour said you wouldn t they would really much rather not have gone yes they would certainly much rather not have gone but iwanted them to go then my dear child what in the world is the matter i wanted to see if they would and they ve had to maggieadded it was the only thing her friend appeared to wonder from the moment you and yourfather backed out oh i don t mean go for those people i mean go for us forfather and me maggie went on because now they know they know fanny assingham quavered that i ve been for some time past taking more notice notice ofthe queer things in our life maggie saw her companion for an instant on the point of askingher what these queer things might be but mrs assingham had thenext minute brushed by that ambiguous opening and taken as sheevidently felt a better one and is it for that you did it imean gave up the visit it s for that i did it to leave them to themselves as theyless and less want or at any rate less and less venture toappear to want to be left as they had for so long arrangedthings the princess went on you see they sometimes have tobe and then as if baffled by the lucidity of this mrs assingham for a little said nothing now do you think i mmodest with time however fanny could brilliantly think anything thatwould serve i think you re wrong that my dear is my answerto your question it demands assuredly the straightest i canmake i see no awfulness i suspect none i m deeplydistressed she added that you should do anything else it drew again from maggie a long look you ve never evenimagined anything ah god forbid for it s exactly as a woman of imagination thati speak there s no moment of my life at which i m not imaginingsomething and it s thanks to that darling mrs assinghampursued that i figure the sincerity with which your husband whom you see as viciously occupied with your stepmother isinterested is tenderly interested in his admirable adorablewife she paused a minute as to give her friend the full benefitof this as to maggie s measure of which however no sign came and then poor woman haplessly she crowned her effort hewouldn t hurt a hair of your head it had produced in maggie at once and apparently in theintended form of a smile the most extraordinary expression ah there it is but her guest had already gone on and i m absolutely certainthat charlotte wouldn t either it kept the princess with her strange grimace standing there no charlotte wouldn t either that s how they ve had again togo off together they ve been afraid not to lest it shoulddisturb me aggravate me somehow work upon me as i insistedthat they must that we couldn t all fail though father andcharlotte hadn t really accepted as i did this they had to yieldto the fear that their showing as afraid to move together wouldcount for them as the greater danger which would be the danger you see of my feeling myself wronged their least danger theyknow is in going on with all the things that i ve seemed toaccept and that i ve given no indication at any moment of notaccepting everything that has come up for them has come up inan extraordinary manner without my having by a sound or a signgiven myself away so that it s all as wonderful as you mayconceive they move at any rate among the dangers i speak of between that of their doing too much and that of their not havingany longer the confidence or the nerve or whatever you may callit to do enough her tone by this time might have shown astrangeness to match her smile which was still more marked asshe wound up and that s how i make them do what i like it had an effect on mrs assingham who rose with thedeliberation that from point to point marked the widening ofher grasp my dear child you re amazing amazing you re terrible maggie thoughtfully shook her head no i m not terrible andyou don t think me so i do strike you as surprising no doubt but surprisingly mild because don t you see i am mild i canbear anything oh bear mrs assingham fluted for love said the princess fanny hesitated of your father for love maggie repeated it kept her friend watching of your husband for love maggie said again it was for the moment as if the distinctness of this might havedetermined in her companion a choice between two or three highlydifferent alternatives mrs assingham s rejoinder at allevents however much or however little it was a choice waspresently a triumph speaking with this love of your own then have you undertaken to convey to me that you believe your husbandand your father s wife to be in act and in fact lovers of eachother and then as the princess didn t at first answer do youcall such an allegation as that mild oh i m not pretending to be mild to you but i ve told you andmoreover you must have seen for yourself how much so i ve beento them mrs assingham more brightly again bridled is that what youcall it when you make them for terror as you say do as youlike ah there wouldn t be any terror for them if they had nothing tohide mrs assingham faced her quite steady now are you reallyconscious love of what you re saying i m saying that i m bewildered and tormented and that i ve noone but you to speak to i ve thought i ve in fact been sure that you ve seen for yourself how much this is the case it s whyi ve believed you would meet me half way half way to what to denouncing fanny asked two persons friends of years whom i ve always immensely admired and liked and against whom i haven t the shadow of a charge to make maggie looked at her with wide eyes i had much rather youshould denounce me than denounce them denounce me denounce me she said if you can see your way it was exactly what sheappeared to have argued out with herself if conscientiously you can denounce me if conscientiously you can revile me if conscientiously you can put me in my place for a low mindedlittle pig well said mrs assingham consideringly as she paused foremphasis i think i shall be saved her friend took it for a minute however by carrying thoughtfuleyes eyes verily portentous over her head you say you ve noone to speak to and you make a point of your having so disguisedyour feelings not having as you call it given yourself away have you then never seen it not only as your right but as yourbounden duty worked up to such a pitch to speak to yourhusband i ve spoken to him said maggie mrs assingham stared ah then it isn t true that you ve madeno sign maggie had a silence i ve made no trouble i ve made no scene i ve taken no stand i ve neither reproached nor accused him you ll say there s a way in all that of being nasty enough oh dropped from fanny as if she couldn t help it but i don t think strangely enough that he regards me asnasty i think that at bottom for that is said the princess the strangeness he s sorry for me yes i think that deepwithin he pities me her companion wondered for the state you ve let yourself getinto for not being happy when i ve so much to make me so you ve everything said mrs assingham with alacrity yet sheremained for an instant embarrassed as to a further advance idon t understand however how if you ve done nothing an impatience from maggie had checked her i ve not doneabsolutely nothing but what then well she went on after a minute he knows what i ve done it produced on mrs assingham s part her whole tone and mannerexquisitely aiding a hush not less prolonged and the veryduration of which inevitably gave it something of the characterof an equal recognition and what then has he done maggie took again a minute he has been splendid splendid then what more do you want ah what you see said maggie not to be afraid it made her guest again hang fire not to be afraid really tospeak not to be afraid not to speak mrs assingham considered further you can t even to charlotte but as at this after a look at her maggie turned off with amovement of suppressed despair she checked herself and mighthave been watching her for all the difficulty and the pity ofit vaguely moving to the window and the view of the hill street it was almost as if she had had to give up from failure ofresponsive wit in her friend the last failure she had feared the hope of the particular relief she had been working for mrs assingham resumed the next instant however in the very tonethat seemed most to promise her she should have to give upnothing i see i see you would have in that case too manythings to consider it brought the princess round again provingitself thus the note of comprehension she wished most to clutchat don t be afraid maggie took it where she stood which she was soon able tosignify thank you it very properly encouraged her counsellor what your ideaimputes is a criminal intrigue carried on from day to day amidperfect trust and sympathy not only under your eyes but underyour father s that s an idea it s impossible for me for a moment to entertain ah there you are then it s exactly what i wanted from you you re welcome to it mrs assingham breathed you never have entertained it maggie pursued never for an instant said fanny with her head very high maggie took it again yet again as wanting more pardon my beingso horrid but by all you hold sacred mrs assingham faced her ah my dear upon my positive word asan honest woman thank you then said the princess so they remained a little after which but do you believe it love fanny inquired i believe you well as i ve faith in them it comes to the same thing maggie at this last appeared for a moment to think again butshe embraced the proposition the same thing then you re no longer unhappy her guest urged coming moregaily toward her i doubtless shan t be a great while but it was now mrs assingham s turn to want more i veconvinced you it s impossible she had held out her arms and maggie after a moment meetingher threw herself into them with a sound that had its oddity asa sign of relief impossible impossible she emphatically more than emphatically replied yet the next minute she hadburst into tears over the impossibility and a few seconds later pressing clinging sobbing had even caused them to flow audibly sympathetically and perversely from her friend xxxithe understanding appeared to have come to be that the coloneland his wife were to present themselves toward the middle of julyfor the good long visit at fawns on which maggie had obtainedfrom her father that he should genially insist as well as thatthe couple from eaton square should welcome there earlier in themonth and less than a week after their own arrival the adventof the couple from portland place oh we shall give you time tobreathe fanny remarked in reference to the general prospect with a gaiety that announced itself as heedless of criticism toeach member of the party in turn sustaining and bracing herselfby her emphasis pushed even to an amiable cynicism of theconfident view of these punctualities of the assinghams theground she could best occupy to her sense was that of her beingmoved as in this connexion she had always been moved by theadmitted grossness of her avidity the way the hospitality of theververs met her convenience and ministered to her ease destituteas the colonel had kept her from the first of any rusticretreat any leafy bower of her own any fixed base for the staleseason now at hand she had explained at home she had repeatedlyreexplained the terms of her dilemma the real difficulty ofher or as she now put it of their position when the paircould do nothing else in cadogan place they could still talk ofmarvellous little maggie and of the charm the sinister charm of their having to hold their breath to watch her a topic themomentous midnight discussion at which we have been present wasso far from having exhausted it came up irrepressibly at allprivate hours they had planted it there between them and itgrew from day to day in a manner to make their sense ofresponsibility almost yield to their sense of fascination mrs assingham declared at such moments that in the interest of thisadmirable young thing to whom she also declared she had quite come over she was ready to pass with all the world else evenwith the prince himself the object inconsequently as well ofher continued her explicitly shameless appreciation for avulgar indelicate pestilential woman showing her truecharacter in an abandoned old age the colonel s confessedattention had been enlisted we have seen as never yet underpressure from his wife by any guaranteed imbroglio but this she could assure him she perfectly knew was not a bit because hewas sorry for her or touched by what she had let herself in for but because when once they had been opened he couldn t keep hiseyes from resting complacently resting almost intelligently onthe princess if he was in love with her now however so muchthe better it would help them both not to wince at what theywould have to do for her mrs assingham had come back to that whenever he groaned or grunted she had at no beguiled moment since maggie s little march was positively beguiling let himlose sight of the grim necessity awaiting them we shall have as i ve again and again told you to lie for her to lie tillwe re black in the face to lie for her the colonel often at these hours as from avague vision of old chivalry in a new form wandered intoapparent lapses from lucidity to lie to her up and down and in and out it comes to the samething it will consist just as much of lying to the others too to the prince about one s belief in him to charlotte about one sbelief in her to mr verver dear sweet man about one s beliefin everyone so we ve work cut out with the biggest lie on topof all being that we like to be there for such a purpose wehate it unspeakably i m more ready to be a coward before it tolet the whole thing to let everyone selfishly andpusillanimously slide than before any social duty any felthuman call that has ever forced me to be decent i speak atleast for myself for you she had added as i ve given you soperfect an opportunity to fall in love with maggie you lldoubtless find your account in being so much nearer to her and what do you make the colonel could at this alwaysimperturbably enough ask of the account you yourself will findin being so much nearer to the prince of your confirmed if notexasperated infatuation with whom to say nothing of my weakgood nature about it you give such a pretty picture to the picture in question she had been always in fact ablecontemplatively to return the difficulty of my enjoyment ofthat is don t you see that i m making in my loyalty to maggie a sad hash of his affection for me you find means to call it then this whitewashing of his crime being loyal to maggie oh about that particular crime there is always much to say itis always more interesting to us than any other crime it has atleast that for it but of course i call everything i have in mindat all being loyal to maggie being loyal to her is more thananything else helping her with her father which is what shemost wants and needs the colonel had had it before but he could apparently never havetoo much of it helping her with him helping her against him then against what we ve already sofully talked of its having to be recognised between them that hedoubts that s where my part is so plain to see her through tosee her through to the end exaltation for the moment alwayslighted mrs assingham s reference to this plainness yet she atthe same time seldom failed the next instant to qualify herview of it when i talk of my obligation as clear i mean thatit s absolute for just how from day to day and through thickand thin to keep the thing up is i grant you another matter there s one way luckily nevertheless in which i m strong ican perfectly count on her the colonel seldom failed here as from the insidious growth ofan excitement to wonder to encourage not to see you relying to stick to me fast whatever she sees if i stick to her thatis to my own poor struggling way under providence of watchingover them all she ll stand by me to the death she won t give meaway for you know she easily can this regularly was the most lurid turn of their road but bobassingham with each journey met it as for the first time easily she can utterly dishonour me with her father she can let himknow that i was aware at the time of his marriage as i had beenaware at the time of her own of the relations that had pre existed between his wife and her husband and how can she do so if up to this minute by your ownstatement she is herself in ignorance of your knowledge it was a question that mrs assingham had ever for dealing with a manner to which repeated practice had given almost a grandeffect very much as if she was invited by it to say that aboutthis exactly she proposed to do her best lying but she said and with full lucidity something quite other it could giveitself a little the air still of a triumph over his coarseness by acting immediately with the blind resentment with which inher place ninety nine women out of a hundred would act and byso making mr verver in turn act with the same natural passion the passion of ninety nine men out of a hundred they ve only toagree about me the poor lady said they ve only to feel at oneover it feel bitterly practised upon cheated and injured they ve only to denounce me to each other as false and infamous for me to be quite irretrievably dished of course it s i whohave been and who continue to be cheated cheated by the princeand charlotte but they re not obliged to give me the benefit ofthat or to give either of us the benefit of anything they ll bewithin their rights to lump us all together as a false cruel conspiring crew and if they can find the right facts to supportthem get rid of us root and branch this on each occasion put the matter so at the worst thatrepetition even scarce controlled the hot flush with which shewas compelled to see the parts of the whole history all its uglyconsistency and its temporary gloss hang together she enjoyed invariably the sense of making her danger present of making itreal to her husband and of his almost turning pale when theireyes met at this possibility of their compromised state andtheir shared discredit the beauty was that as under a touch ofone of the ivory notes at the left of the keyboard he soundedout with the short sharpness of the dear fond stupid uneasy man conspiring so far as you were concerned to what end why to the obvious end of getting the prince a wife atmaggie s expense and then to that of getting charlotte a husbandat mr verver s of rendering friendly services yes which have produced as itturns out complications but from the moment you didn t do itfor the complications why shouldn t you have rendered them it was extraordinary for her always in this connexion how with time given him he fell to speaking better for her than shecould in the presence of her clear cut image of the worst speak for herself troubled as she was she thus never whollyfailed of her amusement by the way oh isn t what i may havemeddled for so far as it can be proved i did meddle open tointerpretation by which i mean to mr verver s and maggie s mayn t they see my motive in the light of that appreciation asthe wish to be decidedly more friendly to the others than to thevictimised father and daughter she positively liked to keep itup mayn t they see my motive as the determination to serve theprince in any case and at any price first to place himcomfortably in other words to find him his fill of money mayn tit have all the air for them of a really equivocal sinisterbargain between us something quite unholy and louche it produced in the poor colonel infallibly the echo louche love why haven t you said as much yourself haven t you put yourfinger on that awful possibility she had a way now with his felicities that made him enjoy beingreminded of them in speaking of your having always had such a mash such a mash precisely for the man i was to help to put sosplendidly at his ease a motherly mash an impartial look at itwould show it only as likely to have been but we re not talking of course about impartial looks we re talking of good innocentpeople deeply worked upon by a horrid discovery and going muchfurther in their view of the lurid as such people almost alwaysdo than those who have been wider awake all round from thefirst what i was to have got from my friend in such a view inexchange for what i had been able to do for him well that wouldhave been an equivalent of a kind best known to myself for meshrewdly to consider and she easily lost herself each time inthe anxious satisfaction of filling out the picture it wouldhave been seen it would have been heard of before the case ofthe woman a man doesn t want or of whom he s tired or for whomhe has no use but such uses and who is capable in herinfatuation in her passion of promoting his interests withother women rather than lose sight of him lose touch of him cease to have to do with him at all cela s est vu my dear andstranger things still as i needn t tell you very good then she wound up there is a perfectly possible conception of thebehaviour of your sweet wife since as i say there s noimagination so lively once it s started as that of reallyagitated lambs lions are nothing to them for lions aresophisticated are blases are brought up from the first toprowling and mauling it does give us you ll admit something tothink about my relief is luckily however in what i finally dothink he was well enough aware by this time of what she finally didthink but he was not without a sense again also for hisamusement by the way it would have made him for a spectator ofthese passages between the pair resemble not a little theartless child who hears his favourite story told for thetwentieth time and enjoys it exactly because he knows what isnext to happen what of course will pull them up if they turnout to have less imagination than you assume is the profit youcan have found in furthering mrs verver s marriage you weren tat least in love with charlotte oh mrs assingham at this always brought out my hand inthat is easily accounted for by my desire to be agreeable tohim to mr verver to the prince by preventing her in that way from taking as hewas in danger of seeing her do some husband with whom hewouldn t be able to open to keep open so large an account aswith his father in law i ve brought her near him kept herwithin his reach as she could never have remained either as asingle woman or as the wife of a different man kept her on that sweet construction to be his mistress kept her on that sweet construction to be his mistress shebrought it out grandly it had always so for her own ear as wellas visibly for her husband s its effect the facilities inthe case thanks to the particular conditions being so quiteideal down even to the facility of your minding everything so little from your own point of view as to have supplied him with theenjoyment of two beautiful women down even to that to the monstrosity of my folly but not mrs assingham added two of anything one beautiful woman and one beautiful fortune that s what a creature of pure virtueexposes herself to when she suffers her pure virtue suffers hersympathy her disinterestedness her exquisite sense for thelives of others to carry her too far voila i see it s the way the ververs have you it s the way the ververs have me it s in other words the waythey would be able to make such a show to each other of havingme if maggie weren t so divine she lets you off he never failed to insist on all this to thevery end which was how he had become so versed in what shefinally thought she lets me off so that now horrified and contrite at whati ve done i may work to help her out and mr verver she wasfond of adding lets me off too then you do believe he knows it determined in her always there with a significant pause adeep immersion in her thought i believe he would let me off ifhe did know so that i might work to help him out or rather really she went on that i might work to help maggie thatwould be his motive that would be his condition in forgivingme just as hers for me in fact her motive and her condition are my acting to spare her father but it s with maggie only thati m directly concerned nothing ever not a breath not a look i ll guarantee shall i have whatever happens from mr ververhimself so it is therefore that i shall probably by theclosest possible shave escape the penalty of my crimes you mean being held responsible i mean being held responsible my advantage will be thatmaggie s such a trump such a trump that as you say she ll stick to you stick to me on our understanding stick to me for ourunderstanding s signed and sealed and to brood over it againwas ever for mrs assingham to break out again with exaltation it s a grand high compact she has solemnly promised but in words oh yes in words enough since it s a matter of words to keepup her lie so long as i keep up mine and what do you call her lie why the pretence that she believes me believes they reinnocent she positively believes then they re guilty she has arrived atthat she s really content with it in the absence of proof it was here each time that fanny assingham most faltered butalways at last to get the matter for her own sense and with along sigh sufficiently straight it isn t a question of beliefor of proof absent or present it s inevitably with her aquestion of natural perception of insurmountable feeling sheirresistibly knows that there s something between them but shehasn t arrived at it as you say at all that s exactly whatshe hasn t done what she so steadily and intensely refuses todo she stands off and off so as not to arrive she keeps out tosea and away from the rocks and what she most wants of me is tokeep at a safe distance with her as i for my own skin only asknot to come nearer after which invariably she let him have itall so far from wanting proof which she must get in a manner by my siding with her she wants disproof as against herself and has appealed to me so extraordinarily to side against her it s really magnificent when you come to think of it the spiritof her appeal if i ll but cover them up brazenly enough theothers so as to show round and about them as happy as a bird she on her side will do what she can if i ll keep them quiet ina word it will enable her to gain time time as against any ideaof her father s and so somehow come out if i ll take care ofcharlotte in particular she ll take care of the prince andit s beautiful and wonderful really pathetic and exquisite tosee what she feels that time may do for her ah but what does she call poor little thing time well this summer at fawns to begin with she can live as yet of course but from hand to mouth but she has worked it out forherself i think that the very danger of fawns superficiallylooked at may practically amount to a greater protection therethe lovers if they are lovers will have to mind they ll feelit for themselves unless things are too utterly far gone withthem and things are not too utterly far gone with them she had inevitably poor woman her hesitation for this but sheput down her answer as for the purchase of some absolutelyindispensable article she would have put down her last shilling no it made him always grin at her is that a lie do you think you re worth lying to if it weren t the truth forme she added i wouldn t have accepted for fawns i can ibelieve keep the wretches quiet but how at the worst oh the worst don t talk about the worst i can keep themquiet at the best i seem to feel simply by our being there itwill work from week to week of itself you ll see he was willing enough to see but he desired to provide yetif it doesn t work ah that s talking about the worst well it might be but what were they doing from morning tonight at this crisis but talk who ll keep the others the others who ll keep them quiet if your couple have had a life together they can t have had it completely without witnesses without thehelp of persons however few who must have some knowledge someidea about them they ve had to meet secretly protectedly they ve had to arrange for if they haven t met and haven tarranged and haven t thereby in some quarter or other had togive themselves away why are we piling it up so therefore ifthere s evidence up and down london there must be people in possession of it ah it isn t all shealways remembered up and down london some of it must connectthem i mean she musingly added it naturally would withother places with who knows what strange adventures opportunities dissimulations but whatever there may have been it will also all have been buried on the spot oh they ve knownhow too beautifully but nothing all the same is likely tofind its way to maggie of itself because every one who may have anything to tell you hold willhave been so squared and then inveterately before she couldsay he enjoyed so much coming to this what will have squaredlady castledean the consciousness she had never lost her promptness ofhaving no stones to throw at any one else s windows she hasenough to do to guard her own glass that was what she wasdoing fanny said that last morning at matcham when all of uswent off and she kept the prince and charlotte over she helpedthem simply that she might herself be helped if it wasn tperhaps rather with her ridiculous mr blint that he might be they put in together therefore of course that day they got itclear and quite under her eyes inasmuch as they didn t becometraceable again as we know till late in the evening on thishistoric circumstance mrs assingham was always ready afresh tobrood but she was no less ready after her brooding devoutly toadd only we know nothing whatever else for which all our starsbe thanked the colonel s gratitude was apt to be less marked what did theydo for themselves all the same from the moment they got thatfree hand to the moment long after dinner time haven t you toldme of their turning up at their respective homes well it s none of your business i don t speak of it as mine but it s only too much theirs people are always traceable in england when tracings arerequired something sooner or later happens somebody sooneror later breaks the holy calm murder will out murder will but this isn t murder quite the contrary perhaps i verily believe she had her moments of adding that for theamusement of the row you would prefer an explosion this however was a remark he seldom noticed he wound up forthe most part after a long contemplative smoke with atransition from which no exposed futility in it had succeeded inweaning him what i can t for my life make out is your idea ofthe old boy charlotte s too inconceivably funny husband i have no idea i beg your pardon you ve just shown it you never speak of himbut as too inconceivably funny well he is she always confessed that is he may be for alli know too inconceivably great but that s not an idea itrepresents only my weak necessity of feeling that he s beyondme which isn t an idea either you see he may be stupid too precisely there you are yet on the other hand she always went on he may be sublime sublimer even than maggie herself he may in fact have alreadybeen but we shall never know with which her tone betrayedperhaps a shade of soreness for the single exemption she didn tyearningly welcome that i can see oh i say it came to affect the colonel himself with a senseof privation i m not sure even that charlotte will oh my dear what charlotte doesn t know but she brooded and brooded i m not sure even that the princewill it seemed privation in short for them all they ll bemystified confounded tormented but they won t know and alltheir possible putting their heads together won t make them that said fanny assingham will be their punishment and sheended ever when she had come so far at the same pitch itwill probably also if i get off with so little be mine and what her husband liked to ask will be mine nothing you re not worthy of any one s punishment is in whatone feels and what will make ours effective is that we shallfeel she was splendid with her ours she flared up with thisprophecy it will be maggie herself who will mete it out maggie she ll know about her father everything everything sherepeated on the vision of which each time mrs assingham aswith the presentiment of an odd despair turned away from it but she ll never tell us xxxiiif maggie had not so firmly made up her mind never to say eitherto her good friend or to any one else more than she meant abouther father she might have found herself betrayed into some suchoverflow during the week spent in london with her husband afterthe others had adjourned to fawns for the summer this wasbecause of the odd element of the unnatural imparted to the sosimple fact of their brief separation by the assumptions residentin their course of life hitherto she was used herself certainly by this time to dealing with odd elements but shedropped instantly even from such peace as she had patched up when it was a question of feeling that her unpenetrated parentmight be alone with them she thought of him as alone with themwhen she thought of him as alone with charlotte and this strangely enough even while fixing her sense to the full on hiswife s power of preserving quite of enhancing every felicitousappearance charlotte had done that under immeasurably fewerdifficulties indeed during the numerous months of their hymenealabsence from england the period prior to that wonderful reunionof the couples in the interest of the larger play of all thevirtues of each which was now bearing for mrs verver sstepdaughter at least such remarkable fruit it was the presentso much briefer interval in a situation possibly in a relation so changed it was the new terms of her problem that would taxcharlotte s art the princess could pull herself up repeatedly by remembering that the real relation between her father andhis wife was a thing that she knew nothing about and that instrictness was none of her business but she none the lessfailed to keep quiet as she would have called it before theprojected image of their ostensibly happy isolation nothingcould have had less of the quality of quietude than a certainqueer wish that fitfully flickered up in her a wish thatusurped perversely the place of a much more natural one ifcharlotte while she was about it could only have been worse that idea maggie fell to invoking instead of the idea that shemight desirably have been better for exceedingly odd as it wasto feel in such ways she believed she mightn t have worried somuch if she didn t somehow make her stepmother out under thebeautiful trees and among the dear old gardens as lavish offifty kinds of confidence and twenty kinds at least ofgentleness gentleness and confidence were certainly the rightthing as from a charming woman to her husband but the finetissue of reassurance woven by this lady s hands and flung overher companion as a light muffling veil formed precisely awrought transparency through which she felt her father s eyescontinually rest on herself the reach of his gaze came to herstraighter from a distance it showed him as still moreconscious down there alone of the suspected the feltelaboration of the process of their not alarming or hurting him she had herself now for weeks and weeks and all unwinkingly traced the extension of this pious effort but her perfectsuccess in giving no sign she did herself that credit wouldhave been an achievement quite wasted if mrs verver should makewith him those mistakes of proportion one set of them tooabruptly too incoherently designed to correct another set thatshe had made with his daughter however if she had been worse poor woman who should say that her husband would to acertainty have been better one groped noiselessly among such questions and it was actuallynot even definite for the princess that her own amerigo leftalone with her in town had arrived at the golden mean ofnon precautionary gallantry which would tend by his calculation to brush private criticism from its last perching place thetruth was in this connection that she had different sorts ofterrors and there were hours when it came to her that these dayswere a prolonged repetition of that night drive of weeks before from the other house to their own when he had tried to charmher by his sovereign personal power into some collapse thatwould commit her to a repudiation of consistency she was neveralone with him it was to be said without her having sooner orlater to ask herself what had already become of her consistency yet at the same time so long as she breathed no charge shekept hold of a remnant of appearance that could save her fromattack attack real attack from him as he would conduct itwas what she above all dreaded she was so far from sure thatunder that experience she mightn t drop into some depth ofweakness mightn t show him some shortest way with her that hewould know how to use again therefore since she had given him as yet no moment s pretext for pretending to her that she hadeither lost faith or suffered by a feather s weight in happiness she left him it was easy to reason with an immense advantagefor all waiting and all tension she wished him for the present to make up to her for nothing who could say to what making upmight lead into what consenting or pretending or destroyingblindness it might plunge her she loved him too helplessly still to dare to open the door by an inch to his treating heras if either of them had wronged the other something orsomebody and who at this which of them all would inevitably would in the gust of momentary selfishness be sacrificed tothat whereas what she intelligently needed was to know where shewas going knowledge knowledge was a fascination as well as afear and a part precisely of the strangeness of this juncturewas the way her apprehension that he would break out to her withsome merely general profession was mixed with her dire need toforgive him to reassure him to respond to him on no groundthat she didn t fully measure to do these things it must beclear to her what they were for but to act in that light was bythe same effect to learn horribly what the other things hadbeen he might tell her only what he wanted only what would workupon her by the beauty of his appeal and the result of thedirect appeal of any beauty in him would be her helplesssubmission to his terms all her temporary safety her hand to mouth success accordingly was in his neither perceiving nordivining this thanks to such means as she could take to preventhim take literally from hour to hour during these days of moreunbroken exposure from hour to hour she fairly expected somesign of his having decided on a jump ah yes it has been as youthink i ve strayed away i ve fancied myself free given myselfin other quantities with larger generosities because i thoughtyou were different different from what i now see but it wasonly only because i didn t know and you must admit that yougave me scarce reason enough reason enough i mean to keepclear of my mistake to which i confess for which i ll doexquisite penance which you can help me now i too beautifullyfeel to get completely over that was what while she watched herself she potentially heardhim bring out and while she carried to an end another day another sequence and yet another of their hours together withouthis producing it she felt herself occupied with him beyond eventhe intensity of surrender she was keeping her head for areason for a cause and the labour of this detachment with thelabour of her keeping the pitch of it down held them together inthe steel hoop of an intimacy compared with which artless passionwould have been but a beating of the air her greatest danger orat least her greatest motive for care was the obsession of thethought that if he actually did suspect the fruit of hisattention to her couldn t help being a sense of the growth of herimportance taking the measure with him as she had taken itwith her father of the prescribed reach of her hypocrisy shesaw how it would have to stretch even to her seeking to provethat she was not all the same important a single touch fromhim oh she should know it in case of its coming any brush ofhis hand of his lips of his voice inspired by recognition ofher probable interest as distinct from pity for her virtualgloom would hand her over to him bound hand and foot thereforeto be free to be free to act other than abjectly for herfather she must conceal from him the validity that like amicroscopic insect pushing a grain of sand she was taking oneven for herself she could keep it up with a change in sight but she couldn t keep it up forever so that really oneextraordinary effect of their week of untempered confrontation which bristled with new marks was to make her reach out inthought to their customary companions and calculate the kind ofrelief that rejoining them would bring she was learning almostfrom minute to minute to be a mistress of shades since always when there were possibilities enough of intimacy there were also by that fact in intercourse possibilities of iridescence but she was working against an adversary who was a master ofshades too and on whom if she didn t look out she shouldpresently have imposed a consciousness of the nature of theirstruggle to feel him in fact to think of his feeling himself her adversary in things of this fineness to see him at all inshort brave a name that would represent him as in opposition was already to be nearly reduced to a visible smotheringof her cry of alarm should he guess they were having in theirso occult manner a high fight and that it was she all thewhile in her supposed stupidity who had made it high and waskeeping it high in the event of his doing this before they couldleave town she should verily be lost the possible respite for her at fawns would come from the factthat observation in him there would inevitably find some ofits directness diverted this would be the case if only becausethe remarkable strain of her father s placidity might be thoughtof as likely to claim some larger part of his attention besideswhich there would be always charlotte herself to draw him off charlotte would help him again doubtless to study anything right or left that might be symptomatic but maggie could seethat this very fact might perhaps contribute in its degree toprotect the secret of her own fermentation it is not evenincredible that she may have discovered the gleam of a comfortthat was to broaden in the conceivable effect on the prince sspirit on his nerves on his finer irritability of some of thevery airs and aspects the light graces themselves of mrs verver s too perfect competence what it would most come to after all she said to herself was a renewal for him of theprivilege of watching that lady watch her very well then withthe elements after all so mixed in him how long would he go onenjoying mere spectatorship of that act for she had by this timemade up her mind that in charlotte s company he deferred tocharlotte s easier art of mounting guard wouldn t he get tired to put it only at that of seeing her always on the rampart erect and elegant with her lace flounced parasol now folded andnow shouldered march to and fro against a gold coloured east orwest maggie had gone far truly for a view of the question ofthis particular reaction and she was not incapable of pullingherself up with the rebuke that she counted her chickens beforethey were hatched how sure she should have to be of so manythings before she might thus find a weariness in amerigo sexpression and a logic in his weariness one of her dissimulated arts for meeting their tension meanwhile was to interweave mrs assingham as plausibly aspossible with the undulations of their surface to bring it aboutthat she should join them of an afternoon when they drovetogether or if they went to look at things looking at thingsbeing almost as much a feature of their life as if they werebazaar opening royalties then there were such combinations later in the day as her attendance on them and the colonel s aswell for such whimsical matters as visits to the opera no matterwho was singing and sudden outbreaks of curiosity about thebritish drama the good couple from cadogan place could alwaysunprotestingly dine with them and go on afterwards to suchpublicities as the princess cultivated the boldness of nowperversely preferring it may be said of her that during thesepassages she plucked her sensations by the way detached nervously the small wild blossoms of her dim forest so that shecould smile over them at least with the spacious appearance forher companions for her husband above all of bravely ofaltogether frivolously going a maying she had her intense hersmothered excitements some of which were almost inspirations she had in particular the extravagant positively at moments theamused sense of using her friend to the topmost notch accompanied with the high luxury of not having to explain never no never should she have to explain to fanny assingham again who poor woman on her own side would be charged it might beforever with that privilege of the higher ingenuity she put itall off on fanny and the dear thing herself might henceforthappraise the quantity more and more magnificent now in herblameless egoism maggie asked no questions of her and thus onlysignified the greatness of the opportunity she gave her shedidn t care for what devotions what dinners of their own theassinghams might have been booked that was a detail and shecould think without wincing of the ruptures and rearrangements towhich her service condemned them it all fell in beautifully moreover so that as hard at this time in spite of her fever as a little pointed diamond the princess showed something of theglitter of consciously possessing the constructive the creativehand she had but to have the fancy of presenting herself ofpresenting her husband in a certain high and convenient manner to make it natural they should go about with their gentleman andtheir lady to what else but this exactly had charlotte duringso many weeks of the earlier season worked her up herselfassuming and discharging so far as might be the character andoffice of one of those revolving subordinate presences that floatin the wake of greatness the precedent was therefore established and the group normallyconstituted mrs assingham meanwhile at table on the stairs in the carriage or the opera box might with her constantoverflow of expression for that matter and its singularlyresident character where men in especial were concerned lookacross at amerigo in whatever sense she liked it was not of thatmaggie proposed to be afraid she might warn him she mightrebuke him she might reassure him she might if it wereimpossible not to absolutely make love to him even this wasopen to her as a matter simply between them if it would helpher to answer for the impeccability he had guaranteed and maggiedesired in fact only to strike her as acknowledging the efficacyof her aid when she mentioned to her one evening a smallproject for the morrow privately entertained the idea irresistible intense of going to pay at the museum a visit tomr crichton mr crichton as mrs assingham could easilyremember was the most accomplished and obliging of publicfunctionaries whom every one knew and who knew every one whohad from the first in particular lent himself freely and forthe love of art and history to becoming one of the steadierlights of mr verver s adventurous path the custodian of one ofthe richest departments of the great national collection ofprecious things he could feel for the sincere private collectorand urge him on his way even when condemned to be present at hiscapture of trophies sacrificed by the country to parliamentarythrift he carried his amiability to the point of saying that since london under pettifogging views had to miss from time totime its rarest opportunities he was almost consoled to seesuch lost causes invariably wander at last one by one with thetormenting tinkle of their silver bells into the wondrous thealready famous fold beyond the mississippi there was a charm inhis almosts that was not to be resisted especially after mr verver and maggie had grown sure or almost again of enjoyingthe monopoly of them and on this basis of envy changed tosympathy by the more familiar view of the father and thedaughter mr crichton had at both houses though especially ineaton square learned to fill out the responsive and suggestivecharacter it was at his invitation fanny well recalled thatmaggie one day long before and under her own attendanceprecisely had for the glory of the name she bore paid a visitto one of the ampler shrines of the supreme exhibitory temple analcove of shelves charged with the gold and brown gold and ivory of old italian bindings and consecrated to the records ofthe prince s race it had been an impression that penetrated that remained yet maggie had sighed ever so prettily at itshaving to be so superficial she was to go back some day to divedeeper to linger and taste in spite of which however mrs assingham could not recollect perceiving that the visit had beenrepeated this second occasion had given way for a long time inher happy life to other occasions all testifying in theirdegree to the quality of her husband s blood its rich mixtureand its many remarkable references after which no doubt thecharming piety involved had grown on still further grounds bewildered and faint it now appeared none the less that some renewed conversationwith mr crichton had breathed on the faintness revivingly andmaggie mentioned her purpose as a conception of her very own tothe success of which she designed to devote her morning visitsof gracious ladies under his protection lighted up rosily forthis perhaps most flower loving and honey sipping member of thegreat bloomsbury hive its packed passages and cells and thoughnot sworn of the province toward which his friend had foundherself according to her appeal to him yearning again nothingwas easier for him than to put her in relation with the presidingurbanities so it had been settled maggie said to mrs assingham and she was to dispense with amerigo s company fannywas to remember later on that she had at first taken this lastfact for one of the finer notes of her young woman s detachment imagined she must be going alone because of the shade of ironythat in these ambiguous days her husband s personal presencemight be felt to confer practically on any tribute to histransmitted significance then as the next moment she felt itclear that so much plotted freedom was virtually a refinement ofreflection an impulse to commemorate afresh whatever might stillsurvive of pride and hope her sense of ambiguity happily felland she congratulated her companion on having anything soexquisite to do and on being so exquisitely in the humour to doit after the occasion had come and gone she was confirmed in heroptimism she made out in the evening that the hour spent amongthe projected lights the annals and illustrations theparchments and portraits the emblazoned volumes and the murmuredcommentary had been for the princess enlarging and inspiring maggie had said to her some days before very sweetly but veryfirmly invite us to dine please for friday and have any oneyou like or you can it doesn t in the least matter whom andthe pair in cadogan place had bent to this mandate with adocility not in the least ruffled by all that it took forgranted it provided for an evening this had been maggie s view and shelived up to her view in her friend s eyes by treating theoccasion more or less explicitly as new and strange the goodassinghams had feasted in fact at the two other boards on a scaleso disproportionate to the scant solicitations of their own thatit was easy to make a joke of seeing how they fed at home howthey met themselves the question of giving to eat maggie dinedwith them in short and arrived at making her husband appear todine much in the manner of a pair of young sovereigns who have in the frolic humour of the golden years of reigns proposedthemselves to a pair of faithfully serving subjects she showedan interest in their arrangements an inquiring tenderness almostfor their economies so that her hostess not unnaturally as theymight have said put it all down the tone and the freedom ofwhich she set the example to the effect wrought in her afresh byone of the lessons learned in the morning at the altar of thepast hadn t she picked it up from an anecdote or two offeredagain to her attention that there were for princesses of such aline more ways than one of being a heroine maggie s wayto night was to surprise them all truly by the extravagance ofher affability she was doubtless not positively boisterous yet though mrs assingham as a bland critic had never doubted herbeing graceful she had never seen her put so much of it intobeing what might have been called assertive it was all a tune towhich fanny s heart could privately palpitate her guest washappy happy as a consequence of something that had occurred butshe was making the prince not lose a ripple of her laugh thoughnot perhaps always enabling him to find it absolutely notfoolish foolish in public beyond a certain point he wasscarce the man to brook his wife s being thought to be so thatthere hovered before their friend the possibility of somesubsequent scene between them in the carriage or at home ofslightly sarcastic inquiry of promptly invited explanation ascene that according as maggie should play her part in it mightor might not precipitate developments what made theseappearances practically thrilling meanwhile was this mystery amystery it was clear to amerigo himself of the incident or theinfluence that had so peculiarly determined them the lady of cadogan place was to read deeper however withinthree days and the page was turned for her on the eve of heryoung confidant s leaving london the awaited migration to fawnswas to take place on the morrow and it was known meanwhile tomrs assingham that their party of four were to dine that night at the american embassy with another and a larger party so thatthe elder woman had a sense of surprise on receiving from theyounger under date of six o clock a telegram requesting herimmediate attendance please come to me at once dress early ifnecessary so that we shall have time the carriage ordered forus will take you back first mrs assingham on quickdeliberation dressed though not perhaps with full lucidity andby seven o clock was in portland place where her friend upstairs and described to her on her arrival as herself engagedin dressing instantly received her she knew on the spot poorfanny as she was afterwards to declare to the colonel that herfeared crisis had popped up as at the touch of a spring that herimpossible hour was before her her impossible hour was the hourof its coming out that she had known of old so much more than shehad ever said and she had often put it to herself inapprehension she tried to think even in preparation that sheshould recognise the approach of her doom by a consciousness akinto that of the blowing open of a window on some night of thehighest wind and the lowest thermometer it would be all in vainto have crouched so long by the fire the glass would have beensmashed the icy air would fill the place if the air in maggie sroom then on her going up was not as yet quite the polarblast she had expected it was distinctly none the less such anatmosphere as they had not hitherto breathed together theprincess she perceived was completely dressed that businesswas over it added indeed to the effect of her importantlyawaiting the assistance she had summoned of her showing a deckcleared so to speak for action her maid had already left her and she presented herself in the large clear room whereeverything was admirable but where nothing was out of place as for the first time in her life rather bedizened was it thatshe had put on too many things overcharged herself with jewels wore in particular more of them than usual and bigger ones inher hair a question her visitor presently answered byattributing this appearance largely to the bright red spot redas some monstrous ruby that burned in either of her cheeks these two items of her aspect had promptly enough their ownlight for mrs assingham who made out by it that nothing morepathetic could be imagined than the refuge and disguise heragitation had instinctively asked of the arts of dress multiplied to extravagance almost to incoherence she had had visibly her idea that of not betraying herself by inattentionsinto which she had never yet fallen and she stood there circledabout and furnished forth as always in a manner that testifiedto her perfect little personal processes it had ever been hersign that she was for all occasions found ready without looseends or exposed accessories or unremoved superfluities asuggestion of the swept and garnished in her whole splendid yetthereby more or less encumbered and embroidered setting thatreflected her small still passion for order and symmetry forobjects with their backs to the walls and spoke even of someprobable reference in her american blood to dusting andpolishing new england grandmothers if her apartment was princely in the clearness of the lingering day she looked asif she had been carried there prepared all attired anddecorated like some holy image in a procession and left precisely to show what wonder she could work under pressure herfriend felt how could she not as the truly pious priest mightfeel when confronted behind the altar before the festa withhis miraculous madonna such an occasion would be grave ingeneral with all the gravity of what he might look for but thegravity to night would be of the rarest what he might look forwould depend so on what he could give xxxiii something very strange has happened and i think you ought toknow it maggie spoke this indeed without extravagance yet with theeffect of making her guest measure anew the force of her appeal it was their definite understanding whatever fanny knew fanny sfaith would provide for and she knew accordingly at the end offive minutes what the extraordinary in the late occurrence hadconsisted of and how it had all come of maggie s achieved hour under mr crichton s protection at the museum he had desired mr crichton with characteristic kindness after the wonderfulshow after offered luncheon at his incorporated lodge hard by to see her safely home especially on his noting in attendingher to the great steps that she had dismissed her carriage which she had done really just for the harmless amusement oftaking her way alone she had known she should find herself asthe consequence of such an hour in a sort of exalted state under the influence of which a walk through the london streetswould be exactly what would suit her best an independent ramble impressed excited contented with nothing to mind and nobody totalk to and shop windows in plenty to look at if she liked alow taste of the essence it was to be supposed of her nature that she had of late for so many reasons been unable togratify she had taken her leave with her thanks she knew herway quite enough it being also sufficiently the case that shehad even a shy hope of not going too straight to wander a littlewild was what would truly amuse her so that keeping clear ofoxford street and cultivating an impression as of parts shedidn t know she had ended with what she had more or less hadbeen fancying an encounter with three or four shops an oldbookseller s an old printmonger s a couple of places with dimantiquities in the window that were not as so many of the othershops those in sloane street say a hollow parade which hadlong since ceased to beguile there had remained with hermoreover an allusion of charlotte s of some months before seeddropped into her imagination in the form of a casual speech aboutthere being in bloomsbury such funny little fascinating placesand even sometimes such unexpected finds there could perhapshave been no stronger mark than this sense of well nigh romanticopportunity no livelier sign of the impression made on her andalways so long retained so watchfully nursed by any observationof charlotte s however lightly thrown off and then she hadfelt somehow more at her ease than for months and monthsbefore she didn t know why but her time at the museum oddly had done it it was as if she hadn t come into so many noble andbeautiful associations nor secured them also for her boy secured them even for her father only to see them turn to vanityand doubt turn possibly to something still worse i believed inhim again as much as ever and i felt how i believed in him shesaid with bright fixed eyes i felt it in the streets as iwalked along and it was as if that helped me and lifted me up my being off by myself there not having for the moment towonder and watch having on the contrary almost nothing on mymind it was so much as if everything would come out right that she hadfallen to thinking of her father s birthday had given herselfthis as a reason for trying what she could pick up for it theywould keep it at fawns where they had kept it before since itwould be the twenty first of the month and she mightn t haveanother chance of making sure of something to offer him therewas always the impossibility of course of finding him anything the least bit good that he wouldn t already long ago in hisrummagings have seen himself and only not to think a quartergood enough this however was an old story and one could nothave had any fun with him but for his sweet theory that theindividual gift the friendship s offering was by a rigorouslaw of nature a foredoomed aberration and that the more it wasso the more it showed and the more one cherished it for showing how friendly it had been the infirmity of art was the candour ofaffection the grossness of pedigree the refinement of sympathy the ugliest objects in fact as a general thing were thebravest the tenderest mementos and as such figured in glasscases apart worthy doubtless of the home but not worthy of thetemple dedicated to the grimacing not to the clear faced gods she herself naturally through the past years had come to bemuch represented in those receptacles against the thick lockedpanes of which she still liked to flatten her nose finding inits place each time everything she had on successiveanniversaries tried to believe he might pretend at hersuggestion to be put off with or at least think curious shewas now ready to try it again they had always with his pleasurein her pretence and her pleasure in his with the funny betrayalof the sacrifice to domestic manners on either side played thegame so happily to this end on her way home she had loiteredeverywhere quite too deludedly among the old books and the oldprints which had yielded nothing to her purpose but with astrange inconsequence in one of the other shops that of a smallantiquarian a queer little foreign man who had shown her anumber of things shown her finally something that struck withit as rather a rarity and thinking it would compared to some ofher ventures quite superlatively do she had bought boughtreally when it came to that for a price it appears now itwon t do at all said maggie something has happened since thatputs it quite out of the question i had only my day ofsatisfaction in it but i feel at the same time as i keep ithere before me that i wouldn t have missed it for the world she had talked from the first of her friend s entrancescoherently enough even with a small quaver that overstated hercalm but she held her breath every few seconds as if fordeliberation and to prove she didn t pant all of which markedfor fanny the depth of her commotion her reference to herthought about her father about her chance to pick up somethingthat might divert him her mention in fine of his fortitudeunder presents having meanwhile naturally it should be said much less an amplitude of insistence on the speaker s lips than apower to produce on the part of the listener herself the promptresponse and full comprehension of memory and sympathy of oldamused observation the picture was filled out by the latter sfond fancy but maggie was at any rate under arms she knew whatshe was doing and had already her plan a plan for making forallowing as yet no difference in accordance with which shewould still dine out and not with red eyes nor convulsedfeatures nor neglected items of appearance nor anything thatwould raise a question yet there was some knowledge that exactly to this support of her not breaking down she desired she required possession of and with the sinister rise and fallof lightning unaccompanied by thunder it played before mrs assingham s eyes that she herself should have at whatever riskor whatever cost to supply her with the stuff of her need allour friend s instinct was to hold off from this till she shouldsee what the ground would bear she would take no step nearerunless intelligibly to meet her and awkward though it might beto hover there only pale and distorted with mere imbecilities ofvagueness there was a quality of bald help in the fact of not asyet guessing what such an ominous start could lead to shecaught however after a second s thought at the princess sallusion to her lost reassurance you mean you were so at your ease on monday the night you dinedwith us i was very happy then said maggie yes we thought you so gay and so brilliant fanny felt itfeeble but she went on we were so glad you were happy maggie stood a moment at first only looking at her you thoughtme all right eh surely dearest we thought you all right well i daresay it was natural but in point of fact i never wasmore wrong in my life for all the while if you please thiswas brewing mrs assingham indulged as nearly as possible to luxury hervagueness this that replied the princess whose eyes her companion now saw had turned to an object on the chimney piece of the room ofwhich among so many precious objects the ververs wherever theymight be always revelled peculiarly in matchless old mantelornaments her visitor had not taken heed do you mean the gilt cup i mean the gilt cup the piece now recognised by fanny as new to her own vision was acapacious bowl of old looking rather strikingly yellow gold mounted by a short stem on an ample foot which held a centralposition above the fire place where to allow it the better toshow a clearance had been made of other objects notably of thelouis seize clock that accompanied the candelabra this lattertrophy ticked at present on the marble slab of a commode thatexactly matched it in splendour and style mrs assingham tookit the bowl as a fine thing but the question was obviously notof its intrinsic value and she kept off from it admiring it ata distance but what has that to do it has everything you ll see with which again however forthe moment maggie attached to her strange wide eyes he knewher before before i had ever seen him he knew but fanny while she cast about her for the linksshe missed could only echo it amerigo knew charlotte more than i ever dreamed fanny felt then it was stare for stare but surely you alwaysknew they had met i didn t understand i knew too little don t you see what imean the princess asked mrs assingham wondered during these instants how much she evennow knew it had taken a minute to perceive how gently she wasspeaking with that perception of its being no challenge ofwrath no heat of the deceived soul but only a free exposure ofthe completeness of past ignorance inviting derision even if itmust the elder woman felt first a strange barely crediblerelief she drew in as if it had been the warm summer scent of aflower the sweet certainty of not meeting any way she shouldturn any consequence of judgment she shouldn t be judged saveby herself which was her own wretched business the next moment however at all events she blushed within for her immediatecowardice she had thought of herself thought of getting off before so much as thinking that is of pitifully seeing that shewas in presence of an appeal that was all an appeal that utterlyaccepted its necessity in a general way dear child yes butnot a in connexion with what you ve been telling me they were intimate you see intimate said the princess fanny continued to face her taking from her excited eyes thishistory so dim and faint for all her anxious emphasis of thefar away other time there s always the question of what oneconsiders what one considers intimate well i know what i considerintimate now too intimate said maggie to let me knowanything about it it was quiet yes but not too quiet for fanny assingham scapacity to wince only compatible with letting me you mean she had asked it after a pause but turning again to the newornament of the chimney and wondering even while she took relieffrom it at this gap in her experience but here are things mydear of which my ignorance is perfect they went about together they re known to have done it and idon t mean only before i mean after after said fanny assingham before we were married yes but after we were engaged ah i ve known nothing about that and she said it with abraver assurance clutching with comfort at something that wasapparently new to her that bowl maggie went on is so strangely too strangely almost to believe at this time of day the proof they weretogether all the while up to the very eve of our marriage don tyou remember how just before that she came back so unexpectedly from america the question had for mrs assingham and whether all consciouslyor not the oddest pathos of simplicity oh yes dear of coursei remember how she came back from america and how she stayedwith us and what view one had of it maggie s eyes still all the time pressed and penetrated sothat during a moment just here she might have given the littleflare have made the little pounce of asking what then one s view had been to the small flash of this eruption fanny stood for her minute wittingly exposed but she saw it as quicklycease to threaten quite saw the princess even though in all herpain refuse in the interest of their strange and exaltedbargain to take advantage of the opportunity for planting thestab of reproach the opportunity thus coming all of itself shesaw her or she believed she saw her look at her chance forstraight denunciation look at it and then pass it by and shefelt herself with this fact hushed well nigh to awe at thelucid higher intention that no distress could confound and thatno discovery since it was however obscurely a case of discovery could make less needful these seconds were brief they rapidly passed but they lasted long enough to renew ourfriend s sense of her own extraordinary undertaking the functionagain imposed on her the answerability again drilled into her by this intensity of intimation she was reminded of the terms onwhich she was let off her quantity of release having made itssufficient show in that recall of her relation to charlotte s oldreappearance and deep within the whole impression glowed ah soinspiringly when it came to that her steady view clear from thefirst of the beauty of her companion s motive it was like afresh sacrifice for a larger conquest only see me through now do it in the face of this and in spite of it and i leave you ahand of which the freedom isn t to be said the aggravation offear or call it apparently of knowledge had jumped straightinto its place as an aggravation above all for her father theeffect of this being but to quicken to passion her reasons formaking his protectedness or in other words the forms of hisignorance still the law of her attitude and the key to hersolution she kept as tight hold of these reasons and theseforms in her confirmed horror as the rider of a plunging horsegrasps his seat with his knees and she might absolutely havebeen putting it to her guest that she believed she could stay onif they should only meet nothing more though ignorant still ofwhat she had definitely met fanny yearned within over herspirit and so no word about it said passed through merepitying eyes a vow to walk ahead and at crossroads with alantern for the darkness and wavings away for unadvised traffic look out for alarms there was accordingly no wait in maggie sreply they spent together hours spent at least a morning thecertainty of which has come back to me now but that i didn tdream of it at the time that cup there has turned witness bythe most wonderful of chances that s why since it has beenhere i ve stood it out for my husband to see put it where itwould meet him almost immediately if he should come into theroom i ve wanted it to meet him she went on and i ve wantedhim to meet it and to be myself present at the meeting but thathasn t taken place as yet often as he has lately been in the wayof coming to see me here yes in particular lately he hasn tshowed to day it was with her managed quietness more and more that she talked an achieved coherence that helped her evidently to hear and to watch herself there was support andthereby an awful harmony but which meant a further guidance inthe facts she could add together it s quite as if he had aninstinct something that has warned him off or made him uneasy he doesn t quite know naturally what has happened but guesses with his beautiful cleverness that something has and isn t in ahurry to be confronted with it so in his vague fear he keepsoff but being meanwhile in the house i ve no idea not having seen him to day by exception sincebefore luncheon he spoke to me then the princess freelyexplained of a ballot of great importance at a club forsomebody some personal friend i think who s coming up and issupposed to be in danger to make an effort for him he thought hehad better lunch there you see the efforts he can make forwhich maggie found a smile that went to her friend s heart he sin so many ways the kindest of men but it was hours ago mrs assingham thought the more danger then of his coming inand finding me here i don t know you see what you now considerthat you ve ascertained nor anything of the connexion with it ofthat object that you declare so damning her eyes rested on thisodd acquisition and then quitted it went back to it and againturned from it it was inscrutable in its rather stupid elegance and yet from the moment one had thus appraised it vivid anddefinite in its domination of the scene fanny could no moreoverlook it now than she could have overlooked a lightedchristmas tree but nervously and all in vain she dipped into hermind for some floating reminiscence of it at the same time thatthis attempt left her blank she understood a good deal she evennot a little shared the prince s mystic apprehension the goldenbowl put on under consideration a sturdy a consciousperversity as a document somehow it was ugly though itmight have a decorative grace his finding me here in presenceof it might be more flagrantly disagreeable for all of us thanyou intend or than would necessarily help us and i must taketime truly to understand what it means you re safe as far as that goes maggie returned you maytake it from me that he won t come in and that i shall only findhim below waiting for me when i go down to the carriage fanny assingham took it from her took it and more we re to sittogether at the ambassador s then or at least you two are withthis new complication thrust up before you all unexplained andto look at each other with faces that pretend for the ghastlyhour not to be seeing it maggie looked at her with a face that might have been the one shewas preparing unexplained my dear quite the contrary explained fully intensely admirably explained with nothingreally to add my own love she kept it up i don t wantanything more i ve plenty to go upon and to do with as it is fanny assingham stood there in her comparative darkness with herlinks verily still missing but the most acceptable effect ofthis was singularly as yet a cold fear of getting nearer thefact but when you come home i mean he ll come up with youagain won t he see it then on which maggie gave her after an instant s visible thought thestrangest of slow headshakes i don t know perhaps he ll neversee it if it only stands there waiting for him he may neveragain said the princess come into this room fanny more deeply wondered never again oh yes it may be how do i know with this she quietly went on she had not looked again at the incriminating piece but therewas a marvel to her friend in the way the little wordrepresenting it seemed to express and include for her the wholeof her situation then you intend not to speak to him maggie waited to speak well about your having it and about what you consider that itrepresents oh i don t know that i shall speak if he doesn t but hiskeeping away from me because of that what will that be but tospeak he can t say or do more it won t be for me to speak maggie added in a different tone one of the tones that hadalready so penetrated her guest it will be for me to listen mrs assingham turned it over then it all depends on thatobject that you regard for your reasons as evidence i think i may say that i depend on it i can t said maggie treat it as nothing now mrs assingham at this went closer to the cup on the chimney quite liking to feel that she did so moreover without goingcloser to her companion s vision she looked at the preciousthing if precious it was found herself in fact eyeing it as if by her dim solicitation to draw its secret from it rather thansuffer the imposition of maggie s knowledge it was brave andrich and firm with its bold deep hollow and without this queertorment about it would thanks to her love of plenty of yellow figure to her as an enviable ornament a possession reallydesirable she didn t touch it but if after a minute she turnedaway from it the reason was rather oddly and suddenly in herfear of doing so then it all depends on the bowl i mean yourfuture does for that s what it comes to i judge what it comes to maggie presently returned is what thatthing has put me so almost miraculously in the way of learning how far they had originally gone together if there was so muchbetween them before there can t with all the otherappearances not be a great deal more now and she went on andon she steadily made her points if such things were alreadythen between them they make all the difference for possible doubtof what may have been between them since if there had beennothing before there might be explanations but it makes to daytoo much to explain i mean to explain away she said fanny assingham was there to explain away of this she was dulyconscious for that at least had been true up to now in thelight however of maggie s demonstration the quantity evenwithout her taking as yet a more exact measure might well seemlarger than ever besides which with or without exactness theeffect of each successive minute in the place was to put her morein presence of what maggie herself saw maggie herself saw thetruth and that was really while they remained there together enough for mrs assingham s relation to it there was a force inthe princess s mere manner about it that made the detail of whatshe knew a matter of minor importance fanny had in factsomething like a momentary shame over her own need of asking forthis detail i don t pretend to repudiate she said after alittle my own impressions of the different times i suppose youspeak of any more she added than i can forget whatdifficulties and as it constantly seemed to me what dangers every course of action whatever i should decide upon made forme i tried i tried hard to act for the best and you know she next pursued while at the sound of her own statement aslow courage and even a faint warmth of conviction came back toher and you know i believe it s what i shall turn out to havedone this produced a minute during which their interchange thoughquickened and deepened was that of silence only and the long charged look all of which found virtual consecration when maggieat last spoke i m sure you tried to act for the best it kept fanny assingham again a minute in silence i neverthought dearest you weren t an angel not however that this alone was much help it was up to thevery eve you see the princess went on up to within two orthree days of our marriage that that you know and shebroke down for strangely smiling yes as i say it was while she was with me but i didn t knowit that is said fanny assingham i didn t know of anything inparticular it sounded weak that she felt but she had reallyher point to make what i mean is that i don t know forknowledge now anything i didn t then that s how i am shestill however floundered i mean it s how i was but don t they how you were and how you are maggie asked come practically to the same thing the elder woman s words hadstruck her own ear as in the tone now mistimed of their recent but all too factitious understanding arrived at in hours when as there was nothing susceptible of proof there was nothingdefinitely to disprove the situation had changed by well bywhatever there was by the outbreak of the definite and thiscould keep maggie at least firm she was firm enough as shepursued it was on the whole thing that amerigo married me with which her eyes had their turn again at her damnatory piece and it was on that it was on that but they came back to hervisitor and it was on it all that father married her her visitor took it as might be they both married ah that youmust believe with the highest intentions father did certainly and then at the renewal of thisconsciousness it all rolled over her ah to thrust such thingson us to do them here between us and with us day after day andin return in return to do it to him to him to him fanny hesitated you mean it s for him you most suffer andthen as the princess after a look but turned away moving aboutthe room which made the question somehow seem a blunder iask she continued because i think everything everything wenow speak of may be for him really may be made for him quiteas if it hadn t been but maggie had the next moment faced about as if without hearingher father did it for me did it all and only for me mrs assingham with a certain promptness threw up her head butshe faltered again before she spoke well it was only an intended word but maggie showed after an instantthat it had reached her do you mean that that s the reason that that s a reason fanny at first however feeling the response in this didn t sayall she meant she said for the moment something else instead he did it for you largely at least for you and it was for youthat i did in my smaller interested way well what i could do for i could do something she continued i thought i saw yourinterest as he himself saw it and i thought i saw charlotte s ibelieved in her and i believed in her said maggie mrs assingham waited again but she presently pushed on shebelieved then in herself ah maggie murmured something exquisite faintly eager in the prompt simplicity ofit supported her friend further and the prince believed hisbelief was real just as he believed in himself maggie spent a minute in taking it from her he believed inhimself just as i too believed in him for i absolutely did maggie to which fanny then added and i believe in him yet i mean she subjoined well i mean i do maggie again took it from her after which she was again restlessly set afloat then when this had come to an end anddo you believe in charlotte yet mrs assingham had a demur that she felt she could now afford we ll talk of charlotte some other day they both at any rate thought themselves safe at the time then why did they keep from me everything i might have known her friend bent upon her the mildest eyes why did i myself keepit from you oh you weren t for honour obliged dearest maggie the poor woman broke out on this you aredivine they pretended to love me the princess went on and theypretended to love him and pray what was there that i didn t pretend not at any rate to care for me as you cared for amerigo andfor charlotte they were much more interesting it was perfectlynatural how couldn t you like amerigo maggie continued mrs assingham gave it up how couldn t i how couldn t i then with a fine freedom she went all her way how can t i how can t i it fixed afresh maggie s wide eyes on her i see i see well it s beautiful for you to be able to and of course she added you wanted to help charlotte yes fanny considered it i wanted to help charlotte but iwanted also you see to help you by not digging up a past thati believed with so much on top of it solidly buried i wanted as i still want she richly declared to help every one it set maggie once more in movement movement which however spent itself again with a quick emphasis then it s a good dealmy fault if everything really began so well fanny assingham met it as she could you ve been only tooperfect you ve thought only too much but the princess had already caught at the words yes i vethought only too much yet she appeared to continue for theminute full of that fault she had it in fact by this promptedthought all before her of him dear man of him her friend able to take in thus directly her vision of herfather watched her with a new suspense that way might safetylie it was like a wider chink of light he believed with abeauty in charlotte yes and it was i who had made him believe i didn t mean to atthe time so much for i had no idea then of what was coming buti did it i did it the princess declared with a beauty ah with a beauty you too mrs assinghaminsisted maggie however was seeing for herself it was another matter the thing was that he made her think it would be so possible fanny again hesitated the prince made her think maggie stared she had meant her father but her vision seemed tospread they both made her think she wouldn t have thoughtwithout them yet amerigo s good faith mrs assingham insisted wasperfect and there was nothing all the more she added against your father s the remark however kept maggie for a moment still nothingperhaps but his knowing that she knew knew that he was doing it so much for me to what extent shesuddenly asked of her friend do you think he was aware that sheknew ah who can say what passes between people in such a relation the only thing one can be sure of is that he was generous andmrs assingham conclusively smiled he doubtless knew as much aswas right for himself as much that is as was right for her yes then as was right for her the point is fanny declared that whatever his knowledge it made all the way it went forhis good faith maggie continued to gaze and her friend now fairly waited on hersuccessive movements isn t the point very considerably thathis good faith must have been his faith in her taking almost asmuch interest in me as he himself took fanny assingham thought he recognised he adopted your longfriendship but he founded on it no selfishness no said maggie with still deeper consideration he countedher selfishness out almost as he counted his own so you may say very well maggie went on if he had none of his own heinvited her may have expected her on her side to have aslittle and she may only since have found that out mrs assingham looked blank since and he may have become aware maggie pursued that she hasfound it out that she has taken the measure since theirmarriage she explained of how much he had asked of her more say than she had understood at the time he may have made out atlast how such a demand was in the long run to affect her he may have done many things mrs assingham responded butthere s one thing he certainly won t have done he ll never haveshown that he expected of her a quarter as much as she must haveunderstood he was to give i ve often wondered maggie mused what charlotte reallyunderstood but it s one of the things she has never told me then as it s one of the things she has never told me either weshall probably never know it and we may regard it as none of ourbusiness there are many things said mrs assingham that weshall never know maggie took it in with a long reflection never but there are others her friend went on that stare us in theface and that under whatever difficulty you may feel youlabour may now be enough for us your father has beenextraordinary it had been as if maggie were feeling her way but she rallied tothis with a rush extraordinary magnificent said fanny assingham her companion held tight to it magnificent then he ll do for himself whatever there may be to do what heundertook for you he ll do to the end he didn t undertake it tobreak down in what quiet patient exquisite as he is did heever break down he had never in his life proposed to himself tohave failed and he won t have done it on this occasion ah this occasion and maggie s wail showed her of a sudden thrown back on it am i in the least sure that with everything he even knows what it is and yet am i in the least sure hedoesn t if he doesn t then so much the better leave him alone do you mean give him up leave her fanny assingham went on leave her to him maggie looked at her darkly do you mean leave him to her afterthis after everything aren t they for that matter intimatelytogether now intimately how do i know but fanny kept it up aren t you and your husband in spite ofeverything maggie s eyes still further if possible dilated it remains tobe seen if you re not then where s your faith in my husband mrs assingham but for an instant hesitated in your father itall comes back to that rest on it on his ignorance fanny met it again on whatever he may offer you take that take it maggie stared mrs assingham held up her head and be grateful on which fora minute she let the princess face her do you see i see said maggie at last then there you are but maggie had turned away moving to thewindow as if still to keep something in her face from sight shestood there with her eyes on the street while mrs assingham sreverted to that complicating object on the chimney as to whichher condition so oddly even to herself was that both ofrecurrent wonder and recurrent protest she went over it lookedat it afresh and yielded now to her impulse to feel it in herhands she laid them on it lifting it up and was surprised thus with the weight of it she had seldom handled so muchmassive gold that effect itself somehow prompted her to furtherfreedom and presently to saying i don t believe in this youknow it brought maggie round to her don t believe in it you willwhen i tell you ah tell me nothing i won t have it said mrs assingham shekept the cup in her hand held it there in a manner that gavemaggie s attention to her she saw the next moment a quality ofexcited suspense this suggested to her oddly that she had with the liberty she was taking an air of intention and theimpression betrayed by her companion s eyes grew more distinct ina word of warning it s of value but its value s impaired i velearned by a crack a crack in the gold it isn t gold with which somewhat strangely maggie smiled that s the point what is it then it s glass and cracked under the gilt as i say at that glass of this weight well said maggie it s crystal and was once i suppose precious but what she then asked do you mean to do with it she had come away from her window one of the three by which thewide room enjoying an advantageous back commanded the westernsky and caught a glimpse of the evening flush while mrs assingham possessed of the bowl and possessed too of thisindication of a flaw approached another for the benefit of theslowly fading light here thumbing the singular piece weighingit turning it over and growing suddenly more conscious aboveall of an irresistible impulse she presently spoke again acrack then your whole idea has a crack maggie by this time at some distance from her waited a moment if you mean by my idea the knowledge that has come to me that but fanny with decision had already taken her up there s onlyone knowledge that concerns us one fact with which we can haveanything to do which one then the fact that your husband has never never never but thevery gravity of this statement while she raised her eyes to herfriend across the room made her for an instant hang fire well never what never been half so interested in you as now but don t you mydear really feel it maggie considered oh i think what i ve told you helps me tofeel it his having to day given up even his forms his keepingaway from me his not having come and she shook her head asagainst all easy glosses it is because of that you know well then if it s because of this and fanny assingham whohad been casting about her and whose inspiration decidedly hadcome raised the cup in her two hands raised it positively aboveher head and from under it solemnly smiled at the princess asa signal of intention so for an instant full of her thought andof her act she held the precious vessel and then with due notetaken of the margin of the polished floor bare fine and hard inthe embrasure of her window she dashed it boldly to the ground where she had the thrill of seeing it with the violence of thecrash lie shattered she had flushed with the force of hereffort as maggie had flushed with wonder at the sight and thishigh reflection in their faces was all that passed between themfor a minute more after which whatever you meant by it and idon t want to know now has ceased to exist mrs assinghamsaid and what in the world my dear did you mean by it thatsound as at the touch of a spring rang out as the first effectof fanny s speech it broke upon the two women s absorption witha sharpness almost equal to the smash of the crystal for thedoor of the room had been opened by the prince without theirtaking heed he had apparently had time moreover to catch theconclusion of fanny s act his eyes attached themselves throughthe large space allowing just there as happened a free view tothe shining fragments at this lady s feet his question had beenaddressed to his wife but he moved his eyes immediatelyafterwards to those of her visitor whose own then held them in amanner of which neither party had been capable doubtless formute penetration since the hour spent by him in cadogan place onthe eve of his marriage and the afternoon of charlotte sreappearance something now again became possible for thesecommunicants under the intensity of their pressure somethingthat took up that tale and that might have been a redemption ofpledges then exchanged this rapid play of suppressed appeal anddisguised response lasted indeed long enough for more resultsthan one long enough for mrs assingham to measure the feat ofquick self recovery possibly therefore of recognition still moreimmediate accompanying amerigo s vision and estimate of theevidence with which she had been so admirably she felt as shelooked at him inspired to deal she looked at him and looked athim there were so many things she wanted on the spot to say but maggie was looking too and was moreover looking at themboth so that these things for the elder woman quickly enoughreduced themselves to one she met his question not too late since in their silence it had remained in the air gatheringherself to go leaving the golden bowl split into three pieces onthe ground she simply referred him to his wife she should seethem later they would all meet soon again and meanwhile as towhat maggie had meant she said in her turn from the door why maggie herself was doubtless by this time ready to tell him xxxivleft with her husband maggie however for the time saidnothing she only felt on the spot a strong sharp wish not tosee his face again till he should have had a minute to arrangeit she had seen it enough for her temporary clearness and hernext movement seen it as it showed during the stare of surprisethat followed his entrance then it was that she knew how hugelyexpert she had been made for judging it quickly by that visionof it indelibly registered for reference that had flashed alight into her troubled soul the night of his late return frommatcham the expression worn by it at that juncture for howeverfew instants had given her a sense of its possibilities one ofthe most relevant of which might have been playing up for her before the consummation of fanny assingham s retreat just longenough to be recognised what she had recognised in it was hisrecognition the result of his having been forced by the flushof their visitor s attitude and the unextinguished report of herwords to take account of the flagrant signs of the accident ofthe incident on which he had unexpectedly dropped he had notunnaturally failed to see this occurrence represented by thethree fragments of an object apparently valuable which lay thereon the floor and which even across the width of the room hiskept interval reminded him unmistakably though confusedly ofsomething known some other unforgotten image that was a mereshock that was a pain as if fanny s violence had been aviolence redoubled and acting beyond its intention a violencecalling up the hot blood as a blow across the mouth might havecalled it maggie knew as she turned away from him that shedidn t want his pain what she wanted was her own simplecertainty not the red mark of conviction flaming there in hisbeauty if she could have gone on with bandaged eyes she wouldhave liked that best if it were a question of saying what shenow apparently should have to and of taking from him what hewould say any blindness that might wrap it would be the nearestapproach to a boon she went in silence to where her friend never in intention visibly so much her friend as at that moment had braced herselfto so amazing an energy and there under amerigo s eyes shepicked up the shining pieces bedizened and jewelled in herrustling finery she paid with humility of attitude this prompttribute to order only to find however that she could carry buttwo of the fragments at once she brought them over to thechimney piece to the conspicuous place occupied by the cupbefore fanny s appropriation of it and after laying themcarefully down went back for what remained the solid detachedfoot with this she returned to the mantel shelf placing it withdeliberation in the centre and then for a minute occupyingherself as with the attempt to fit the other morsels after shehad squared again her little objects on the chimney she waswithin an ace in fact of turning on him with that appeal besides its being lucid for her all the while that the occasionwas passing that they were dining out that he wasn t dressed and that though she herself was she was yet in allprobability so horribly red in the face and so awry in manyways with agitation that in view of the ambassador s company of possible comments and constructions she should need beforeher glass some restoration of appearances amerigo meanwhile after all could clearly make the most of herhaving enjoined on him to wait suggested it by the positive pompof her dealings with the smashed cup to wait that is till sheshould pronounce as mrs assingham had promised for her thisdelay again certainly tested her presence of mind though thatstrain was not what presently made her speak keep her eyes forthe time from her husband s as she might she soon found herselfmuch more drivingly conscious of the strain on his own wit therewas even a minute when her back was turned to him during whichshe knew once more the strangeness of her desire to spare him astrangeness that had already fifty times brushed her in thedepth of her trouble as with the wild wing of some bird of theair who might blindly have swooped for an instant into the shaftof a well darkening there by his momentary flutter the far offround of sky it was extraordinary this quality in the taste ofher wrong which made her completed sense of it seem rather tosoften than to harden and it was the more extraordinary the moreshe had to recognise it for what it came to was that seeingherself finally sure knowing everything having the fact in allits abomination so utterly before her that there was nothingelse to add what it came to was that merely by being with himthere in silence she felt within her the sudden split betweenconviction and action they had begun to cease on the spot surprisingly to be connected conviction that is budged noinch only planting its feet the more firmly in the soil butaction began to hover like some lighter and larger but easierform excited by its very power to keep above ground it would befree it would be independent it would go in wouldn t it forsome prodigious and superior adventure of its own what wouldcondemn it so to speak to the responsibility of freedom thisglimmered on maggie even now was the possibility richer withevery lapsing moment that her husband would have on the wholequestion a new need of her a need which was in fact being bornbetween them in these very seconds it struck her truly as so newthat he would have felt hitherto none to compare with it at all would indeed absolutely by this circumstance be really needingher for the first one in their whole connection no he had usedher had even exceedingly enjoyed her before this but there hadbeen no precedent for that character of a proved necessity to himwhich she was rapidly taking on the immense advantage of thisparticular clue moreover was that she should have now toarrange alter to falsify nothing should have to be butconsistently simple and straight she asked herself withconcentration while her back was still presented what would bethe very ideal of that method after which the next instant ithad all come to her and she had turned round upon him for theapplication fanny assingham broke it knowing it had a crackand that it would go if she used sufficient force she thought when i had told her that that would be the best thing to do withit thought so from her own point of view that hadn t been atall my idea but she acted before i understood i had on thecontrary she explained put it here in full view exactlythat you might see he stood with his hands in his pockets he had carried his eyesto the fragments on the chimney piece and she could alreadydistinguish the element of relief absolutely of succour in hisacceptance from her of the opportunity to consider the fruits oftheir friend s violence every added inch of reflection and delayhaving the advantage from this point on of counting for himdouble it had operated within her now to the last intensity herglimpse of the precious truth that by her helping him helpinghim to help himself as it were she should help him to help her hadn t she fairly got into his labyrinth with him wasn t sheindeed in the very act of placing herself there for him at itscentre and core whence on that definite orientation and by aninstinct all her own she might securely guide him out of it sheoffered him thus assuredly a kind of support that was not tohave been imagined in advance and that moreover required ahmost truly some close looking at before it could be believed inand pronounced void of treachery yes look look she seemedto see him hear her say even while her sounded words were other look look both at the truth that still survives in thatsmashed evidence and at the even more remarkable appearance thati m not such a fool as you supposed me look at the possibilitythat since i am different there may still be something in itfor you if you re capable of working with me to get that out consider of course as you must the question of what you mayhave to surrender on your side what price you may have to pay whom you may have to pay with to set this advantage free buttake in at any rate that there is something for you if youdon t too blindly spoil your chance for it he went no nearerthe damnatory pieces but he eyed them from where he stood witha degree of recognition just visibly less to be dissimulated allof which represented for her a certain traceable process and heruttered words meanwhile were different enough from those hemight have inserted between the lines of her already spoken it s the golden bowl you know that you saw at the littleantiquario s in bloomsbury so long ago when you went there withcharlotte when you spent those hours with her unknown to me aday or two before our marriage it was shown you both but youdidn t take it you left it for me and i came upon it extraordinarily through happening to go into the same shop onmonday last in walking home in prowling about to pick up somesmall old thing for father s birthday after my visit to themuseum my appointment there with mr crichton of which i toldyou it was shown me and i was struck with it and took it knowing nothing about it at the time what i now know i velearned since i learned this afternoon a couple of hours ago receiving from it naturally a great impression so there it is in its three pieces you can handle them don t be afraid if youwant to make sure the thing is the thing you and charlotte sawtogether its having come apart makes an unfortunate differencefor its beauty its artistic value but none for anything else its other value is just the same i mean that of its having givenme so much of the truth about you i don t therefore so much carewhat becomes of it now unless perhaps you may yourself when youcome to think have some good use for it in that case maggiewound up we can easily take the pieces with us to fawns it was wonderful how she felt by the time she had seen herselfthrough this narrow pass that she had really achievedsomething that she was emerging a little in fine with theprospect less contracted she had done for him that is what herinstinct enjoined had laid a basis not merely momentary on whichhe could meet her when by the turn of his head he did finallymeet her this was the last thing that glimmered out of his look but it came into sight none the less as a perception of hisdistress and almost as a question of his eyes so that for stillanother minute before he committed himself there occurredbetween them a kind of unprecedented moral exchange over whichher superior lucidity presided it was not however that when hedid commit himself the show was promptly portentous but what inthe world has fanny assingham had to do with it she could verily out of all her smothered soreness almost havesmiled his question so affected her as giving the whole thing upto her but it left her only to go the straighter she has hadto do with it that i immediately sent for her and that sheimmediately came she was the first person i wanted to see because i knew she would know know more about what i hadlearned i mean than i could make out for myself i made out asmuch as i could for myself that i also wanted to have done butit didn t in spite of everything take me very far and she hasreally been a help not so much as she would like to be not somuch as poor dear she just now tried to be yet she has doneher very best for you never forget that and has kept me alongimmeasurably better than i should have been able to come withouther she has gained me time and that these three months don tyou see has been everything she had said don t you see on purpose and was to feel thenext moment that it had acted these three months the princeasked counting from the night you came home so late from matcham counting from the hours you spent with charlotte at gloucester your visit to the cathedral which you won t have forgottendescribing to me in so much detail for that was the beginning ofmy being sure before it i had been sufficiently in doubt sure maggie developed of your having and of your having for a longtime had two relations with charlotte he stared a little at sea as he took it up two something in the tone of it gave it a sense or an ambiguity almost foolish leaving maggie to feel as in a flash how such aconsequence a foredoomed infelicity partaking of the ridiculouseven in one of the cleverest might be of the very essence of thepenalty of wrong doing oh you may have had fifty had the samerelation with her fifty times it s of the number of kinds ofrelation with her that i speak a number that doesn t matter really so long as there wasn t only one kind as father and isupposed one kind she went on was there before us we tookthat fully for granted as you saw and accepted it we neverthought of there being another kept out of our sight but afterthe evening i speak of i knew there was something else as i say i had before that my idea which you never dreamed i had fromthe moment i speak of it had more to go upon and you becameyourselves you and she vaguely yet uneasily conscious of thedifference but it s within these last hours that i ve most seenwhere we are and as i ve been in communication with fannyassingham about my doubts so i wanted to let her know mycertainty with the determination of which however you mustunderstand she has had nothing to do she defends you maggieremarked he had given her all his attention and with this impression forher again that he was in essence fairly reaching out to herfor time time only time she could sufficiently imagine and towhatever strangeness that he absolutely liked her to talk evenat the cost of his losing almost everything else by it it wasstill for a minute as if he waited for something worse wantedeverything that was in her to come out any definite fact anything more precisely nameable so that he too as was hisright should know where he was what stirred in him above all while he followed in her face the clear train of her speech musthave been the impulse to take up something she put before himthat he was yet afraid directly to touch he wanted to make freewith it but had to keep his hands off for reasons he hadalready made out and the discomfort of his privation yearned ather out of his eyes with an announcing gleam of the fever thenone too tolerable chill of specific recognition she affectedhim as speaking more or less for her father as well and his eyesmight have been trying to hypnotise her into giving him theanswer without his asking the question had he his idea and hashe now with you anything more those were the words he had tohold himself from not speaking and that she would as yet certainly do nothing to make easy she felt with her sharpestthrill how he was straitened and tied and with the miserablepity of it her present conscious purpose of keeping him so couldnone the less perfectly accord to name her father on any suchbasis of anxiety of compunction would be to do the impossiblething to do neither more nor less than give charlotte away visibly palpably traceably he stood off from this movedback from it as from an open chasm now suddenly perceived butwhich had been between the two with so much so strangely muchelse quite uncalculated verily it towered before her thishistory of their confidence they had built strong and piledhigh based as it was on such appearances their conviction that thanks to her native complacencies of so many sorts she wouldalways quite to the end and through and through take them asnobly sparing her amerigo was at any rate having the sensationof a particular ugliness to avoid a particular difficulty tocount with that practically found him as unprepared as if he hadbeen like his wife an abjectly simple person and shemeanwhile however abjectly simple was further discerning forherself that whatever he might have to take from her shebeing on her side beautifully free he would absolutely not beable for any qualifying purpose to name charlotte either ashis father in law s wife mrs verver rose between them there forthe time in august and prohibitive form to protect her defendher explain about her was at the least to bring her into thequestion which would be by the same stroke to bring her husband but this was exactly the door maggie wouldn t open to him on allof which she was the next moment asking herself if thus warnedand embarrassed he were not fairly writhing in his pain hewrithed on that hypothesis some seconds more for it was nottill then that he had chosen between what he could do and what hecouldn t you re apparently drawing immense conclusions from very smallmatters won t you perhaps feel in fairness that you restriking out triumphing or whatever i may call it rather tooeasily feel it when i perfectly admit that your smashed cupthere does come back to me i frankly confess now to theoccasion and to having wished not to speak of it to you at thetime we took two or three hours together by arrangement it wason the eve of my marriage at the moment you say but that put iton the eve of yours too my dear which was directly the point it was desired to find for you at the eleventh hour some smallwedding present a hunt for something worth giving you and yetpossible from other points of view as well in which it seemed icould be of use you were naturally not to be told preciselybecause it was all for you we went forth together and we looked we rummaged about and as i remember we called it we prowled then it was that as i freely recognise we came across thatcrystal cup which i m bound to say upon my honour i think itrather a pity fanny assingham from whatever good motive shouldhave treated so he had kept his hands in his pockets he turnedhis eyes again but more complacently now to the ruins of theprecious vessel and maggie could feel him exhale into theachieved quietness of his explanation a long deep breath ofcomparative relief behind everything beneath everything it wassomehow a comfort to him at last to be talking with her and heseemed to be proving to himself that he could talk it was at alittle shop in bloomsbury i think i could go to the place now the man understood italian i remember he wanted awfully to workoff his bowl but i didn t believe in it and we didn t take it maggie had listened with an interest that wore all the expressionof candour oh you left it for me but what did you take he looked at her first as if he were trying to remember then asif he might have been trying to forget nothing i think atthat place what did you take then at any other what did you get me sincethat was your aim and end for a wedding gift the prince continued very nobly to bethink himself didn t weget you anything maggie waited a little she had for some time now kept her eyeson him steadily but they wandered at this to the fragments onher chimney yes it comes round after all to your having gotme the bowl i myself was to come upon it the other day by sowonderful a chance was to find it in the same place and to haveit pressed upon me by the same little man who does as you say understand italian i did believe in it you see must havebelieved in it somehow instinctively for i took it as soon as isaw it though i didn t know at all then she added what i wastaking with it the prince paid her for an instant visibly the deference oftrying to imagine what this might have been i agree with youthat the coincidence is extraordinary the sort of thing thathappens mainly in novels and plays but i don t see you must letme say the importance or the connexion of my having made the purchase where you failed of it she hadquickly taken him up but she had with her eyes on him oncemore another drop into the order of her thoughts to which through whatever he might say she was still adhering it s notmy having gone into the place at the end of four years thatmakes the strangeness of the coincidence for don t such chancesas that in london easily occur the strangeness she lucidlysaid is in what my purchase was to represent to me after i hadgot it home which value came she explained from the wonderof my having found such a friend such a friend as a wonder assuredly her husband could buttake it as the little man in the shop he did for me more than he knew i owe it to him he took an interest in me maggie said and taking that interest he recalled your visit he remembered youand spoke of you to me on which the prince passed the comment of a sceptical smile ahbut my dear if extraordinary things come from people s takingan interest in you my life in that case she asked must be very agitated well he liked me i mean very particularly it s only so i canaccount for my afterwards hearing from him and in fact he gaveme that to day she pursued he gave me it frankly as hisreason to day the prince inquiringly echoed but she was singularly able it had been marvellously given her she afterwards said to herself to abide for her light forher clue by her own order i inspired him with sympathy there you are but the miracle isthat he should have a sympathy to offer that could be of use tome that was really the oddity of my chance the princessproceeded that i should have been moved in my ignorance to goprecisely to him he saw her so keep her course that it was as if he could at thebest but stand aside to watch her and let her pass he only madea vague demonstration that was like an ineffective gesture i msorry to say any ill of your friends and the thing was a longtime ago besides which there was nothing to make me recur to it but i remember the man s striking me as a decided little beast she gave a slow headshake as if no after consideration notthat way were an issue i can only think of him as kind for hehad nothing to gain he had in fact only to lose it was what hecame to tell me that he had asked me too high a price more thanthe object was really worth there was a particular reason whichhe hadn t mentioned and which had made him consider and repent he wrote for leave to see me again wrote in such terms that isaw him here this afternoon here it made the prince look about him downstairs in the little red room while he was waiting helooked at the few photographs that stand about there andrecognised two of them though it was so long ago he rememberedthe visit made him by the lady and the gentleman and that gavehim his connexion it gave me mine for he remembered everythingand told me everything you see you too had produced your effect only unlike you he had thought of it again he had recurred toit he told me of your having wished to make each otherpresents but of that s not having come off the lady was greatlytaken with the piece i had bought of him but you had your reasonagainst receiving it from her and you had been right he wouldthink that of you more than ever now maggie went on he wouldsee how wisely you had guessed the flaw and how easily the bowlcould be broken i had bought it myself you see for apresent he knew i was doing that this was what had worked inhim especially after the price i had paid her story had dropped an instant she still brought it out insmall waves of energy each of which spent its force so that hehad an opportunity to speak before this force was renewed butthe quaint thing was what he now said and what pray was theprice she paused again a little it was high certainly for thosefragments i think i feel as i look at them there ratherashamed to say the prince then again looked at them he might have been growingused to the sight but shall you at least get your money back oh i m far from wanting it back i feel so that i m getting itsworth with which before he could reply she had a quicktransition the great fact about the day we re talking of seemsto me to have been quite remarkably that no present was thenmade me if your undertaking had been for that that was not atleast what came of it you received then nothing at all the prince looked vague andgrave almost retrospectively concerned nothing but an apology for empty hands and empty pockets whichwas made me as if it mattered a mite ever so frankly ever sobeautifully and touchingly this amerigo heard with interest yet not with confusion ah ofcourse you couldn t have minded distinctly as she went on hewas getting the better of the mere awkwardness of his arrest quite as if making out that he need suffer arrest from her now before they should go forth to show themselves in the worldtogether in no greater quantity than an occasion ill chosen atthe best for a scene might decently make room for he looked athis watch their engagement all the while remained before him but i don t make out you see what case against me yourest on everything i m telling you why the whole case the case ofyour having for so long so successfully deceived me the idea ofyour finding something for me charming as that would have been was what had least to do with your taking a morning together atthat moment what had really to do with it said maggie wasthat you had to you couldn t not from the moment you were againface to face and the reason of that was that there had been somuch between you before before i came between you at all her husband had been for these last moments moving about underher eyes but at this as to check any show of impatience heagain stood still you ve never been more sacred to me than youwere at that hour unless perhaps you ve become so at this one the assurance of his speech she could note quite held up itshead in him his eyes met her own so for the declaration thatit was as if something cold and momentarily unimaginable breathedupon her from afar off out of his strange consistency she kepther direction still however under that oh the thing i veknown best of all is that you ve never wanted together tooffend us you ve wanted quite intensely not to and theprecautions you ve had to take for it have been for a long timeone of the strongest of my impressions that i think sheadded is the way i ve best known known he repeated after a moment known known that you were older friends and so much moreintimate ones than i had any reason to suppose when we married known there were things that hadn t been told me and that gavetheir meaning little by little to other things that were beforeme would they have made a difference in the matter of ourmarriage the prince presently asked if you had known them she took her time to think i grant you not in the matter ofours and then as he again fixed her with his hard yearning which he couldn t keep down the question is so much bigger thanthat you see how much what i know makes of it for me that waswhat acted on him this iteration of her knowledge into thequestion of the validity of the various bearings of which hecouldn t on the spot trust himself to pretend in any high way to go what her claim as she made it represented for him thathe couldn t help betraying if only as a consequence of theeffect of the word itself her repeated distinct know know onhis nerves she was capable of being sorry for his nerves at atime when he should need them for dining out pompously ratherresponsibly without his heart in it yet she was not to let thatprevent her using with all economy so precious a chance forsupreme clearness i didn t force this upon you you mustrecollect and it probably wouldn t have happened for you if youhadn t come in ah said the prince i was liable to come in you know i didn t think you were this evening and why not well she answered you have many liabilities of differentsorts with which she recalled what she had said to fannyassingham and then you re so deep it produced in his features in spite of his control of them oneof those quick plays of expression the shade of a grimace thattestified as nothing else did to his race it s you cara whoare deep which after an instant she had accepted from him she could sofeel at last that it was true then i shall have need of itall but what would you have done he was by this time asking if ihadn t come in i don t know she had hesitated what would you oh io that isn t the question i depend upon you i go on youwould have spoken to morrow i think i would have waited and for what he asked to see what difference it would make for myself my possessionat last i mean of real knowledge oh said the prince my only point now at any rate she went on is thedifference as i say that it may make for you your knowingwas from the moment you did come in all i had in view and shesounded it again he should have it once more your knowing thati ve ceased that you ve ceased with her pause in fact she had fairlymade him press her for it why to be as i was not to know it was once more then after a little that he had had to standreceptive yet the singular effect of this was that there wasstill something of the same sort he was made to want he hadanother hesitation but at last this odd quantity showed thendoes any one else know it was as near as he could come to naming her father and shekept him at that distance any one any one i mean but fanny assingham i should have supposed you had had by this time particular meansof learning i don t see she said why you ask me then after an instant and only after an instant as she saw hemade out what she meant and it gave her all strangely enough the still further light that charlotte for herself knew aslittle as he had known the vision loomed in this light itfairly glared for the few seconds the vision of the two othersalone together at fawns and charlotte as one of them havinggropingly to go on always not knowing and not knowing thepicture flushed at the same time with all its essential colour that of the so possible identity of her father s motive andprinciple with her own he was deep as amerigo called it sothat no vibration of the still air should reach his daughter just as she had earned that description by making and by forthat matter intending still to make her care for his serenity or at any rate for the firm outer shell of his dignity allmarvellous enamel her paramount law more strangely even thananything else her husband seemed to speak now but to help her inthis i know nothing but what you tell me then i ve told you all i intended find out the rest find it out he waited she stood before him a moment it took that time to go on depthupon depth of her situation as she met his face surged and sankwithin her but with the effect somehow once more that theyrather lifted her than let her drop she had her feet somewhere through it all it was her companion absolutely who was at sea and she kept her feet she pressed them to what was beneath her she went over to the bell beside the chimney and gave a ring thathe could but take as a summons for her maid it stoppedeverything for the present it was an intimation to him to go anddress but she had to insist find out for yourself part fifthxxxvafter the little party was again constituted at fawns which hadtaken for completeness some ten days maggie naturally feltherself still more possessed in spirit of everything that hadlast happened in london there was a phrase that came back to herfrom old american years she was having by that idiom the timeof her life she knew it by the perpetual throb of this sense ofpossession which was almost too violent either to recognise orto hide it was as if she had come out that was her most generalconsciousness out of a dark tunnel a dense wood or even simplya smoky room and had thereby at least for going on theadvantage of air in her lungs it was as if she were somehow atlast gathering in the fruits of patience she had either beenreally more patient than she had known at the time or had beenso for longer the change brought about by itself as great adifference of view as the shift of an inch in the position of atelescope it was her telescope in fact that had gained inrange just as her danger lay in her exposing herself to theobservation by the more charmed and therefore the more reckless use of this optical resource not under any provocation toproduce it in public was her unremitted rule but thedifficulties of duplicity had not shrunk while the need of ithad doubled humbugging which she had so practised with herfather had been a comparatively simple matter on the basis ofmere doubt but the ground to be covered was now greatly larger and she felt not unlike some young woman of the theatre who engaged for a minor part in the play and having mastered her cueswith anxious effort should find herself suddenly promoted toleading lady and expected to appear in every act of the five shehad made much to her husband that last night of her knowing but it was exactly this quantity she now knew that from themoment she could only dissimulate it added to her responsibilityand made of the latter all a mere question of havingsomething precious and precarious in charge there was no one tohelp her with it not even fanny assingham now this goodfriend s presence having become inevitably with that climax oftheir last interview in portland place a severely simplifiedfunction she had her use oh yes a thousand times but it couldonly consist henceforth in her quite conspicuously touching at nopoint whatever assuredly at least with maggie the matter theyhad discussed she was there inordinately as a value but as avalue only for the clear negation of everything she was theirgeneral sign precisely of unimpaired beatitude and she was tolive up to that somewhat arduous character poor thing as shemight she might privately lapse from it if she must withamerigo or with charlotte only not of course ever so much asfor the wink of an eye with the master of the house such lapseswould be her own affair which maggie at present could take nothought of she treated her young friend meanwhile it was to besaid to no betrayal of such wavering so that from the moment ofher alighting at the door with the colonel everything went onbetween them at concert pitch what had she done that lastevening in maggie s room but bring the husband and wife moretogether than as would seem they had ever been therefore whatindiscretion should she not show by attempting to go behind thegrand appearance of her success which would be to court a doubtof her beneficent work she knew accordingly nothing but harmonyand diffused restlessly nothing but peace an extravagant expressive aggressive peace not incongruous after all withthe solid calm of the place a kind of helmetted trident shakingpax britannica the peace it must be added had become as the days elapsed apeace quite generally animated and peopled thanks to that factof the presence of company in which maggie s ability topreserve an appearance had learned from so far back to find itsbest resource it was not inconspicuous it was in fact striking that this resource just now seemed to meet in the highestdegree every one s need quite as if every one were by themultiplication of human objects in the scene by the creation bythe confusion of fictive issues hopeful of escaping somebodyelse s notice it had reached the point in truth that thecollective bosom might have been taken to heave with theknowledge of the descent upon adjacent shores for a shortperiod of mrs rance and the lutches still united and still sodivided for conquest the sense of the party showed at least oddly enough as favourable to the fancy of the quaint turn thatsome near week end might derive from their reappearance thismeasured for maggie the ground they had all travelled togethersince that unforgotten afternoon of the none so distant year that determinant september sunday when sitting with her fatherin the park as in commemoration of the climax both of their oldorder and of their old danger she had proposed to him that theyshould call in charlotte call her in as a specialist might besummoned to an invalid s chair wasn t it a sign of somethingrather portentous their being ready to be beholden as for adiversion to the once despised kitty and dotty that had alreadyhad its application in truth to her invocation of thecastledeans and several other members again of the historicmatcham week made before she left town and made alwaysconsistently with an idea since she was never henceforth toapproach these people without an idea and since that luridelement of their intercourse grew and grew for her with eachoccasion the flame with which it burned afresh during theseparticular days the way it held up the torch to anything toeverything that might have occurred as the climax of revelsspringing from traditions so vivified this by itself justifiedher private motive and reconsecrated her diplomacy she hadalready produced by the aid of these people something of theeffect she sought that of being good for whatever hercompanions were good for and of not asking either of them togive up anyone or anything for her sake there was moreover frankly a sharpness of point in it that she enjoyed it gave anaccent to the truth she wished to illustrate the truth that thesurface of her recent life thick sown with the flower of earnestendeavour with every form of the unruffled and the undoubting suffered no symptom anywhere to peep out it was as if under herpressure neither party could get rid of the complicity as itmight be figured of the other as if in a word she saw amerigoand charlotte committed for fear of betrayals on their own side to a kind of wan consistency on the subject of lady castledean s set and this latter group by the same stroke compelled toassist at attestations the extent and bearing of which theyrather failed to grasp and which left them indeed in spite ofhereditary high spirits a trifle bewildered and even a triflescared they made none the less at fawns for number for movement forsound they played their parts during a crisis that must havehovered for them in the long passages of the old house afterthe fashion of the established ghost felt through the darkhours as a constant possibility rather than have menaced them inthe form of a daylight bore one of the perceived outsiders whoare liable to be met in the drawing room or to be sat next to atdinner if the princess moreover had failed of her occult usefor so much of the machinery of diversion she would still havehad a sense not other than sympathetic for the advantage nowextracted from it by fanny assingham s bruised philosophy thisgood friend s relation to it was actually the revanche shesufficiently indicated of her obscured lustre at matcham whereshe had known her way about so much less than most of the others she knew it at fawns through the pathless wild of the righttone positively better than any one maggie could note for her and her revenge had the magnanimity of a brave pointing out of itto every one else a wonderful irresistible conscious almostcompassionate patronage here was a house she triumphantlycaused it to be noted in which she so bristled with values thatsome of them might serve by her amused willingness to share forsuch of the temporarily vague among her fellow guests such ofthe dimly disconcerted as had lost the key to their own it mayhave been partly through the effect of this especial strain ofcommunity with her old friend that maggie found herself oneevening moved to take up again their dropped directness ofreference they had remained downstairs together late the otherwomen of the party had filed singly or in couples up the grand staircase on which from the equally grand hall theseretreats and advances could always be pleasantly observed themen had apparently taken their way to the smoking room while theprincess in possession thus of a rare reach of view hadlingered as if to enjoy it then she saw that mrs assingham wasremaining a little and as for the appreciation of her enjoyment upon which they stood looking at each other across the clearedprospect until the elder woman only vaguely expressive andtentative now came nearer it was like the act of asking ifthere were anything she could yet do and that question wasanswered by her immediately feeling on this closer view as shehad felt when presenting herself in portland place after maggie slast sharp summons their understanding was taken up by these newsnatched moments where that occasion had left it he has never told her that i know of that i m at lastsatisfied and then as mrs assingham opened wide eyes i vebeen in the dark since we came down not understanding what hehas been doing or intending not making out what can have passedbetween them but within a day or two i ve begun to suspect andthis evening for reasons oh too many to tell you i ve beensure since it explains nothing has passed between them that swhat has happened it explains the princess repeated withenergy it explains it explains she spoke in a manner thather auditor was afterwards to describe to the colonel oddlyenough as that of the quietest excitement she had turned backto the chimney place where in honour of a damp day and a chillnight the piled logs had turned to flame and sunk to embers andthe evident intensity of her vision for the fact she impartedmade fanny assingham wait upon her words it explained thisstriking fact more indeed than her companion though consciousof fairly gaping with good will could swallow at once theprincess however as for indulgence and confidence quicklyfilled up the measure he hasn t let her know that i know and clearly doesn t mean to he has made up his mind he ll saynothing about it therefore as she s quite unable to arrive atthe knowledge by herself she has no idea how much i m really inpossession she believes said maggie and so far as her ownconviction goes she knows that i m not in possession ofanything and that somehow for my own help seems to meimmense immense my dear mrs assingham applausively murmured thoughnot quite even as yet seeing all the way he s keeping quietthen on purpose on purpose maggie s lighted eyes at least looked furtherthan they had ever looked he ll never tell her now fanny wondered she cast about her most of all she admired herlittle friend in whom this announcement was evidently animatedby an heroic lucidity she stood there in her full uniform likesome small erect commander of a siege an anxious captain who hassuddenly got news replete with importance for him of agitation of division within the place this importance breathed upon hercomrade so you re all right oh all right s a good deal to say but i seem at least to see as i haven t before where i am with it fanny bountifully brooded there was a point left vague and youhave it from him your husband himself has told you told me why what you speak of it isn t of an assurance received fromhim then that you do speak at which maggie had continued to stare dear me no do yousuppose i ve asked him for an assurance ah you haven t her companion smiled that s what i supposedyou might mean then darling what have you asked him for i ve asked him for nothing but this in turn made fanny stare then nothing that eveningof the embassy dinner passed between you on the contrary everything passed everything everything i told him what i knew and i told him how i knewit mrs assingham waited and that was all wasn t it quite enough oh love she bridled that s for you to have judged then i have judged said maggie i did judge i made sure heunderstood then i let him alone mrs assingham wondered but he didn t explain explain thank god no maggie threw back her head as with horror at the thought then the next moment added and i didn t either the decency of pride in it shed a cold little light yet as fromheights at the base of which her companion rather panted but ifhe neither denies nor confesses he does what s a thousand times better he lets it alone hedoes maggie went on as he would do as i see now that i wassure he would he lets me alone fanny assingham turned it over then how do you know so where as you say you are why just by that i put him in possession of the difference the difference made about me by the fact that i hadn t been after all though with a wonderful chance i admitted helpingme too stupid to have arrived at knowledge he had to see thati m changed for him quite changed from the idea of me that hehad so long been going on with it became a question then of hisreally taking in the change and what i now see is that he isdoing so fanny followed as she could which he shows by letting you asyou say alone maggie looked at her a minute and by letting her mrs assingham did what she might to embrace it checked alittle however by a thought that was the nearest approach shecould have in this almost too large air to an inspiration ah but does charlotte let him oh that s another affair with which i ve practically nothingto do i dare say however she doesn t and the princess had amore distant gaze for the image evoked by the question i don tin fact well see how she can but the point for me is that heunderstands yes fanny assingham cooed understands well what i want i want a happiness without a hole in it bigenough for you to poke in your finger a brilliant perfect surface to begin with at least i see the golden bowl as it was to have been and maggie dweltmusingly on this obscured figure the bowl with all ourhappiness in it the bowl without the crack for mrs assingham too the image had its force and the preciousobject shone before her again reconstituted plausible presentable but wasn t there still a piece missing yet if helets you alone and you only let him mayn t our doing so you mean be noticed mayn t it give usaway well we hope not we try not we take such care we aloneknow what s between us we and you and haven t you preciselybeen struck since you ve been here maggie asked with ourmaking so good a show her friend hesitated to your father but it made her hesitate too she wouldn t speak of her fatherdirectly to everyone to her now that you understand it held poor fanny again in wonder to charlotte yes ifthere s so much beneath it for you and if it s all such a plan that makes it hang together it makes you hang together shefairly exhaled her admiration you re like nobody else you reextraordinary maggie met it with appreciation but with a reserve no i m notextraordinary but i am for every one quiet well that s just what is extraordinary quiet is more than i am and you leave me far behind with which again for aninstant mrs assingham frankly brooded now that iunderstand you say but there s one thing i don t understand and the next minute while her companion waited she hadmentioned it how can charlotte after all not have pressedhim not have attacked him about it how can she not have askedhim asked him on his honour i mean if you know how can she not why of course said the princess limpidly she must well then well then you think he must have told her why exactly what imean said maggie is that he will have done nothing of thesort will as i say have maintained the contrary fanny assingham weighed it under her direct appeal for thetruth under her direct appeal for the truth her appeal to his honour her appeal to his honour that s my point fanny assingham braved it for the truth as from him to her from him to any one mrs assingham s face lighted he ll simply he ll insistentlyhave lied maggie brought it out roundly he ll simply he ll insistentlyhave lied it held again her companion who next however with a singlemovement throwing herself on her neck overflowed oh if youknew how you help me maggie had liked her to understand so far as this was possible but had not been slow to see afterwards how the possibility waslimited when one came to think by mysteries she was not tosound this inability in her was indeed not remarkable inasmuchas the princess herself as we have seen was only now in aposition to boast of touching bottom maggie lived inwardly ina consciousness that she could but partly open even to so good afriend and her own visitation of the fuller expanse of whichwas for that matter still going on they had been duskierstill however these recesses of her imagination that nodoubt was what might at present be said for them she had lookedinto them on the eve of her leaving town almost withoutpenetration she had made out in those hours and also of atruth during the days which immediately followed little morethan the strangeness of a relation having for its chief mark whether to be prolonged or not the absence of any intimate result of the crisis she had invited her husband to recognise they had dealt with this crisis again face to face verybriefly the morning after the scene in her room but with theodd consequence of her having appeared merely to leave it on hishands he had received it from her as he might have received abunch of keys or a list of commissions attentive to herinstructions about them but only putting them for the time very carefully and safely into his pocket the instructions hadseemed from day to day to make so little difference for hisbehaviour that is for his speech or his silence to produce asyet so little of the fruit of action he had taken from her onthe spot in a word before going to dress for dinner all shethen had to give after which on the morrow he had asked herfor more a good deal as if she might have renewed her supplyduring the night but he had had at his command for this latterpurpose an air of extraordinary detachment and discretion an airamounting really to an appeal which if she could have broughtherself to describe it vulgarly she would have described ascool just as he himself would have described it in any one elseas cheeky a suggestion that she should trust him on theparticular ground since she didn t on the general neither hisspeech nor his silence struck her as signifying more or less under this pressure than they had seemed to signify for weekspast yet if her sense hadn t been absolutely closed to thepossibility in him of any thought of wounding her she might havetaken his undisturbed manner the perfection of his appearance ofhaving recovered himself for one of those intentions of highimpertinence by the aid of which great people les grandsseigneurs persons of her husband s class and type always knowhow to re establish a violated order it was her one purely good fortune that she could feel thus sureimpertinence to her at any rate was not among the arts on whichhe proposed to throw himself for though he had in so almostmystifying a manner replied to nothing denied nothing explained nothing apologised for nothing he had somehowconveyed to her that this was not because of any determination totreat her case as not worth it there had been consideration on both occasions in the way he had listened to her even thoughat the same time there had been extreme reserve a reserveindeed it was also to be remembered qualified by the fact that on their second and shorter interview in portland place andquite at the end of this passage she had imagined him positivelyproposing to her a temporary accommodation it had been but thematter of something in the depths of the eyes he finally fixedupon her and she had found in it the more she kept it beforeher the tacitly offered sketch of a working arrangement leaveme my reserve don t question it it s all i have just now don t you see so that if you ll make me the concession ofletting me alone with it for as long a time as i require ipromise you something or other grown under cover of it eventhough i don t yet quite make out what as a return for yourpatience she had turned away from him with some such unspokenwords as that in her ear and indeed she had to represent toherself that she had spiritually heard them had to listen tothem still again to explain her particular patience in face ofhis particular failure he hadn t so much as pretended to meetfor an instant the question raised by her of her acceptedignorance of the point in time the period before their ownmarriage from which his intimacy with charlotte dated as anignorance in which he and charlotte had been personallyinterested and to the pitch of consummately protecting foryears each other s interest as a condition so imposed upon herthe fact of its having ceased might have made it on the spot the first article of his defence he had vouchsafed it however nothing better than his longest stare of postponed consideration that tribute he had coldly paid it and maggie might herself havebeen stupefied truly had she not had something to hold on by at her own present ability even provisional to make terms witha chapter of history into which she could but a week before nothave dipped without a mortal chill at the rate at which she wasliving she was getting used hour by hour to these extensions ofview and when she asked herself at fawns to what singleobservation of her own in london the prince had had anaffirmation to oppose she but just failed to focus the smallstrained wife of the moments in question as some panting dancerof a difficult step who had capered before the footlights of anempty theatre to a spectator lounging in a box her best comprehension of amerigo s success in not committinghimself was in her recall meanwhile of the inquiries he hadmade of her on their only return to the subject and which he hadin fact explicitly provoked their return in order to make he hadhad it over with her again the so distinctly remarkable incidentof her interview at home with the little bloomsbury shopman thisanecdote for him had not altogether surprisingly requiredsome straighter telling and the prince s attitude in presence ofit had represented once more his nearest approach to across examination the difficulty in respect to the little manhad been for the question of his motive his motive in writing first in the spirit of retraction to a lady with whom he hadmade a most advantageous bargain and in then coming to see herso that his apology should be personal maggie had felt herexplanation weak but there were the facts and she could give noother left alone after the transaction with the knowledge thathis visitor designed the object bought of him as a birthday giftto her father for maggie confessed freely to having chattered tohim almost as to a friend the vendor of the golden bowl hadacted on a scruple rare enough in vendors of any class andalmost unprecedented in the thrifty children of israel he hadn tliked what he had done and what he had above all made such a good thing of having done at the thought of his purchaser sgood faith and charming presence opposed to that flaw in heracquestion which would make it verily as an offering to a lovedparent a thing of sinister meaning and evil effect he had knownconscientious he had known superstitious visitings had givenway to a whim all the more remarkable to his own commercial mind no doubt from its never having troubled him in other connexions she had recognised the oddity of her adventure and left it toshow for what it was she had not been unconscious on the otherhand that if it hadn t touched amerigo so nearly he would havefound in it matter for some amused reflection he had uttered anextraordinary sound something between a laugh and a howl on hersaying as she had made a point of doing oh most certainly hetold me his reason was because he liked me though sheremained in doubt of whether that inarticulate comment had beenprovoked most by the familiarities she had offered or by thosethat so pictured she had had to endure that the partner of herbargain had yearned to see her again that he had plainly jumpedat a pretext for it this also she had frankly expressed herselfto the prince as having in no snubbing no scandalised butrather in a positively appreciative and indebted spirit notdelayed to make out he had wished ever so seriously to returnher a part of her money and she had wholly declined to receiveit and then he had uttered his hope that she had not at allevents already devoted the crystal cup to the beautiful purposeshe had so kindly and so fortunately named to him it wasn t athing for a present to a person she was fond of for she wouldn twish to give a present that would bring ill luck that had cometo him so that he couldn t rest and he should feel better nowthat he had told her his having led her to act in ignorance waswhat he should have been ashamed of and if she would pardon gracious lady as she was all the liberties he had taken shemight make of the bowl any use in life but that one it was after this that the most extraordinary incident of all ofcourse had occurred his pointing to the two photographs withthe remark that those were persons he knew and that morewonderful still he had made acquaintance with them yearsbefore precisely over the same article the lady on thatoccasion had taken up the fancy of presenting it to thegentleman and the gentleman guessing and dodging ever socleverly had declared that he wouldn t for the world receive anobject under such suspicion he himself the little man hadconfessed wouldn t have minded about them but he had neverforgotten either their talk or their faces the impressionaltogether made by them and if she really wished to know now what had perhaps most moved him it was the thought that sheshould ignorantly have gone in for a thing not good enough forother buyers he had been immensely struck that was anotherpoint with this accident of their turning out after so long friends of hers too they had disappeared and this was the onlylight he had ever had upon them he had flushed up quite red with his recognition with all his responsibility had declaredthat the connexion must have had mysteriously something to dowith the impulse he had obeyed and maggie had made to herhusband while he again stood before her no secret of the shock for herself so suddenly and violently received she had done herbest even while taking it full in the face not to give herselfaway but she wouldn t answer no she wouldn t for what shemight in her agitation have made her informant think he mightthink what he would there had been three or four minutes duringwhich while she asked him question upon question she haddoubtless too little cared and he had spoken for hisremembrance as fully as she could have wished he had spoken oh delightedly for the terms on which his other visitors hadappeared to be with each other and in fact for that convictionof the nature and degree of their intimacy under which in spiteof precautions they hadn t been able to help leaving him he hadobserved and judged and not forgotten he had been sure they weregreat people but no ah no distinctly hadn t liked them ashe liked the signora principessa certainly she had created novagueness about that he had been in possession of her name andaddress for sending her both her cup and her account but theothers he had only always wondered about he had been sure theywould never come back and as to the time of their visit hecould place it positively to a day by reason of a transactionof importance recorded in his books that had occurred but a fewhours later he had left her in short definitely rejoicing thathe had been able to make up to her for not having been quite square over their little business by rendering her sounexpectedly the service of this information his joy moreover was as much as amerigo would a matter of the personal interestwith which her kindness gentleness grace her charmingpresence and easy humanity and familiarity had inspired him allof which while in thought maggie went over it again and again oh over any imputable rashness of her own immediate passionand pain as well as over the rest of the straight little storyshe had after all to tell might very conceivably make a longsum for the prince to puzzle out there were meanwhile after the castledeans and those invited tomeet them had gone and before mrs rance and the lutches hadcome three or four days during which she was to learn the fullextent of her need not to be penetrable and then it was indeedthat she felt all the force and threw herself upon all the help of the truth she had confided several nights earlier to fannyassingham she had known it in advance had warned herself of itwhile the house was full charlotte had designs upon her of anature best known to herself and was only waiting for the betteropportunity of their finding themselves less companioned thisconsciousness had been exactly at the bottom of maggie s wish tomultiply their spectators there were moments for her positively moments of planned postponement of evasion scarcelyless disguised than studied during which she turned over withanxiety the different ways there being two or three possibleones in which her young stepmother might at need seek to workupon her amerigo s not having told her of his passage with hiswife gave for maggie altogether a new aspect to charlotte sconsciousness and condition an aspect with which forapprehension for wonder and even at moments inconsequentlyenough for something like compassion the princess had now toreckon she asked herself for she was capable of that what hehad meant by keeping the sharer of his guilt in the dark about amatter touching her otherwise so nearly what he had meant thatis for this unmistakably mystified personage herself maggiecould imagine what he had meant for her all sorts of thinkablethings whether things of mere form or things of sincerity things of pity or things of prudence he had meant for instance in all probability primarily to conjure away any suchappearance of a changed relation between the two women as hisfather in law might notice and follow up it would have been opento him however given the pitch of their intimacy to avert thisdanger by some more conceivable course with charlotte since anearnest warning in fact the full freedom of alarm that of hisinsisting to her on the peril of suspicion incurred and on theimportance accordingly of outward peace at any price would havebeen the course really most conceivable instead of warning andadvising he had reassured and deceived her so that our youngwoman who had been from far back by the habit if her nature as much on her guard against sacrificing others as if she feltthe great trap of life mainly to be set for one s doing so nowfound herself attaching her fancy to that side of the situationof the exposed pair which involved for themselves at least thesacrifice of the least fortunate she never at present thought of what amerigo might beintending without the reflection by the same stroke that whatever this quantity he was leaving still more to her owningenuity he was helping her when the thing came to the test only by the polished possibly almost too polished surface hismanner to his wife wore for an admiring world and that surely was entitled to scarcely more than the praise of negativediplomacy he was keeping his manner right as she had related tomrs assingham the case would have been beyond calculation truly if on top of everything he had allowed it to go wrong she had hours of exaltation indeed when the meaning of all thispressed in upon her as a tacit vow from him to abide withoutquestion by whatever she should be able to achieve or think fitto prescribe then it was that even while holding her breath forthe awe of it she truly felt almost able enough for anything itwas as if she had passed in a time incredibly short from beingnothing for him to being all it was as if rightly noted everyturn of his head every tone of his voice in these days mightmean that there was but one way in which a proud man reduced toabjection could hold himself during those of maggie s vigils inwhich that view loomed largest the image of her husband that itthus presented to her gave out a beauty for the revelation ofwhich she struck herself as paying if anything all too little to make sure of it to make sure of the beauty shining out of thehumility and of the humility lurking in all the pride of hispresence she would have gone the length of paying more yet ofpaying with difficulties and anxieties compared to which thoseactually before her might have been as superficial as headachesor rainy days the point at which these exaltations dropped however was thepoint at which it was apt to come over her that if hercomplications had been greater the question of paying would havebeen limited still less to the liabilities of her own pocket thecomplications were verily great enough whether for ingenuitiesor sublimities so long as she had to come back to it so oftenthat charlotte all the while could only be struggling withsecrets sharper than her own it was odd how that certainty againand again determined and coloured her wonderments of detail thequestion for instance of how amerigo in snatched opportunitiesof conference put the haunted creature off with falseexplanations met her particular challenges and evaded if thatwas what he did do her particular demands even the convictionthat charlotte was but awaiting some chance really to test hertrouble upon her lover s wife left maggie s sense meanwhile openas to the sight of gilt wires and bruised wings the spacious butsuspended cage the home of eternal unrest of pacings beatings shakings all so vain into which the baffled consciousnesshelplessly resolved itself the cage was the deluded condition and maggie as having known delusion rather understood thenature of cages she walked round charlotte s cautiously and ina very wide circle and when inevitably they had to communicateshe felt herself comparatively outside on the breast ofnature and saw her companion s face as that of a prisonerlooking through bars so it was that through bars bars richlygilt but firmly though discreetly planted charlotte finallystruck her as making a grim attempt from which at first theprincess drew back as instinctively as if the door of the cagehad suddenly been opened from within xxxvithey had been alone that evening alone as a party of six andfour of them after dinner under suggestion not to be resisted sat down to bridge in the smoking room they had passedtogether to that apartment on rising from table charlotte andmrs assingham alike indulgent always to tobacco and in factpractising an emulation which as fanny said would for herself had the colonel not issued an interdict based on the fear of herstealing his cigars have stopped only at the short pipe herecards had with inevitable promptness asserted their rule thegame forming itself as had often happened before of mr ververwith mrs assingham for partner and of the prince with mrs verver the colonel who had then asked of maggie license torelieve his mind of a couple of letters for the earliest post outon the morrow was addressing himself to this task at the otherend of the room and the princess herself had welcomed thecomparatively hushed hour for the bridge players were seriousand silent much in the mood of a tired actress who has the goodfortune to be off while her mates are on almost long enoughfor a nap on the property sofa in the wing maggie s nap had shebeen able to snatch forty winks would have been of the spiritrather than of the sense yet as she subsided near a lamp withthe last salmon coloured french periodical she was to fail forrefreshment even of that sip of independence there was no question for her as she found of closing her eyesand getting away they strayed back to life in the stillness over the top of her review she could lend herself to none ofthose refinements of the higher criticism with which its pagesbristled she was there where her companions were there againand more than ever there it was as if of a sudden they hadbeen made in their personal intensity and their rare complexityof relation freshly importunate to her it was the first eveningthere had been no one else mrs rance and the lutches were duethe next day but meanwhile the facts of the situation wereupright for her round the green cloth and the silver flambeaux the fact of her father s wife s lover facing his mistress thefact of her father sitting all unsounded and unblinking betweenthem the fact of charlotte keeping it up keeping up everything across the table with her husband beside her the fact of fannyassingham wonderful creature placed opposite to the three andknowing more about each probably when one came to think thaneither of them knew of either erect above all for her was thesharp edged fact of the relation of the whole group individuallyand collectively to herself herself so speciously eliminatedfor the hour but presumably more present to the attention ofeach than the next card to be played yes under that imputation to her sense they sat theimputation of wondering beneath and behind all their apparentlystraight play if she weren t really watching them from hercorner and consciously as might be said holding them in herhand she was asking herself at last how they could bear it for though cards were as nought to her and she could follow no move so that she was always on such occasions out of the party theystruck her as conforming alike in the matter of gravity andpropriety to the stiff standard of the house her father sheknew was a high adept one of the greatest she had been ever in her stupidity his small his sole despair amerigo excelledeasily as he understood and practised every art that couldbeguile large leisure mrs assingham and charlotte moreover were accounted as good as members of a sex incapable of thenobler consistency could be therefore evidently they were not all so up to their usual form merely passing it off whether forher or for themselves and the amount of enjoyed or at leastachieved security represented by so complete a conquest ofappearances was what acted on her nerves precisely with a kindof provocative force she found herself for five minutes thrilling with the idea of the prodigious effect that just asshe sat there near them she had at her command with the sensethat if she were but different oh ever so different all thishigh decorum would hang by a hair there reigned for her absolutely during these vertiginous moments that fascination ofthe monstrous that temptation of the horribly possible which weso often trace by its breaking out suddenly lest it should gofurther in unexplained retreats and reactions after it had been thus vividly before her for a little that springing up under her wrong and making them all start stare andturn pale she might sound out their doom in a single sentence asentence easy to choose among several of the lurid after she hadfaced that blinding light and felt it turn to blackness she rosefrom her place laying aside her magazine and moved slowly roundthe room passing near the card players and pausing an instantbehind the chairs in turn silent and discreet she bent a vaguemild face upon them as if to signify that little as shefollowed their doings she wished them well and she took fromeach across the table in the common solemnity an upwardrecognition which she was to carry away with her on her movingout to the terrace a few minutes later her father and herhusband mrs assingham and charlotte had done nothing but meether eyes yet the difference in these demonstrations made each aseparate passage which was all the more wonderful since withthe secret behind every face they had alike tried to look at herthrough it and in denial of it it all left her as she wandered off with the strangest ofimpressions the sense forced upon her as never yet of anappeal a positive confidence from the four pairs of eyes thatwas deeper than any negation and that seemed to speak on thepart of each of some relation to be contrived by her a relationwith herself which would spare the individual the danger theactual present strain of the relation with the others theythus tacitly put it upon her to be disposed of the wholecomplexity of their peril and she promptly saw why because shewas there and there just as she was to lift it off them andtake it to charge herself with it as the scapegoat of old ofwhom she had once seen a terrible picture had been charged withthe sins of the people and had gone forth into the desert to sinkunder his burden and die that indeed wasn t their design andtheir interest that she should sink under hers it wouldn t betheir feeling that she should do anything but live live onsomehow for their benefit and even as much as possible in theircompany to keep proving to them that they had truly escaped andthat she was still there to simplify this idea of hersimplifying and of their combined struggle dim as yet butsteadily growing toward the perception of her adopting it fromthem clung to her while she hovered on the terrace where thesummer night was so soft that she scarce needed the light shawlshe had picked up several of the long windows of the occupiedrooms stood open to it and the light came out in vague shaftsand fell upon the old smooth stones the hour was moonless andstarless and the air heavy and still which was why in herevening dress she need fear no chill and could get away in theouter darkness from that provocation of opportunity which hadassaulted her within on her sofa as a beast might have leapedat her throat nothing in fact was stranger than the way in which when she hadremained there a little her companions watched by her throughone of the windows actually struck her as almost consciously andgratefully safer they might have been really charming as theyshowed in the beautiful room and charlotte certainly as always magnificently handsome and supremely distinguished they mighthave been figures rehearsing some play of which she herself wasthe author they might even for the happy appearance theycontinued to present have been such figures as would by thestrong note of character in each fill any author with thecertitude of success especially of their own histrionic theymight in short have represented any mystery they would the pointbeing predominantly that the key to the mystery the key thatcould wind and unwind it without a snap of the spring was therein her pocket or rather no doubt clasped at this crisis in herhand and pressed as she walked back and forth to her breast she walked to the end and far out of the light she returned andsaw the others still where she had left them she passed roundthe house and looked into the drawing room lighted also butempty now and seeming to speak the more in its own voice ofall the possibilities she controlled spacious and splendid likea stage again awaiting a drama it was a scene she might people by the press of her spring either with serenities and dignitiesand decencies or with terrors and shames and ruins things asugly as those formless fragments of her golden bowl she wastrying so hard to pick up she continued to walk and continued to pause she stopped afreshfor the look into the smoking room and by this time it was asif the recognition had of itself arrested her she saw as in apicture with the temptation she had fled from quite extinct whyit was she had been able to give herself so little from thefirst to the vulgar heat of her wrong she might fairly as shewatched them have missed it as a lost thing have yearned forit for the straight vindictive view the rights of resentment the rages of jealousy the protests of passion as for somethingshe had been cheated of not least a range of feelings which formany women would have meant so much but which for her husband swife for her father s daughter figured nothing nearer toexperience than a wild eastern caravan looming into view withcrude colours in the sun fierce pipes in the air high spearsagainst the sky all a thrill a natural joy to mingle with butturning off short before it reached her and plunging into otherdefiles she saw at all events why horror itself had almostfailed her the horror that foreshadowed in advance would byher thought have made everything that was unaccustomed in hercry out with pain the horror of finding evil seated all at itsease where she had only dreamed of good the horror of the thinghideously behind behind so much trusted so much pretended nobleness cleverness tenderness it was the first sharp falsityshe had known in her life to touch at all or be touched by ithad met her like some bad faced stranger surprised in one of thethick carpeted corridors of a house of quiet on a sundayafternoon and yet yes amazingly she had been able to look atterror and disgust only to know that she must put away from herthe bitter sweet of their freshness the sight from the window of the group so constituted told her why told her how named toher as with hard lips named straight at her so that she musttake it full in the face that other possible relation to thewhole fact which alone would bear upon her irresistibly it wasextraordinary they positively brought home to her that to feelabout them in any of the immediate inevitable assuaging ways the ways usually open to innocence outraged and generositybetrayed would have been to give them up and that giving themup was marvellously not to be thought of she had never fromthe first hour of her state of acquired conviction given them upso little as now though she was no doubt as the consequence ofa step taken a few minutes later to invoke the conception ofdoing that if might be even less she had resumed her walk stopping here and there while she rested on the cool smoothstone balustrade to draw it out in the course of which after alittle she passed again the lights of the empty drawing room andpaused again for what she saw and felt there it was not at once however that this became quite concrete that was the effect of her presently making out that charlottewas in the room launched and erect there in the middle andlooking about her that she had evidently just come round to it from her card table by one of the passages with theexpectation to all appearance of joining her stepdaughter shehad pulled up at seeing the great room empty maggie not havingpassed out on leaving the group in a manner to be observed sodefinite a quest of her with the bridge party interrupted oraltered for it was an impression that fairly assailed theprincess and to which something of attitude and aspect of theair of arrested pursuit and purpose in charlotte together withthe suggestion of her next vague movements quickly added itsmeaning this meaning was that she had decided that she had beeninfinitely conscious of maggie s presence before that she knewthat she would at last find her alone and that she wanted her for some reason enough to have presumably called on bobassingham for aid he had taken her chair and let her go and thearrangement was for maggie a signal proof of her earnestness ofthe energy in fact that though superficially commonplace in asituation in which people weren t supposed to be watching eachother was what affected our young woman on the spot as abreaking of bars the splendid shining supple creature was out ofthe cage was at large and the question now almost grotesquelyrose of whether she mightn t by some art just where she was andbefore she could go further be hemmed in and secured it wouldhave been for a moment in this case a matter of quickly closingthe windows and giving the alarm with poor maggie s sense that though she couldn t know what she wanted of her it was enoughfor trepidation that at these firm hands anything should be tosay nothing of the sequel of a flight taken again along theterrace even under the shame of the confessed feebleness of suchevasions on the part of an outraged wife it was to thisfeebleness none the less that the outraged wife had presentlyresorted the most that could be said for her being as she feltwhile she finally stopped short at a distance that she could atany rate resist her abjection sufficiently not to sneak into thehouse by another way and safely reach her room she had literallycaught herself in the act of dodging and ducking and it told herthere vividly in a single word what she had all along beenmost afraid of she had been afraid of the particular passage with charlotte thatwould determine her father s wife to take him into her confidenceas she couldn t possibly as yet have done to prepare for him astatement of her wrong to lay before him the infamy of what shewas apparently suspected of this should she have made up hermind to do it would rest on a calculation the thought of whichevoked strangely other possibilities and visions it would showher as sufficiently believing in her grasp of her husband to beable to assure herself that with his daughter thrown on thedefensive with maggie s cause and maggie s word in fine against her own it wasn t maggie s that would most certainlycarry the day such a glimpse of her conceivable idea whichwould be founded on reasons all her own reasons of experienceand assurance impenetrable to others but intimately familiar toherself such a glimpse opened out wide as soon as it had comeinto view for if so much as this was still firm ground betweenthe elder pair if the beauty of appearances had been soconsistently preserved it was only the golden bowl as maggieherself knew it that had been broken the breakage stood not forany wrought discomposure among the triumphant three it stoodmerely for the dire deformity of her attitude toward them shewas unable at the minute of course fully to measure thedifference thus involved for her and it remained inevitably anagitating image the way it might be held over her that if shedidn t of her own prudence satisfy charlotte as to thereference in her mocking spirit of so much of the unuttered andunutterable of the constantly and unmistakably implied herfather would be invited without further ceremony to recommend herto do so but any confidence any latent operating insolence that mrs verver should thanks to her large native resources continue to be possessed of and to hold in reserve glimmeredsuddenly as a possible working light and seemed to offer formeeting her a new basis and something like a new system maggie felt truly a rare contraction of the heart on makingout the next instant what the new system would probably have tobe and she had practically done that before perceiving that thething she feared had already taken place charlotte extendingher search appeared now to define herself vaguely in thedistance of this after an instant the princess was sure though the darkness was thick for the projected clearness of thesmoking room windows had presently contributed its help herfriend came slowly into that circle having also for herself bythis time not indistinguishably discovered that maggie was onthe terrace maggie from the end saw her stop before one of thewindows to look at the group within and then saw her come nearerand pause again still with a considerable length of the placebetween them yes charlotte had seen she was watching her from afar and hadstopped now to put her further attention to the test her facewas fixed on her through the night she was the creature who hadescaped by force from her cage yet there was in her whole motionassuredly even as so dimly discerned a kind of portentousintelligent stillness she had escaped with an intention butwith an intention the more definite that it could so accord withquiet measures the two women at all events only hovered there for these first minutes face to face over their interval andexchanging no sign the intensity of their mutual look might havepierced the night and maggie was at last to start with thescared sense of having thus yielded to doubt to dread tohesitation for a time that with no other proof needed wouldhave completely given her away how long had she stood staring a single minute or five long enough in any case to have feltherself absolutely take from her visitor something that thelatter threw upon her irresistibly by this effect of silence by this effect of waiting and watching by this effect unmistakably of timing her indecision and her fear if then scared and hanging back she had as was so evident sacrificedall past pretences it would have been with the instant knowledgeof an immense advantage gained that charlotte finally saw hercome on maggie came on with her heart in her hands she came onwith the definite prevision throbbing like the tick of a watch of a doom impossibly sharp and hard but to which after lookingat it with her eyes wide open she had none the less bowed herhead by the time she was at her companion s side for thatmatter by the time charlotte had without a motion without aword simply let her approach and stand there her head wasalready on the block so that the consciousness that everythinghad now gone blurred all perception of whether or no the axe hadfallen oh the advantage it was perfectly enough in truth with mrs verver for what was maggie s own sense but that ofhaving been thrown over on her back with her neck from thefirst half broken and her helpless face staring up thatposition only could account for the positive grimace of weaknessand pain produced there by charlotte s dignity i ve come to join you i thought you would be here oh yes i m here maggie heard herself return a little flatly it s too close in doors very but close even here charlotte was still and grave shehad even uttered her remark about the temperature with anexpressive weight that verged upon solemnity so that maggie reduced to looking vaguely about at the sky could only feel hernot fail of her purpose the air s heavy as if with thunder ithink there ll be a storm she made the suggestion to carry offan awkwardness which was a part always of her companion sgain but the awkwardness didn t diminish in the silence thatfollowed charlotte had said nothing in reply her brow was darkas with a fixed expression and her high elegance her handsomehead and long straight neck testified through the dusk totheir inveterate completeness and noble erectness it was as ifwhat she had come out to do had already begun and when as aconsequence maggie had said helplessly don t you wantsomething won t you have my shawl everything might havecrumbled away in the comparative poverty of the tribute mrs verver s rejection of it had the brevity of a sign that theyhadn t closed in for idle words just as her dim serious face uninterruptedly presented until they moved again might haverepresented the success with which she watched all her messagepenetrate they presently went back the way she had come but shestopped maggie again within range of the smoking room window andmade her stand where the party at cards would be before her sideby side for three minutes they fixed this picture of quietharmonies the positive charm of it and as might have been said the full significance which as was now brought home to maggie could be no more after all than a matter of interpretation differing always for a different interpreter as she herself hadhovered in sight of it a quarter of an hour before it would havebeen a thing for her to show charlotte to show in righteousirony in reproach too stern for anything but silence but now itwas she who was being shown it and shown it by charlotte andshe saw quickly enough that as charlotte showed it so she mustat present submissively seem to take it the others were absorbed and unconscious either silent overtheir game or dropping remarks unheard on the terrace and it wasto her father s quiet face discernibly expressive of nothingthat was in his daughter s mind that our young woman s attentionwas most directly given his wife and his daughter were bothclosely watching him and to which of them could he have beennotified of this would his raised eyes first all impulsively have responded in which of them would he have felt it mostimportant to destroy for his clutch at the equilibrium any germof uneasiness not yet since his marriage had maggie so sharplyand so formidably known her old possession of him as a thingdivided and contested she was looking at him by charlotte sleave and under charlotte s direction quite in fact as if theparticular way she should look at him were prescribed to her quite even as if she had been defied to look at him in anyother it came home to her too that the challenge wasn t asmight be said in his interest and for his protection but pressingly insistently in charlotte s for that of her securityat any price she might verily by this dumb demonstration havebeen naming to maggie the price naming it as a question formaggie herself a sum of money that she properly was to find she must remain safe and maggie must pay what she was to paywith being her own affair straighter than ever thus the princess again felt it all putupon her and there was a minute just a supreme instant duringwhich there burned in her a wild wish that her father would onlylook up it throbbed for these seconds as a yearning appeal tohim she would chance it that is if he would but just raise hiseyes and catch them across the larger space standing in theouter dark together then he might be affected by the sight taking them as they were he might make some sign she scarceknew what that would save her save her from being the one thisway to pay all he might somehow show a preference distinguishing between them might out of pity for her signalto her that this extremity of her effort for him was more than heasked that represented maggie s one little lapse fromconsistency the sole small deflection in the whole course of herscheme it had come to nothing the next minute for the dearman s eyes had never moved and charlotte s hand promptly passedinto her arm had already had very firmly drawn her on quite for that matter as from some sudden some equal perception onher part too of the more ways than one in which their impressioncould appeal they retraced their steps along the rest of theterrace turning the corner of the house and presently cameabreast of the other windows those of the pompous drawing room still lighted and still empty here charlotte again paused andit was again as if she were pointing out what maggie had observedfor herself the very look the place had of being vivid in itsstillness of having with all its great objects as ordered andbalanced as for a formal reception been appointed for some hightransaction some real affair of state in presence of thisopportunity she faced her companion once more she traced in herthe effect of everything she had already communicated shesignified with the same success that the terrace and the sullennight would bear too meagre witness to the completion of heridea soon enough then within the room under the old lustres ofvenice and the eyes of the several great portraits more or lesscontemporary with these that awaited on the walls of fawns theirfinal far migration soon enough maggie found herself staring and at first all too gaspingly at the grand total to which eachseparate demand mrs verver had hitherto made upon her howevershe had made it now amounted i ve been wanting and longer than you d perhaps believe to puta question to you for which no opportunity has seemed to me yetquite so good as this it would have been easier perhaps if youhad struck me as in the least disposed ever to give me one ihave to take it now you see as i find it they stood in thecentre of the immense room and maggie could feel that the sceneof life her imagination had made of it twenty minutes before wasby this time sufficiently peopled these few straight wordsfilled it to its uttermost reaches and nothing was now absentfrom her consciousness either of the part she was called uponto play in it charlotte had marched straight in dragging herrich train she rose there beautiful and free with her wholeaspect and action attuned to the firmness of her speech maggiehad kept the shawl she had taken out with her and clutching ittight in her nervousness drew it round her as if huddling in itfor shelter covering herself with it for humility she lookedout as from under an improvised hood the sole headgear of somepoor woman at somebody s proud door she waited even like thepoor woman she met her friend s eyes with recognitions shecouldn t suppress she might sound it as she could whatquestion then everything in her from head to foot crowded itupon charlotte that she knew she knew too well that she wasshowing so that successful vagueness to save some scrap of herdignity from the imminence of her defeat was already a lostcause and the one thing left was if possible at any cost eventhat of stupid inconsequence to try to look as if she weren tafraid if she could but appear at all not afraid she mightappear a little not ashamed that is not ashamed to be afraid which was the kind of shame that could be fastened on her itbeing fear all the while that moved her her challenge at anyrate her wonder her terror the blank blurred surface whatever it was that she presented became a mixture that ceasedto signify for to the accumulated advantage by which charlottewas at present sustained her next words themselves had little toadd have you any ground of complaint of me is there any wrong youconsider i ve done you i feel at last that i ve a right to askyou their eyes had to meet on it and to meet long maggie s avoidedat least the disgrace of looking away what makes you want toask it my natural desire to know you ve done that for so long littlejustice maggie waited a moment for so long you mean you vethought i mean my dear that i ve seen i ve seen week after week that you seemed to be thinking of something that perplexed orworried you is it anything for which i m in any degreeresponsible maggie summoned all her powers what in the world should it be ah that s not for me to imagine and i should be very sorry tohave to try to say i m aware of no point whatever at which i mayhave failed you said charlotte nor of any at which i may havefailed any one in whom i can suppose you sufficiently interestedto care if i ve been guilty of some fault i ve committed it allunconsciously and am only anxious to hear from you honestlyabout it but if i ve been mistaken as to what i speak of thedifference more and more marked as i ve thought in all yourmanner to me why obviously so much the better no form ofcorrection received from you could give me greater satisfaction she spoke it struck her companion with rising withextraordinary ease as if hearing herself say it all besidesseeing the way it was listened to helped her from point topoint she saw she was right that this was the tone for her totake and the thing for her to do the thing as to which she wasprobably feeling that she had in advance in her delays anduncertainties much exaggerated the difficulty the difficultywas small and it grew smaller as her adversary continued toshrink she was not only doing as she wanted but had by thistime effectively done it and hung it up all of which butdeepened maggie s sense of the sharp and simple need now ofseeing her through to the end if you ve been mistaken yousay and the princess but barely faltered you have beenmistaken charlotte looked at her splendidly hard you re perfectly sureit s all my mistake all i can say is that you ve received a false impression ah then so much the better from the moment i had received it iknew i must sooner or later speak of it for that you see is systematically my way and now charlotte added you make meglad i ve spoken i thank you very much it was strange how for maggie too with this the difficultyseemed to sink her companion s acceptance of her denial was likea general pledge not to keep things any worse for her than theyessentially had to be it positively helped her to build up herfalsehood to which accordingly she contributed another block i ve affected you evidently quite accidentally in some way ofwhich i ve been all unaware i ve not felt at any time thatyou ve wronged me how could i come within a mile charlotte inquired of such apossibility maggie with her eyes on her more easily now made no attempt tosay she said after a little something more to the presentpoint i accuse you i accuse you of nothing ah that s lucky charlotte had brought this out with the richness almost ofgaiety and maggie to go on had to think with her ownintensity of amerigo to think how he on his side had had togo through with his lie to her how it was for his wife he haddone so and how his doing so had given her the clue and set herthe example he must have had his own difficulty about it andshe was not after all falling below him it was in fact as if thanks to her hovering image of him confronted with thisadmirable creature even as she was confronted there glowed uponher from afar yet straight and strong a deep explanatory lightwhich covered the last inch of the ground he had given hersomething to conform to and she hadn t unintelligently turned onhim gone back on him as he would have said by notconforming they were together thus he and she close closetogether whereas charlotte though rising there radiantly beforeher was really off in some darkness of space that would steepher in solitude and harass her with care the heart of theprincess swelled accordingly even in her abasement she hadkept in tune with the right and something certainly somethingthat might be like a rare flower snatched from an impossibleledge would and possibly soon come of it for her the right the right yes it took this extraordinary form of herhumbugging as she had called it to the end it was only aquestion of not by a hair s breadth deflecting into the truth so supremely was she braced you must take it from me thatyour anxiety rests quite on a misconception you must take itfrom me that i ve never at any moment fancied i could suffer byyou and marvellously she kept it up not only kept it up butimproved on it you must take it from me that i ve never thoughtof you but as beautiful wonderful and good which is all ithink that you can possibly ask charlotte held her a moment longer she needed not then to haveappeared only tactless the last word it s much more my dear than i dreamed of asking i only wanted your denial well then you have it upon your honour upon my honour and she made a point even our young woman of not turning away her grip of her shawl had loosened she had let it fall behindher but she stood there for anything more and till the weightshould be lifted with which she saw soon enough what more was tocome she saw it in charlotte s face and felt it make betweenthem in the air a chill that completed the coldness of theirconscious perjury will you kiss me on it then she couldn t say yes but she didn t say no what availed herstill however was to measure in her passivity how much toofar charlotte had come to retreat but there was somethingdifferent also something for which while her cheek received theprodigious kiss she had her opportunity the sight of theothers who having risen from their cards to join the absentmembers of their party had reached the open door at the end ofthe room and stopped short evidently in presence of thedemonstration that awaited them her husband and her father werein front and charlotte s embrace of her which wasn t to bedistinguished for them either she felt from her embrace ofcharlotte took on with their arrival a high publicity xxxviiher father had asked her three days later in an interval ofcalm how she was affected in the light of their reappearanceand of their now perhaps richer fruition by dotty and kitty andby the once formidable mrs rance and the consequence of thisinquiry had been for the pair just such another strolltogether away from the rest of the party and off into the park as had asserted its need to them on the occasion of the previousvisit of these anciently more agitating friends that of theirlong talk on a sequestered bench beneath one of the great trees when the particular question had come up for them the thenpurblind discussion of which at their enjoyed leisure maggiehad formed the habit of regarding as the first beginning oftheir present situation the whirligig of time had thus broughtround for them again on their finding themselves face to facewhile the others were gathering for tea on the terrace the sameodd impulse quietly to slope so adam verver himself as theywent familiarly expressed it that had acted in its way ofold acted for the distant autumn afternoon and for the sharpnessof their since so outlived crisis it might have been funny tothem now that the presence of mrs rance and the lutches andwith symptoms too at that time less developed had once fortheir anxiety and their prudence constituted a crisis it mighthave been funny that these ladies could ever have figured totheir imagination as a symbol of dangers vivid enough toprecipitate the need of a remedy this amount of entertainmentand assistance they were indeed disposed to extract from theiractual impressions they had been finding it for months past bymaggie s view a resource and a relief to talk with an approachto intensity when they met of all the people they weren treally thinking of and didn t really care about the people withwhom their existence had begun almost to swarm and they closedin at present round the spectres of their past as they permittedthemselves to describe the three ladies with a better imitationof enjoying their theme than they had been able to achieve certainly during the stay for instance of the castledeans thecastledeans were a new joke comparatively and they had had always to maggie s view to teach themselves the way of it whereas the detroit the providence party rebounding so fromprovidence from detroit was an old and ample one of which themost could be made and as to which a humorous insistence could beguarded sharp and sudden moreover this afternoon had been theirwell nigh confessed desire just to rest together a little asfrom some strain long felt but never named to rest as whoshould say shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand each pair ofeyes so yearningly and indeed what could it be but so wearily closed as to render the collapse safe from detection by the otherpair it was positively as if in short the inward felicity oftheir being once more perhaps only for half an hour simplydaughter and father had glimmered out for them and they hadpicked up the pretext that would make it easiest they werehusband and wife oh so immensely as regards other persons but after they had dropped again on their old bench consciousthat the party on the terrace augmented as in the past byneighbours would do beautifully without them it was wonderfullylike their having got together into some boat and paddled offfrom the shore where husbands and wives luxuriant complications made the air too tropical in the boat they were father anddaughter and poor dotty and kitty supplied abundantly for theirsituation the oars or the sail why into the bargain for thatmatter this came to maggie couldn t they always live so far asthey lived together in a boat she felt in her face with thequestion the breath of a possibility that soothed her theyneeded only know each other henceforth in the unmarriedrelation that other sweet evening in the same place he hadbeen as unmarried as possible which had kept down so to speak the quantity of change in their state well then that othersweet evening was what the present sweet evening would resemble with the quite calculable effect of an exquisite inwardrefreshment they had after all whatever happened always andever each other each other that was the hidden treasure and thesaving truth to do exactly what they would with a provisionfull of possibilities who could tell as yet what thanks toit they wouldn t have done before the end they had meanwhile been tracing together in the golden air that toward six o clock of a july afternoon hung about the massedkentish woods several features of the social evolution of herold playmates still beckoned on it would seem by unattainableideals still falling back beyond the sea to their nativeseats for renewals of the moral financial conversational onescarce knew what to call it outfit and again and for everreappearing like a tribe of wandering jewesses our couple hadfinally exhausted however the study of these annals and maggiewas to take up after a drop a different matter or one at leastwith which the immediate connection was not at first apparent were you amused at me just now when i wondered what otherpeople could wish to struggle for did you think me she askedwith some earnestness well fatuous fatuous he seemed at a loss i mean sublime in our happiness as if looking down from aheight or rather sublime in our general position that s whati mean she spoke as from the habit of her anxious consciencesomething that disposed her frequently to assure herself for herhuman commerce of the state of the books of the spirit because i don t at all want she explained to be blinded ormade sniffy by any sense of a social situation her fatherlistened to this declaration as if the precautions of her generalmercy could still as they betrayed themselves have surprisesfor him to say nothing of a charm of delicacy and beauty hemight have been wishing to see how far she could go and where shewould all touchingly to him arrive but she waited a little asif made nervous precisely by feeling him depend too much onwhat she said they were avoiding the serious standing off anxiously from the real and they fell again and again as ifto disguise their precaution itself into the tone of the timethat came back to them from their other talk when they hadshared together this same refuge don t you remember she wenton how when they were here before i broke it to you that iwasn t so very sure we ourselves had the thing itself he did his best to do so had you mean a social situation yes after fanny assingham had first broken it to me that atthe rate we were going we should never have one which was what put us on charlotte oh yes they had had itover quite often enough for him easily to remember maggie had another pause taking it from him that he now couldboth affirm and admit without wincing that they had been attheir critical moment put on charlotte it was as if thisrecognition had been threshed out between them as fundamental tothe honest view of their success well she continued irecall how i felt about kitty and dotty that even if we hadalready then been more placed or whatever you may call what weare now it still wouldn t have been an excuse for wondering whyothers couldn t obligingly leave me more exalted by having themselves smaller ideas for those she said were thefeelings we used to have oh yes he responded philosophically i remember the feelingswe used to have maggie appeared to wish to plead for them a little in tenderretrospect as if they had been also respectable it was badenough i thought to have no sympathy in your heart when you hada position but it was worse to be sublime about it as i was soafraid as i m in fact still afraid of being when it wasn t eventhere to support one and she put forth again the earnestnessshe might have been taking herself as having outlived became forit which was doubtless too often even now her danger almostsententious one must always whether or no have someimagination of the states of others of what they may feeldeprived of however she added kitty and dotty couldn timagine we were deprived of anything and now and now butshe stopped as for indulgence to their wonder and envy and now they see still more that we can have got everything and kept everything and yet not be proud no we re not proud she answered after a moment i m not surethat we re quite proud enough yet she changed the next instantthat subject too she could only do so however by harkingback as if it had been a fascination she might have beenwishing under this renewed this still more suggestivevisitation to keep him with her for remounting the stream oftime and dipping again for the softness of the water into thecontracted basin of the past we talked about it we talkedabout it you don t remember so well as i you too didn t know and it was beautiful of you like kitty and dotty you too thoughtwe had a position and were surprised when i thought we oughtto have told them we weren t doing for them what they supposed in fact maggie pursued we re not doing it now we re not yousee really introducing them i mean not to the people theywant then what do you call the people with whom they re now havingtea it made her quite spring round that s just what you asked methe other time one of the days there was somebody and i toldyou i didn t call anybody anything i remember that such people the people we made so welcome didn t count that fanny assingham knew they didn t she hadawakened his daughter the echo and on the bench there asbefore he nodded his head amusedly he kept nervously shakinghis foot yes they were only good enough the people who came for us i remember he said again that was the way it allhappened that was the way that was the way and you asked me maggieadded if i didn t think we ought to tell them tell mrs rance in particular i mean that we had been entertaining her up tothen under false pretences precisely but you said she wouldn t have understood to which you replied that in that case you were like her youdidn t understand no no but i remember how about our having in our benightedinnocence no position you quite crushed me with yourexplanation well then said maggie with every appearance of delight i llcrush you again i told you that you by yourself had one therewas no doubt of that you were different from me you had thesame one you always had and then i asked you her father concurred why in that caseyou hadn t the same then indeed you did he had brought her face round to himbefore and this held it covering him with its kindledbrightness the result of the attested truth of their being ablethus in talk to live again together what i replied was that ihad lost my position by my marriage that one i know how isaw it would never come back i had done something to it ididn t quite know what given it away somehow and yet not asthen appeared really got my return i had been assured alwaysby dear fanny that i could get it only i must wake up so i wastrying you see to wake up trying very hard yes and to a certain extent you succeeded as also in wakingme but you made much he said of your difficulty to whichhe added it s the only case i remember mag of you ever makinganything of a difficulty she kept her eyes on him a moment that i was so happy as iwas that you were so happy as you were well you admitted maggie kept it up that that was a gooddifficulty you confessed that our life did seem to bebeautiful he thought a moment yes i may very well have confessed it forso it did seem to me but he guarded himself with his dim hiseasier smile what do you want to put on me now only that we used to wonder that we were wondering then if ourlife wasn t perhaps a little selfish this also for a time muchat his leisure adam verver retrospectively fixed because fannyassingham thought so oh no she never thought she couldn t think if she would anything of that sort she only thinks people are sometimesfools maggie developed she doesn t seem to think so muchabout their being wrong wrong that is in the sense of beingwicked she doesn t the princess further adventured quite somuch mind their being wicked i see i see and yet it might have been for his daughter thathe didn t so very vividly see then she only thought us fools oh no i don t say that i m speaking of our being selfish and that comes under the head of the wickedness fanny condones oh i don t say she condones a scruple in maggie raised itscrest besides i m speaking of what was her father showed however after a little that he had not beenreached by this discrimination his thoughts were resting for themoment where they had settled look here mag he saidreflectively i ain t selfish i ll be blowed if i m selfish well maggie if he would talk of that could also pronounce then father i am oh shucks said adam verver to whom the vernacular in momentsof deepest sincerity could thus come back i ll believe it hepresently added when amerigo complains of you ah it s just he who s my selfishness i m selfish so to speak for him i mean she continued that he s my motive ineverything well her father could from experience fancy what she meant but hasn t a girl a right to be selfish about her husband what i don t mean she observed without answering is that i mjealous of him but that s his merit it s not mine her father again seemed amused at her you could be otherwise oh how can i talk she asked of otherwise it isn t luckilyfor me otherwise if everything were different she furtherpresented her thought of course everything would be and thenagain as if that were but half my idea is this that when youonly love a little you re naturally not jealous or are onlyjealous also a little so that it doesn t matter but when youlove in a deeper and intenser way then you are in the sameproportion jealous your jealousy has intensity and no doubt ferocity when however you love in the most abysmal andunutterable way of all why then you re beyond everything andnothing can pull you down mr verver listened as if he had nothing on these high lines tooppose and that s the way you love for a minute she failed to speak but at last she answered itwasn t to talk about that i do feel however beyond everything and as a consequence of that i dare say she added with aturn to gaiety seem often not to know quite where i am the mere fine pulse of passion in it the suggestion as of acreature consciously floating and shining in a warm summer sea some element of dazzling sapphire and silver a creature cradledupon depths buoyant among dangers in which fear or folly orsinking otherwise than in play was impossible something of allthis might have been making once more present to him with hisdiscreet his half shy assent to it her probable enjoyment of arapture that he in his day had presumably convinced no greatnumber of persons either of his giving or of his receiving hesat awhile as if he knew himself hushed almost admonished andnot for the first time yet it was an effect that might havebrought before him rather what she had gained than what he hadmissed besides who but himself really knew what he after all hadn t or even had gained the beauty of her condition was keeping him at any rate as he might feel in sight of the sea where thoughhis personal dips were over the whole thing could shine at him and the air and the plash and the play become for him too asensation that couldn t be fixed upon him as missing since ifit wasn t personally floating if it wasn t even sitting in thesand it could yet pass very well for breathing the bliss in acommunicated irresistible way for tasting the balm it couldpass further for knowing for knowing that without him nothingmight have been which would have been missing least of all i guess i ve never been jealous he finally remarked and itsaid more to her he had occasion next to perceive than he wasintending for it made her as by the pressure of a spring givehim a look that seemed to tell of things she couldn t speak but she at last tried for one of them oh it s you father whoare what i call beyond everything nothing can pull you down he returned the look as with the sociability of their easycommunion though inevitably throwing in this time a shade ofsolemnity he might have been seeing things to say and others whether of a type presumptuous or not doubtless better keptback so he settled on the merely obvious well then we make apair we re all right oh we re all right a declaration launched not only with allher discriminating emphasis but confirmed by her rising withdecision and standing there as if the object of their smallexcursion required accordingly no further pursuit at thisjuncture however with the act of their crossing the bar toget as might be into port there occurred the only approach toa betrayal of their having had to beat against the wind herfather kept his place and it was as if she had got over firstand were pausing for her consort to follow if they were allright they were all right yet he seemed to hesitate and waitfor some word beyond his eyes met her own suggestively and itwas only after she had contented herself with simply smiling athim smiling ever so fixedly that he spoke for the remainingimportance of it from the bench where he leaned back raisinghis face to her his legs thrust out a trifle wearily and hishands grasping either side of the seat they had beaten againstthe wind and she was still fresh they had beaten against thewind and he as at the best the more battered vessel perhapsjust vaguely drooped but the effect of their silence was thatshe appeared to beckon him on and he might have been fairlyalongside of her when at the end of another minute he foundtheir word the only thing is that as for ever putting up againwith your pretending that you re selfish at this she helped him out with it you won t take it from me i won t take it from you well of course you won t for that s your way it doesn tmatter and it only proves but it doesn t matter either whatit proves i m at this very moment she declared frozen stiffwith selfishness he faced her awhile longer in the same way it was strangely asif by this sudden arrest by their having in their acceptanceof the unsaid or at least their reference to it practicallygiven up pretending it was as if they were in for it forsomething they had been ineffably avoiding but the dread ofwhich was itself in a manner a seduction just as anyconfession of the dread was by so much an allusion then sheseemed to see him let himself go when a person s of the natureyou speak of there are always other persons to suffer but you vejust been describing to me what you d take if you had once agood chance from your husband oh i m not talking about my husband then whom are you talking about both the retort and the rejoinder had come quicker than anythingpreviously exchanged and they were followed on maggie s part by a momentary drop but she was not to fall away and while hercompanion kept his eyes on her while she wondered if he weren texpecting her to name his wife then with high hypocrisy aspaying for his daughter s bliss she produced something that shefelt to be much better i m talking about you do you mean i ve been your victim of course you ve been my victim what have you done ever done that hasn t been for me many things more than i can tell you things you ve only tothink of for yourself what do you make of all that i ve done formyself yourself she brightened out with derision what do you make of what i ve done for american city it took her but a moment to say i m not talking of you as apublic character i m talking of you on your personal side well american city if personalities can do it has given mea pretty personal side what do you make he went on of whati ve done for my reputation your reputation there you ve given it up to them the awfulpeople for less than nothing you ve given it up to them to tearto pieces to make their horrible vulgar jokes against you with ah my dear i don t care for their horrible vulgar jokes adamverver almost artlessly urged then there exactly you are she triumphed everything thattouches you everything that surrounds you goes on by yoursplendid indifference and your incredible permission at yourexpense just as he had been sitting he looked at her an instant longer then he slowly rose while his hands stole into his pockets andstood there before her of course my dear you go on at myexpense it has never been my idea he smiled that you shouldwork for your living i wouldn t have liked to see it withwhich for a little again they remained face to face saytherefore i have had the feelings of a father how have they mademe a victim because i sacrifice you but to what in the world at this it hung before her that she should have had as never yether opportunity to say and it held her for a minute as in avise her impression of his now with his strained smile whichtouched her to deepest depths sounding her in his secret unrest this was the moment in the whole process of their mutualvigilance in which it decidedly most hung by a hair that theirthin wall might be pierced by the lightest wrong touch it shookbetween them this transparency with their very breath it wasan exquisite tissue but stretched on a frame and would give waythe next instant if either so much as breathed too hard she heldher breath for she knew by his eyes the light at the heart ofwhich he couldn t blind that he was by his intention makingsure sure whether or no her certainty was like his theintensity of his dependence on it at that moment this itself waswhat absolutely convinced her so that as if perched up beforehim on her vertiginous point and in the very glare of hisobservation she balanced for thirty seconds she almost rocked she might have been for the time in all her conscious person the very form of the equilibrium they were in their differentways equally trying to save and they were saving it yes theywere or at least she was that was still the workable issue shecould say as she felt her dizziness drop she held herself hard the thing was to be done once for all by her acting now whereshe stood so much was crowded into so short a space that sheknew already she was keeping her head she had kept it by thewarning of his eyes she shouldn t lose it again she knew howand why and if she had turned cold this was precisely whathelped her he had said to himself she ll break down and nameamerigo she ll say it s to him she s sacrificing me and its bywhat that will give me with so many other things too that mysuspicion will be clinched he was watching her lips spying forthe symptoms of the sound whereby these symptoms had only tofail and he would have got nothing that she didn t measure out tohim as she gave it she had presently in fact so recoveredherself that she seemed to know she could more easily have madehim name his wife than he have made her name her husband it wasthere before her that if she should so much as force him just notconsciously to avoid saying charlotte charlotte he would havegiven himself away but to be sure of this was enough for her and she saw more clearly with each lapsing instant what they wereboth doing he was doing what he had steadily been coming to hewas practically offering himself pressing himself upon her as asacrifice he had read his way so into her best possibility andwhere had she already for weeks and days past planted her feetif not on her acceptance of the offer cold indeed colder andcolder she turned as she felt herself suffer this close personalvision of his attitude still not to make her weaken that was hervery certitude the intensity of his pressure for if somethingdreadful hadn t happened there wouldn t for either of them bethese dreadful things to do she had meanwhile as well theimmense advantage that she could have named charlotte withoutexposing herself as for that matter she was the next minuteshowing him why i sacrifice you simply to everything and to every one itake the consequences of your marriage as perfectly natural he threw back his head a little settling with one hand hiseyeglass what do you call my dear the consequences your life as your marriage has made it well hasn t it made it exactly what we wanted she justhesitated then felt herself steady oh beyond what she haddreamed exactly what i wanted yes his eyes through his straightened glasses were still on hers and he might with his intenser fixed smile have been knowingshe was for herself rightly inspired what do you make then ofwhat i wanted i don t make anything any more than of what you ve got that sexactly the point i don t put myself out to do so i never have i take from you all i can get all you ve provided for me and ileave you to make of your own side of the matter what you can there you are the rest is your own affair i don t even pretendto concern myself to concern yourself he watched her as she faintly faltered looking about her now so as not to keep always meeting his face with what may have really become of you it s as if we hadagreed from the first not to go into that such an arrangementbeing of course charming for me you can t say you know that ihaven t stuck to it he didn t say so then even with the opportunity given him of herstopping once more to catch her breath he said instead oh mydear oh oh but it made no difference know as she might what a past stillso recent and yet so distant it alluded to she repeated herdenial warning him off on her side from spoiling the truth ofher contention i never went into anything and you see i don t i ve continued to adore you but what s that from a decentdaughter to such a father what but a question of convenientarrangement our having two houses three houses instead of one you would have arranged for fifty if i had wished and mymaking it easy for you to see the child you don t claim isuppose that my natural course once you had set up foryourself would have been to ship you back to american city these were direct inquiries they quite rang out in the soft wooded air so that adam verver for a minute appeared to meetthem with reflection she saw reflection however quickly enoughshow him what to do with them do you know mag what you makeme wish when you talk that way and he waited again while shefurther got from him the sense of something that had been behind deeply in the shade coming cautiously to the front and justfeeling its way before presenting itself you regularly make mewish that i had shipped back to american city when you go on asyou do but he really had to hold himself to say it well when i go on why you make me quite want to ship back myself you make mequite feel as if american city would be the best place for us it made her all too finely vibrate for us for me and charlotte do you know that if we should ship itwould serve you quite right with which he smiled oh he smiled and if you say much more we will ship ah then it was that the cup of her conviction full to the brim overflowed at a touch there was his idea the clearness of whichfor an instant almost dazzled her it was a blur of light in themidst of which she saw charlotte like some object marked bycontrast in blackness saw her waver in the field of vision sawher removed transported doomed and he had named charlotte named her again and she had made him which was all she hadneeded more it was as if she had held a blank letter to the fireand the writing had come out still larger than she hoped therecognition of it took her some seconds but she might when shespoke have been folding up these precious lines and restoringthem to her pocket well i shall be as much as ever then thecause of what you do i haven t the least doubt of your being upto that if you should think i might get anything out of it eventhe little pleasure she laughed of having said as you callit more let my enjoyment of this therefore at any price continue to represent for you what i call sacrificing you she had drawn a long breath she had made him do it all for her and had lighted the way to it without his naming her husband that silence had been as distinct as the sharp the inevitablesound and something now in him followed it up a sudden air asof confessing at last fully to where she was and of begging theparticular question don t you think then i can take care ofmyself ah it s exactly what i ve gone upon if it wasn t for that but she broke off and they remained only another moment face toface i ll let you know my dear the day i feel you ve begunto sacrifice me begun she extravagantly echoed well it will be for me the day you ve ceased to believe inme with which his glasses still fixed on her his hands in hispockets his hat pushed back his legs a little apart he seemedto plant or to square himself for a kind of assurance it hadoccurred to him he might as well treat her to in default ofother things before they changed their subject it had theeffect for her of a reminder a reminder of all he was of allhe had done of all above and beyond his being her perfectlittle father she might take him as representing take him ashaving quite eminently in the eyes of two hemispheres beencapable of and as therefore wishing not was it illegitimately to call her attention to the successful beneficent person the beautiful bountiful original dauntlessly wilful great citizen the consummate collector andinfallible high authority he had been and still was these thingsstruck her on the spot as making up for him in a wonderfulway a character she must take into account in dealing with himeither for pity or for envy he positively under the impression seemed to loom larger than life for her so that she saw himduring these moments in a light of recognition which had had itsbrightness for her at many an hour of the past but which hadnever been so intense and so almost admonitory his veryquietness was part of it now as always part of everything ofhis success his originality his modesty his exquisite publicperversity his inscrutable incalculable energy and thisquality perhaps it might be all the more too as the result forthe present occasion of an admirable traceable effort thatplaced him in her eyes as no precious a work of art probably hadever been placed in his own there was a long moment absolutely during which her impression rose and rose even as that of thetypical charmed gazer in the still museum before the named anddated object the pride of the catalogue that time has polishedand consecrated extraordinary in particular was the number ofthe different ways in which he thus affected her as showing hewas strong that was the great thing he was sure sure forhimself always whatever his idea the expression of that in himhad somehow never appeared more identical with his proved tastefor the rare and the true but what stood out beyond everythingwas that he was always marvellously young which couldn t butcrown at this juncture his whole appeal to her imagination before she knew it she was lifted aloft by the consciousness thathe was simply a great and deep and high little man and that tolove him with tenderness was not to be distinguished a whit from loving him with pride it came to her all strangely as asudden an immense relief the sense that he wasn t a failure and could never be purged their predicament of every meanness made it as if they had really emerged in their transmuted union to smile almost without pain it was like a new confidence andafter another instant she knew even still better why wasn t itbecause now also on his side he was thinking of her as hisdaughter was trying her during these mute seconds as the childof his blood oh then if she wasn t with her little consciouspassion the child of any weakness what was she but strongenough too it swelled in her fairly it raised her higher higher she wasn t in that case a failure either hadn t been but the contrary his strength was her strength her pride washis and they were decent and competent together this was all inthe answer she finally made him i believe in you more than any one than any one at all she hesitated for all it might mean but there was oh athousand times no doubt of it than any one at all she keptnothing of it back now met his eyes over it let him have thewhole of it after which she went on and that s the way ithink you believe in me he looked at her a minute longer but his tone at last was right about the way yes well then she spoke as for the end and for other matters for anything everything else there might be they would neverreturn to it well then his hands came out and while her own took them hedrew her to his breast and held her he held her hard and kepther long and she let herself go but it was an embrace that august and almost stern produced for all its intimacy norevulsion and broke into no inconsequence of tears xxxviiimaggie was to feel after this passage how they had both beenhelped through it by the influence of that accident of her havingbeen caught a few nights before in the familiar embrace of herfather s wife his return to the saloon had chanced to coincideexactly with this demonstration missed moreover neither by herhusband nor by the assinghams who their card party suspended had quitted the billiard room with him she had been consciousenough at the time of what such an impression received by theothers might in that extended state do for her case and nonethe less that as no one had appeared to wish to be the first tomake a remark about it it had taken on perceptibly the specialshade of consecration conferred by unanimities of silence theeffect she might have considered had been almost awkward thepromptitude of her separation from charlotte as if they had beendiscovered in some absurdity on her becoming aware ofspectators the spectators on the other hand that was theappearance mightn t have supposed them in the existingrelation addicted to mutual endearments and yet hesitatingwith a fine scruple between sympathy and hilarity must have feltthat almost any spoken or laughed comment could be kept fromsounding vulgar only by sounding beyond any permitted measure intelligent they had evidently looked the two young wives likea pair of women making up effusively as women were supposed todo especially when approved fools after a broil but takingnote of the reconciliation would imply on her father s part onamerigo s and on fanny assingham s some proportionate vision ofthe grounds of their difference there had been something therehad been but too much in the incident for each observer yetthere was nothing any one could have said without seemingessentially to say see see the dear things their quarrel sblissfully over our quarrel what quarrel the dear thingsthemselves would necessarily in that case have demanded andthe wits of the others would thus have been called upon for someagility of exercise no one had been equal to the flight ofproducing off hand a fictive reason for any estrangement totake that is the place of the true which had so long for thefiner sensibility pervaded the air and every one accordingly not to be inconveniently challenged was pretending immediatelyafter to have remarked nothing that any one else hadn t maggie s own measure had remained all the same full of thereflection caught from the total inference which had acted virtually by enabling every one present and oh charlotte notleast to draw a long breath the message of the little scenehad been different for each but it had been this markedly allround that it reinforced reinforced even immensely the generaleffort carried on from week to week and of late distinctly moresuccessful to look and talk and move as if nothing in life werethe matter supremely however while this glass was held up toher had maggie s sense turned to the quality of the successconstituted on the spot for charlotte most of all if she wasguessing how her father must have secretly started how herhusband must have secretly wondered how fanny assingham musthave secretly in a flash seen daylight for herself most of allhad she tasted by communication of the high profit involved forher companion she felt in all her pulses charlotte feel it and how publicity had been required absolutely to crown her ownabasement it was the added touch and now nothing was wanting which to do her stepmother justice mrs verver had appeared butto desire from that evening to show with the last vividness that she recognised maggie lived over again the minutes inquestion had found herself repeatedly doing so to the degreethat the whole evening hung together to her aftersense as

their game of bridge however abysmal a face ithad worn for her give way precisely to their common unavowedimpulse to find out to emulate charlotte s impatience apreoccupation this latter attached detectedly to the member ofthe party who was roaming in her queerness and was for all theirsimulated blindness not roaming unnoted if mrs verver meanwhile then had struck her as determined in acertain direction by the last felicity into which that night hadflowered our young woman was yet not to fail of appreciating thetruth that she had not been put at ease after all with absolutepermanence maggie had seen her unmistakably desire to rise tothe occasion and be magnificent seen her decide that the rightway for this would be to prove that the reassurance she hadextorted there under the high cool lustre of the saloon atwinkle of crystal and silver had not only poured oil upon thetroubled waters of their question but had fairly drenched theirwhole intercourse with that lubricant she had exceeded the limitof discretion in this insistence on her capacity to repay inproportion a service she acknowledged as handsome whyhandsome maggie would have been free to ask since if she hadbeen veracious the service assuredly would not have been huge itwould in that case have come up vividly and for each of themalike that the truth on the princess s lips presented nodifficulty if the latter s mood in fact could have turneditself at all to private gaiety it might have failed to resistthe diversion of seeing so clever a creature so beguiled charlotte s theory of a generous manner was manifestly to expressthat her stepdaughter s word wiping out as she might have said everything had restored them to the serenity of a relationwithout a cloud it had been in short in this light ideallyconclusive so that no ghost of anything it referred to couldever walk again what was the ecstasy of that however but initself a trifle compromising as truly within the week maggiehad occasion to suspect her friend of beginning and ratherabruptly to remember convinced as she was of the examplealready given her by her husband and in relation to which herprofession of trust in his mistress had been an act of conformityexquisitely calculated her imagination yet sought in the hiddenplay of his influence the explanation of any change of surface any difference of expression or intention there had been through life as we know few quarters in which the princess sfancy could let itself loose but it shook off restraint when itplunged into the figured void of the detail of that relation this was a realm it could people with images again and againwith fresh ones they swarmed there like the strange combinationsthat lurked in the woods at twilight they loomed into thedefinite and faded into the vague their main present sign forher being however that they were always that they wereduskily agitated her earlier vision of a state of bliss madeinsecure by the very intensity of the bliss this had droppedfrom her she had ceased to see as she lost herself the pair ofoperatic of high wagnerian lovers she found deep within her these comparisons interlocked in their wood of enchantment agreen glade as romantic as one s dream of an old german forest the picture was veiled on the contrary with the dimness oftrouble behind which she felt indistinguishable the processionof forms that had lost all so pitifully their preciousconfidence therefore though there was in these days for her with amerigo little enough even of the imitation from day today of unembarrassed references as she had foreseen for thatmatter from the first that there would be her activeconception of his accessibility to their companion s own privateand unextinguished right to break ground was not much less activethan before so it was that her inner sense in spite ofeverything represented him as still pulling wires andcontrolling currents or rather indeed as muffling the wholepossibility keeping it down and down leading his accomplicecontinually on to some new turn of the road as regards herselfmaggie had become more conscious from week to week of hisingenuities of intention to make up to her for their forfeiture in so dire a degree of any reality of frankness a privationthat had left on his lips perhaps a little of the same thirstwith which she fairly felt her own distorted the torment of thelost pilgrim who listens in desert sands for the possible theimpossible plash of water it was just this hampered state inhim none the less that she kept before her when she wished mostto find grounds of dignity for the hard little passion whichnothing he had done could smother there were hours enough lonely hours in which she let dignity go then there were otherswhen clinging with her winged concentration to some deep cell ofher heart she stored away her hived tenderness as if she hadgathered it all from flowers he was walking ostensibly besideher but in fact given over without a break to the grey mediumin which he helplessly groped a perception on her part which wasa perpetual pang and which might last what it would for ever ifneed be but which if relieved at all must be relieved by hisact alone she herself could do nothing more for it she had donethe utmost possible it was meantime not the easier to bear forthis aspect under which charlotte was presented as depending onhim for guidance taking it from him even in doses of bitterness and yet lost with him in devious depths nothing was thus moresharply to be inferred than that he had promptly enough warnedher on hearing from her of the precious assurance received fromhis wife that she must take care her satisfaction didn t betraysomething of her danger maggie had a day of still waiting afterallowing him time to learn how unreservedly she had lied forhim of waiting as for the light of she scarce knew what slow shining reflection of this knowledge in his personal attitude what retarded evolution she asked herself in these hours mightn t poor charlotte all unwittingly have precipitated shewas thus poor charlotte again for maggie even while maggie s ownhead was bowed and the reason for this kept coming back to ouryoung woman in the conception of what would secretly have passed she saw her face to face with the prince take from him thechill of his stiffest admonition with the possibilities ofdeeper difficulty that it represented for each she heard herask irritated and sombre what tone in god s name since herbravery didn t suit him she was then to adopt and by way of afantastic flight of divination she heard amerigo reply in avoice of which every fine note familiar and admirable came hometo her that one must really manage such prudences a little forone s self it was positive in the princess that for this shebreathed charlotte s cold air turned away from him in it withher turned with her in growing compassion this way and that hovered behind her while she felt her ask herself where then sheshould rest marvellous the manner in which under suchimaginations maggie thus circled and lingered quite as if shewere materially following her unseen counting every step shehelplessly wasted noting every hindrance that brought her to apause a few days of this accordingly had wrought a change in thatapprehension of the instant beatitude of triumph of triumphmagnanimous and serene with which the upshot of the night sceneon the terrace had condemned our young woman to make terms shehad had as we know her vision of the gilt bars bent of thedoor of the cage forced open from within and the creatureimprisoned roaming at large a movement on the creature s part that was to have even for the short interval its impressivebeauty but of which the limit and in yet another direction hadloomed straight into view during her last talk under the greattrees with her father it was when she saw his wife s faceruefully attached to the quarter to which in the course of theirsession he had so significantly addressed his own it was thenthat maggie could watch for its turning pale it was then sheseemed to know what she had meant by thinking of her in sheshadow of his most ominous reference as doomed if as i say her attention now day after day so circled and hovered itfound itself arrested for certain passages during which sheabsolutely looked with charlotte s grave eyes what sheunfailingly made out through them was the figure of a littlequiet gentleman who mostly wore as he moved alone across thefield of vision a straw hat a white waistcoat and a bluenecktie keeping a cigar in his teeth and his hands in hispockets and who oftener than not presented a somewhatmeditative back while he slowly measured the perspectives of thepark and broodingly counted it might have appeared his steps there were hours of intensity for a week or two when it was forall the world as if she had guardedly tracked her stepmother inthe great house from room to room and from window to window only to see her here and there and everywhere try her uneasyoutlook question her issue and her fate something unmistakably had come up for her that had never come up before it represented a new complication and had begotten a newanxiety things these that she carried about with her done upin the napkin of her lover s accepted rebuke while she vainlyhunted for some corner where she might put them safely down thedisguised solemnity the prolonged futility of her search mighthave been grotesque to a more ironic eye but maggie s provisionof irony which we have taken for naturally small had never beenso scant as now and there were moments while she watched withher thus unseen when the mere effect of being near her was tofeel her own heart in her throat was to be almost moved tosaying to her hold on tight my poor dear without too muchterror and it will all come out somehow even to that indeed she could reflect charlotte might havereplied that it was easy to say even to that no great meaningcould attach so long as the little meditative man in the strawhat kept coming into view with his indescribable air of weavinghis spell weaving it off there by himself in whatever quarterof the horizon the appearances were scanned he was to be noticedas absorbed in this occupation and maggie was to become aware oftwo or three extraordinary occasions of receiving from him thehint that he measured the impression he produced it was notreally till after their recent long talk in the park that sheknew how deeply how quite exhaustively they had thencommunicated so that they were to remain together for the time in consequence quite in the form of a couple of sociabledrinkers who sit back from the table over which they have beenresting their elbows over which they have emptied to the lastdrop their respective charged cups the cups were still there onthe table but turned upside down and nothing was left for thecompanions but to confirm by placid silences the fact that thewine had been good they had parted positively as if on eitherside primed with it primed for whatever was to be andeverything between them as the month waned added its touch oftruth to this similitude nothing truly was at present betweenthem save that they were looking at each other in infinite trust it fairly wanted no more words and when they met during thedeep summer days met even without witnesses when they kissed atmorning and evening or on any of the other occasions of contactthat they had always so freely celebrated a pair of birds of theupper air could scarce have appeared less to invite each other tosit down and worry afresh so it was that in the house itself where more of his waiting treasures than ever were provisionallyranged she sometimes only looked at him from end to end of thegreat gallery the pride of the house for instance as if inone of the halls of a museum she had been an earnest young woman with a baedeker and he a vague gentleman to whom even baedekerswere unknown he had ever of course had his way of walkingabout to review his possessions and verify their condition butthis was a pastime to which he now struck her as almostextravagantly addicted and when she passed near him and heturned to give her a smile she caught or so she fancied thegreater depth of his small perpetual hum of contemplation itwas as if he were singing to himself sotto voce as he went andit was also on occasion quite ineffably as if charlotte hovering watching listening on her side too kept sufficientlywithin earshot to make it out as song and yet for some reasonconnected with the very manner of it stood off and didn t dare one of the attentions she had from immediately after her marriagemost freely paid him was that of her interest in his rarities her appreciation of his taste her native passion for beautifulobjects and her grateful desire not to miss anything he couldteach her about them maggie had in due course seen her beginto work this fortunately natural source of sympathy for all itwas worth she took possession of the mound throughout itsextent she abounded to odd excess one might have remarked inthe assumption of its being for her with her husband all theground the finest clearest air and most breathable mediumcommon to them it had been given to maggie to wonder if shedidn t in these intensities of approbation too much shut him upto his province but this was a complaint he had never made hisdaughter and charlotte must at least have had for her that thanks to her admirable instinct her range of perceptionmarching with his own and never falling behind she had probablynot so much as once treated him to a rasping mistake or arevealing stupidity maggie wonderfully in the summer days felt it forced upon her that that was one way after all ofbeing a genial wife and it was never so much forced upon her asat these odd moments of her encountering the sposi as amerigocalled them under the coved ceilings of fawns while sotogether yet at the same time so separate they were makingtheir daily round charlotte hung behind with emphasisedattention she stopped when her husband stopped but at thedistance of a case or two or of whatever other succession ofobjects and the likeness of their connection would not have beenwrongly figured if he had been thought of as holding in one ofhis pocketed hands the end of a long silken halter looped roundher beautiful neck he didn t twitch it yet it was there hedidn t drag her but she came and those indications that i havedescribed the princess as finding extraordinary in him were twoor three mute facial intimations which his wife s presence didn tprevent his addressing his daughter nor prevent his daughter asshe passed it was doubtless to be added from flushing a littleat the receipt of they amounted perhaps only to a wordless wordless smile but the smile was the soft shake of the twistedsilken rope and maggie s translation of it held in her breasttill she got well away came out only as if it might have beenoverheard when some door was closed behind her yes you see ilead her now by the neck i lead her to her doom and she doesn tso much as know what it is though she has a fear in her heartwhich if you had the chances to apply your ear there that i asa husband have you would hear thump and thump and thump shethinks it may be her doom the awful place over there awful forher but she s afraid to ask don t you see just as she s afraidof not asking just as she s afraid of so many other things thatshe sees multiplied round her now as portents and betrayals she ll know however when she does know charlotte s one opportunity meanwhile for the air of confidenceshe had formerly worn so well and that agreed so with her firmand charming type was the presence of visitors never as theseason advanced wholly intermitted rather in fact soconstant with all the people who turned up for luncheon and fortea and to see the house now replete now famous thatmaggie grew to think again of this large element of company asof a kind of renewed water supply for the tank in which like aparty of panting gold fish they kept afloat it helped them unmistakably with each other weakening the emphasis of so manyof the silences of which their intimate intercourse wouldotherwise have consisted beautiful and wonderful for her even at times was the effect of these interventions their effectabove all in bringing home to each the possible heroism ofperfunctory things they learned fairly to live in theperfunctory they remained in it as many hours of the day asmight be it took on finally the likeness of some spaciouscentral chamber in a haunted house a great overarched andoverglazed rotunda where gaiety might reign but the doors ofwhich opened into sinister circular passages here they turned upfor each other as they said with the blank faces that deniedany uneasiness felt in the approach here they closed numerousdoors carefully behind them all save the door that connected theplace as by a straight tented corridor with the outer world and encouraging thus the irruption of society imitated theaperture through which the bedizened performers of the circus arepoured into the ring the great part mrs verver had sociallyplayed came luckily maggie could make out to her assistance she had personal friends charlotte s personal friends had everbeen in london at the two houses one of the most convenientpleasantries who actually tempered at this crisis her aspectof isolation and it wouldn t have been hard to guess that herbest moments were those in which she suffered no fear of becominga bore to restrain her appeal to their curiosity their curiositymight be vague but their clever hostess was distinct and shemarched them about sparing them nothing as if she counted eachday on a harvest of half crowns maggie met her again in thegallery at the oddest hours with the party she wasentertaining heard her draw out the lesson insist upon theinterest snub even the particular presumption and smile forthe general bewilderment inevitable features these latter ofalmost any occasion in a manner that made our young woman herself incurably dazzled marvel afresh at the mystery by whicha creature who could be in some connexions so earnestly rightcould be in others so perversely wrong when her father vaguelycirculating was attended by his wife it was always charlottewho seemed to bring up the rear but he hung in the backgroundwhen she did cicerone and it was then perhaps that movingmildly and modestly to and fro on the skirts of the exhibition his appearance of weaving his spell was for the initiatedconscience least to be resisted brilliant women turned to himin vague emotion but his response scarce committed him more thanif he had been the person employed to see that after theinvading wave was spent the cabinets were all locked and thesymmetries all restored there was a morning when during the hour before luncheon andshortly after the arrival of a neighbourly contingent neighbourly from ten miles off whom mrs verver had taken incharge maggie paused on the threshold of the gallery throughwhich she had been about to pass faltered there for the veryimpression of his face as it met her from an opposite door charlotte half way down the vista held together as if bysomething almost austere in the grace of her authority thesemi scared now that they were there knot of her visitors who since they had announced themselves by telegram as yearningto inquire and admire saw themselves restricted to thisconsistency her voice high and clear and a little hard reachedher husband and her step daughter while she thus placed beyonddoubt her cheerful submission to duty her words addressed tothe largest publicity rang for some minutes through the place every one as quiet to listen as if it had been a church ablazewith tapers and she were taking her part in some hymn of praise fanny assingham looked rapt in devotion fanny assingham whoforsook this other friend as little as she forsook either herhost or the princess or the prince or the principino shesupported her in slow revolutions in murmurous attestations ofpresence at all such times and maggie advancing after a firsthesitation was not to fail of noting her solemn inscrutableattitude her eyes attentively lifted so that she might escapebeing provoked to betray an impression she betrayed one however as maggie approached dropping her gaze to the latter slevel long enough to seem to adventure marvellously on a muteappeal you understand don t you that if she didn t do thisthere would be no knowing what she might do this light mrs assingham richly launched while her younger friend unresistinglymoved became uncertain again and then not too much to showit or rather positively to conceal it and to concealsomething more as well turned short round to one of the windowsand awkwardly pointlessly waited the largest of the threepieces has the rare peculiarity that the garlands looped roundit which as you see are the finest possible vieux saxe arenot of the same origin or period or even wonderful as they are of a taste quite so perfect they have been put on at a latertime by a process of which there are very few examples and noneso important as this which is really quite unique so that though the whole thing is a little baroque its value as aspecimen is i believe almost inestimable so the high voice quavered aiming truly at effects far over theheads of gaping neighbours so the speaker piling it up sticking at nothing as less interested judges might have said seemed to justify the faith with which she was honoured maggiemeanwhile at the window knew the strangest thing to behappening she had turned suddenly to crying or was at least onthe point of it the lighted square before her all blurred anddim the high voice went on its quaver was doubtless forconscious ears only but there were verily thirty seconds duringwhich it sounded for our young woman like the shriek of a soulin pain kept up a minute longer it would break and collapse sothat maggie felt herself the next thing turn with a start toher father can t she be stopped hasn t she done it enough some such question as that she let herself ask him to suppose inher then it was that across half the gallery for he had notmoved from where she had first seen him he struck her asconfessing with strange tears in his own eyes to sharp identityof emotion poor thing poor thing it reached straight isn t she for one s credit on the swagger after which as held thus together they had still another strained minute theshame the pity the better knowledge the smothered protest thedivined anguish even so overcame him that blushing to his eyes he turned short away the affair but of a few muffled moments this snatched communion yet lifted maggie as on air so much fordeep guesses on her own side too it gave her to think of therewas honestly an awful mixture in things and it was not closedto her aftersense of such passages we have already indeed inother cases seen it open that the deepest depth of all in aperceived penalty was that you couldn t be sure some of yourcompunctions and contortions wouldn t show for ridiculous amerigo that morning for instance had been as absent as he atthis juncture appeared to desire he should mainly be noted asbeing he had gone to london for the day and the night anecessity that now frequently rose for him and that he had morethan once suffered to operate during the presence of guests successions of pretty women the theory of his fond interest inwhom had been publicly cultivated it had never occurred to hiswife to pronounce him ingenuous but there came at last a highdim august dawn when she couldn t sleep and when creepingrestlessly about and breathing at her window the coolness ofwooded acres she found the faint flush of the east march withthe perception of that other almost equal prodigy it rosilycoloured her vision that even such as he was yes her husbandcould on occasion sin by excess of candour he wouldn t otherwisehave given as his reason for going up to portland place in theaugust days that he was arranging books there he had bought agreat many of late and he had had others a large number sentfrom rome wonders of old print in which her father had beeninterested but when her imagination tracked him to the dustytown to the house where drawn blinds and pale shrouds where acaretaker and a kitchenmaid were alone in possession it wasn tto see him in his shirtsleeves unpacking battered boxes she saw him in truth less easily beguiled saw him wander inthe closed dusky rooms from place to place or else for longperiods recline on deep sofas and stare before him through thesmoke of ceaseless cigarettes she made him out as liking betterthan anything in the world just now to be alone with histhoughts being herself connected with his thoughts shecontinued to believe more than she had ever been it was therebya good deal as if he were alone with her she made him out asresting so from that constant strain of the perfunctory to whichhe was exposed at fawns and she was accessible to the impressionof the almost beggared aspect of this alternative it was likehis doing penance in sordid ways being sent to prison or beingkept without money it wouldn t have taken much to make her thinkof him as really kept without food he might have broken away might easily have started to travel he had a right thoughtwonderful maggie now to so many more freedoms than he took hissecret was of course that at fawns he all the while winced wasall the while in presences in respect to which he had thrownhimself back with a hard pressure on whatever mysteries ofpride whatever inward springs familiar to the man of the world he could keep from snapping maggie for some reason had thatmorning while she watched the sunrise taken an extraordinarymeasure of the ground on which he would have had to snatch atpretexts for absence it all came to her there he got off toescape from a sound the sound was in her own ears still that ofcharlotte s high coerced quaver before the cabinets in the hushedgallery the voice by which she herself had been pierced the daybefore as by that of a creature in anguish and by which whileshe sought refuge at the blurred window the tears had beenforced into her eyes her comprehension soared so high that thewonder for her became really his not feeling the need of widerintervals and thicker walls before that admiration she alsomeditated consider as she might now she kept reading not lessinto what he omitted than into what he performed a beauty ofintention that touched her fairly the more by being obscure itwas like hanging over a garden in the dark nothing was to bemade of the confusion of growing things but one felt they werefolded flowers and their vague sweetness made the whole airtheir medium he had to turn away but he wasn t at least acoward he would wait on the spot for the issue of what he haddone on the spot she sank to her knees with her arm on the ledgeof her window seat where she blinded her eyes from the fullglare of seeing that his idea could only be to wait whatevermight come at her side it was to her buried face that she thus for a long time felt him draw nearest though after a while when the strange wail of the gallery began to repeat itsinevitable echo she was conscious of how that brought out hispale hard grimace xxxixthe resemblance had not been present to her on first coming outinto the hot still brightness of the sunday afternoon only thesecond sunday of all the summer when the party of six theparty of seven including the principino had practically beenwithout accessions or invasions but within sight of charlotte seated far away very much where she had expected to find her the princess fell to wondering if her friend wouldn t be affectedquite as she herself had been that night on the terrace undermrs verver s perceptive pursuit the relation to day hadturned itself round charlotte was seeing her come throughpatches of lingering noon quite as she had watched charlottemenace her through the starless dark and there was a moment that of her waiting a little as they thus met across thedistance when the interval was bridged by a recognition not lesssoundless and to all appearance not less charged with strangemeanings than that of the other occasion the point however was that they had changed places maggie had from her window seen her stepmother leave the house at so unlikely an hour three o clock of a canicular august for a ramble in garden orgrove and had thereupon felt her impulse determined with thesame sharpness that had made the spring of her companion s threeweeks before it was the hottest day of the season and theshaded siesta for people all at their ease would certainlyrather have been prescribed but our young woman had perhaps notyet felt it so fully brought home that such refinements ofrepose among them constituted the empty chair at the feast this was the more distinct as the feast literally in the greatbedimmed dining room the cool ceremonious semblance ofluncheon had just been taking place without mrs verver she hadbeen represented but by the plea of a bad headache not reportedto the rest of the company by her husband but offered directlyto mr verver himself on their having assembled by her maid deputed for the effect and solemnly producing it maggie had sat down with the others to viands artfully iced tothe slow circulation of precious tinkling jugs to markedreserves of reference in many directions poor fanny assinghamherself scarce thrusting her nose out of the padded hollow intowhich she had withdrawn a consensus of languor which mightalmost have been taken for a community of dread ruled thescene relieved only by the fitful experiments of fathermitchell good holy hungry man a trusted and overworked londonfriend and adviser who had taken for a week or two the lightneighbouring service local rites flourishing under maggie smunificence and was enjoying as a convenience all the bountiesof the house he conversed undiscouraged father mitchell conversed mainly with the indefinite wandering smile of theentertainers and the princess s power to feel him on the whole ablessing for these occasions was not impaired by what was awkwardin her consciousness of having from the first of her trouble really found her way without his guidance she asked herself attimes if he suspected how more than subtly how perversely shehad dispensed with him and she balanced between visions of allhe must privately have guessed and certitudes that he had guessednothing whatever he might nevertheless have been so urbanelyfilling up gaps at present for the very reason that hisinstinct sharper than the expression of his face hadsufficiently served him made him aware of the thin ice figuratively speaking and of prolongations of tension roundabout him mostly foreign to the circles in which luxury was akinto virtue some day in some happier season she would confess tohim that she hadn t confessed though taking so much on herconscience but just now she was carrying in her weak stiffenedhand a glass filled to the brim as to which she had recorded avow that no drop should overflow she feared the very breath of abetter wisdom the jostle of the higher light of heavenly helpitself and in addition however that might be she drew breaththis afternoon as never yet in an element heavy to oppression something grave had happened somehow and somewhere and she had god knew her choice of suppositions her heart stood still whenshe wondered above all if the cord mightn t at last have snappedbetween her husband and her father she shut her eyes for dismayat the possibility of such a passage there moved before them theprocession of ugly forms it might have taken find out foryourself she had thrown to amerigo for her last word on thequestion of who else knew that night of the breaking of thebowl and she flattered herself that she hadn t since then helpedhim in her clear consistency by an inch it was what she hadgiven him all these weeks to be busy with and she had againand again lain awake for the obsession of this sense of hisuncertainty ruthlessly and endlessly playing with his dignity she had handed him over to an ignorance that couldn t even try tobecome indifferent and that yet wouldn t project itself either into the cleared air of conviction in proportion as he wasgenerous it had bitten into his spirit and more than once shehad said to herself that to break the spell she had cast upon himand that the polished old ivory of her father s inattackablesurface made so absolute he would suddenly commit some mistakeor some violence smash some windowpane for air fail even of oneof his blest inveteracies of taste in that way fatally hewould have put himself in the wrong blighting by a single falsestep the perfection of his outward show these shadows rose and fell for her while father mitchellprattled with other shadows as well those that hung overcharlotte herself those that marked her as a prey to equalsuspicions to the idea in particular of a change such achange as she didn t dare to face in the relations of the twomen or there were yet other possibilities as it seemed tomaggie there were always too many and all of them things ofevil when one s nerves had at last done for one all that nervescould do had left one in a darkness of prowling dangers that waslike the predicament of the night watcher in a beast haunted landwho has no more means for a fire she might with such nerves have supposed almost anything of any one anything almost ofpoor bob assingham condemned to eternal observances and solemnlyappreciating her father s wine anything verily yes of thegood priest as he finally sat back with fat folded hands andtwiddled his thumbs on his stomach the good priest looked hardat the decanters at the different dishes of dessert he eyedthem half obliquely as if they might have met him to day forconversation better than any one present but the princess hadher fancy at last about that too she was in the midst of apassage before she knew it between father mitchell andcharlotte some approach he would have attempted with her thatvery morning perhaps to the circumstance of an apparentdetachment recently noted in her from any practice of devotion he would have drawn from this say his artless inference takenit for a sign of some smothered inward trouble and pointed naturally the moral that the way out of such straits was notthrough neglect of the grand remedy he had possibly prescribedcontrition he had at any rate quickened in her the beat of thatfalse repose to which our young woman s own act had devoted herat her all so deluded instance the falsity of it had laid trapscompared to which the imputation of treachery even accepted mighthave seemed a path of roses the acceptance strangely wouldhave left her nothing to do she could have remained had sheliked all insolently passive whereas the failure to proceedagainst her as it might have been called left her everything and all the more that it was wrapped so in confidence she had toconfirm day after day the rightness of her cause and thejustice and felicity of her exemption so that wouldn t therehave been fairly in any explicit concern of father mitchell s depths of practical derision of her success the question was provisionally answered at all events by thetime the party at luncheon had begun to disperse with maggie sversion of mrs verver sharp to the point of representing herpretext for absence as a positive flight from derision she metthe good priest s eyes before they separated and priests werereally at the worst so to speak such wonderful people that shebelieved him for an instant on the verge of saying to her inabysmal softness go to mrs verver my child you go you llfind that you can help her this didn t come however nothingcame but the renewed twiddle of thumbs over the satisfied stomachand the full flush the comical candour of reference to the handemployed at fawns for mayonnaise of salmon nothing came but thereceding backs of each of the others her father s slightly bentshoulders in especial which seemed to weave his spell by theforce of habit not less patiently than if his wife had beenpresent her husband indeed was present to feel anything theremight be to feel which was perhaps exactly why this personagewas moved promptly to emulate so definite an example of sloping he had his occupations books to arrange perhaps evenat fawns the idea of the siesta moreover in all theconditions had no need to be loudly invoked maggie was in theevent left alone for a minute with mrs assingham who afterwaiting for safety appeared to have at heart to make ademonstration the stage of talking over had long passed forthem when they communicated now it was on quite ultimate facts but fanny desired to testify to the existence on her part of anattention that nothing escaped she was like the kind lady who happening to linger at the circus while the rest of thespectators pour grossly through the exits falls in with theoverworked little trapezist girl the acrobatic supportpresumably of embarrassed and exacting parents and gives her asan obscure and meritorious artist assurance of benevolentinterest what was clearest always in our young woman simaginings was the sense of being herself left for anyoccasion in the breach she was essentially there to bear theburden in the last resort of surrounding omissions andevasions and it was eminently to that office she had been to dayabandoned with this one alleviation as appeared of mrs assingham s keeping up with her mrs assingham suggested thatshe too was still on the ramparts though her gallantry provedindeed after a moment to consist not a little of her curiosity she had looked about and seen their companions beyond earshot don t you really want us to go maggie found a faint smile do you really want to it made her friend colour well then no but we would youknow at a look from you we d pack up and be off as asacrifice ah make no sacrifice said maggie see me through that s it that s all i want i should be too base besides fanny went on you re too splendid splendid splendid also you know you are all but through you ve doneit said mrs assingham but maggie only half took it from her what does it strike you that i ve done what you wanted they re going maggie continued to look at her is that what i wanted oh it wasn t for you to say that was his business my father s maggie asked after an hesitation your father s he has chosen and now she knows she sees it allbefore her and she can t speak or resist or move a littlefinger that s what s the matter with her said fanny assingham it made a picture somehow for the princess as they stoodthere the picture that the words of others whatever they mightbe always made for her even when her vision was alreadycharged better than any words of her own she saw round abouther through the chinks of the shutters the hard glare ofnature saw charlotte somewhere in it virtually at bay and yetdenied the last grace of any protecting truth she saw her offsomewhere all unaided pale in her silence and taking in herfate has she told you she then asked her companion smiled superior i don t need to be told either i see something thank god every day and then asmaggie might appear to be wondering what for instance i seethe long miles of ocean and the dreadful great country stateafter state which have never seemed to me so big or so terrible i see them at last day by day and step by step at the far end and i see them never come back but never simply i see theextraordinary interesting place which i ve never been to youknow and you have and the exact degree in which she will beexpected to be interested she will be maggie presently replied expected interested for a little after this their eyes met on it at the end ofwhich fanny said she ll be yes what she ll have to be and itwill be won t it for ever and ever she spoke as abounding inher friend s sense but it made maggie still only look at her these were large words and large visions all the more that now really they spread and spread in the midst of them however mrs assingham had soon enough continued when i talk of knowing indeed i don t mean it as you would have a right todo you know because you see and i don t see him i don t makehim out she almost crudely confessed maggie again hesitated you mean you don t make out amerigo but fanny shook her head and it was quite as if as an appeal toone s intelligence the making out of amerigo had in spite ofeverything long been superseded then maggie measured the reachof her allusion and how what she next said gave her meaning arichness no other name was to be spoken and mrs assingham hadtaken that without delay from her eyes with a discretion still that fell short but by an inch you know how he feels maggie at this then slowly matched her headshake i knownothing you know how you feel but again she denied it i know nothing if i did well if you did fanny asked as she faltered she had had enough however i should die she said as sheturned away she went to her room through the quiet house she roamed there amoment picking up pointlessly a different fan and then tookher way to the shaded apartments in which at this hour theprincipino would be enjoying his nap she passed through thefirst empty room the day nursery and paused at an open door the inner room large dim and cool was equally calm her boy sample antique historical royal crib consecrated reputedly by the guarded rest of heirs apparent and a gift early in hiscareer from his grandfather ruled the scene from the centre inthe stillness of which she could almost hear the child s softbreathing the prime protector of his dreams was installed besidehim her father sat there with as little motion with head thrownback and supported with eyes apparently closed with the finefoot that was so apt to betray nervousness at peace upon theother knee with the unfathomable heart folded in the constantflawless freshness of the white waistcoat that could alwaysreceive in its armholes the firm prehensile thumbs mrs noblehad majestically melted and the whole place signed her temporaryabdication yet the actual situation was regular and maggielingered but to look she looked over her fan the top of whichwas pressed against her face long enough to wonder if her fatherreally slept or if aware of her he only kept consciously quiet did his eyes truly fix her between lids partly open and was sheto take this his forebearance from any question only as a signagain that everything was left to her she at all events for aminute watched his immobility then as if once more renewingher total submission returned without a sound to her ownquarters a strange impulse was sharp in her but it was not for her part the desire to shift the weight she could as little have slept asshe could have slept that morning days before when she hadwatched the first dawn from her window turned to the east thisside of her room was now in shade with the two wings of thecasement folded back and the charm she always found in herseemingly perched position as if her outlook from above thehigh terraces was that of some castle tower mounted on a rock when she stood there she hung over over the gardens and thewoods all of which drowsed below her at this hour in theimmensity of light the miles of shade looked hot the banks offlowers looked dim the peacocks on the balustrades let theirtails hang limp and the smaller birds lurked among the leaves nothing therefore would have appeared to stir in the brilliantvoid if maggie at the moment she was about to turn away had notcaught sight of a moving spot a clear green sunshade in the actof descending a flight of steps it passed down from the terrace receding at a distance from sight and carried naturally soas to conceal the head and back of its bearer but maggie hadquickly recognised the white dress and the particular motion ofthis adventurer had taken in that charlotte of all people hadchosen the glare of noon for an exploration of the gardens andthat she could be betaking herself only to some unvisited quarterdeep in them or beyond them that she had already marked as asuperior refuge the princess kept her for a few minutes insight watched her long enough to feel her by the mere betrayalof her pace and direction driven in a kind of flight and thenunderstood for herself why the act of sitting still had becomeimpossible to either of them there came to her confusedly someecho of an ancient fable some vision of io goaded by the gadflyor of ariadne roaming the lone sea strand it brought with it allthe sense of her own intention and desire she too might havebeen for the hour some far off harassed heroine only with apart to play for which she knew exactly no inspiring precedent she knew but that all the while all the while of her sittingthere among the others without her she had wanted to go straightto this detached member of the party and make somehow for hersupport the last demonstration a pretext was all that wasneedful and maggie after another instant had found one she had caught a glimpse before mrs verver disappeared of hercarrying a book made out half lost in the folds of her whitedress the dark cover of a volume that was to explain her purposein case of her being met with surprise and the mate of which precisely now lay on maggie s table the book was an old novelthat the princess had a couple of days before mentioned havingbrought down from portland place in the charming original form ofits three volumes charlotte had hailed with a specious glitterof interest the opportunity to read it and our young woman had thereupon on the morrow directed her maid to carry it to mrs verver s apartments she was afterwards to observe that thismessenger unintelligent or inadvertent had removed but one ofthe volumes which happened not to be the first still possessed accordingly of the first while charlotte going out fantastically at such an hour to cultivate romance in anarbour was helplessly armed with the second maggie prepared onthe spot to sally forth with succour the right volume with aparasol was all she required in addition that is to thebravery of her general idea she passed again through the house unchallenged and emerged upon the terrace which she followed hugging the shade with that consciousness of turning the tableson her friend which we have already noted but so far as shewent after descending into the open and beginning to explore thegrounds mrs verver had gone still further with the increase ofthe oddity moreover of her having exchanged the protection ofher room for these exposed and shining spaces it was not fortunately however at last that by persisting in pursuit onedidn t arrive at regions of admirable shade this was the asylum presumably that the poor wandering woman had had in view several wide alleys in particular of great length denselyoverarched with the climbing rose and the honeysuckle andconverging in separate green vistas at a sort of umbrageoustemple an ancient rotunda pillared and statued niched androofed yet with its uncorrected antiquity like that ofeverything else at fawns conscious hitherto of no violence fromthe present and no menace from the future charlotte had pausedthere in her frenzy or what ever it was to be called the placewas a conceivable retreat and she was staring before her fromthe seat to which she appeared to have sunk all unwittingly asmaggie stopped at the beginning of one of the perspectives it was a repetition more than ever then of the evening on theterrace the distance was too great to assure her she had beenimmediately seen but the princess waited with her intention ascharlotte on the other occasion had waited allowing ohallowing for the difference of the intention maggie was full ofthe sense of that so full that it made her impatient whereuponshe moved forward a little placing herself in range of the eyesthat had been looking off elsewhere but that she had suddenlycalled to recognition charlotte had evidently not dreamed ofbeing followed and instinctively with her pale stare shestiffened herself for protest maggie could make that out aswell as further however that her second impression of herfriend s approach had an instant effect on her attitude theprincess came nearer gravely and in silence but fairly pausedagain to give her time for whatever she would whatever shewould whatever she could was what maggie wanted wanting aboveall to make it as easy for her as the case permitted that wasnot what charlotte had wanted the other night but this nevermattered the great thing was to allow her was fairly to producein her the sense of highly choosing at first clearly she hadbeen frightened she had not been pursued it had quickly struckher without some design on the part of her pursuer and whatmight she not be thinking of in addition but the way she had when herself the pursuer made her stepdaughter take in herspirit and her purpose it had sunk into maggie at the time thathard insistence and mrs verver had felt it and seen it andheard it sink which wonderful remembrance of pressuresuccessfully applied had naturally till now remained with her but her stare was like a projected fear that the buried treasure so dishonestly come by for which her companion s stillcountenance at the hour and afterwards had consented to serveas the deep soil might have worked up again to the surface tobe thrown back upon her hands yes it was positive that duringone of these minutes the princess had the vision of herparticular alarm it s her lie it s her lie that has mortallydisagreed with her she can keep down no longer her rebellion atit and she has come to retract it to disown it and denounceit to give me full in my face the truth instead this for aconcentrated instant maggie felt her helplessly gasp but onlyto let it bring home the indignity the pity of her state sheherself could but tentatively hover place in view the book shecarried look as little dangerous look as abjectly mild aspossible remind herself really of people she had read about instories of the wild west people who threw up their hands oncertain occasions as a sign they weren t carrying revolvers shecould almost have smiled at last troubled as she yet knewherself to show how richly she was harmless she held up hervolume which was so weak a weapon and while she continued forconsideration to keep her distance she explained with asquenched a quaver as possible i saw you come out saw you frommy window and couldn t bear to think you should find yourselfhere without the beginning of your book this is the beginning you ve got the wrong volume and i ve brought you out the right she remained after she had spoken it was like holding a parleywith a possible adversary and her intense her exalted littlesmile asked for formal leave may i come nearer now she seemedto say as to which however the next minute she sawcharlotte s reply lose itself in a strange process a thing ofseveral sharp stages which she could stand there and trace thedread after a minute had dropped from her face though discernibly enough she still couldn t believe in her having inso strange a fashion been deliberately made up to if she hadbeen made up to at least it was with an idea the idea that hadstruck her at first as necessarily dangerous that it wasn t insistently wasn t this shone from maggie with a force finallynot to be resisted and on that perception on the immense reliefso constituted everything had by the end of three minutesextraordinarily changed maggie had come out to her really because she knew her doomed doomed to a separation that was likea knife in her heart and in the very sight of heruncontrollable her blinded physical quest of a peace not to begrasped something of mrs assingham s picture of her as thrown for a grim future beyond the great sea and the great continenthad at first found fulfilment she had got away in thisfashion burning behind her almost the ships of disguise tolet her horror of what was before her play up without witnesses and even after maggie s approach had presented an innocent frontit was still not to be mistaken that she bristled with the signsof her extremity it was not to be said for them either thatthey were draped at this hour in any of her usual graces unveiled and all but unashamed they were tragic to the princessin spite of the dissimulation that with the return ofcomparative confidence was so promptly to operate how tragic in essence the very change made vivid the instant stiffening ofthe spring of pride this for possible defence if not forpossible aggression pride indeed the next moment had becomethe mantle caught up for protection and perversity she flung itround her as a denial of any loss of her freedom to be doomedwas in her situation to have extravagantly incurred a doom sothat to confess to wretchedness was by the same stroke toconfess to falsity she wouldn t confess she didn t a thousandtimes no she only cast about her and quite frankly andfiercely for something else that would give colour to her havingburst her bonds her eyes expanded her bosom heaved as sheinvoked it and the effect upon maggie was verily to wish shecould only help her to it she presently got up which seemed tomean oh stay if you like and when she had moved about awhileat random looking away looking at anything at everything buther visitor when she had spoken of the temperature and declaredthat she revelled in it when she had uttered her thanks for thebook which a little incoherently with her second volume sheperhaps found less clever than she expected when she had letmaggie approach sufficiently closer to lay untouched thetribute in question on a bench and take up obligingly itssuperfluous mate when she had done these things she sat down inanother place more or less visibly in possession of her part our young woman was to have passed in all her adventure nostranger moments for she not only now saw her companion fairlyagree to take her then for the poor little person she was findingit so easy to appear but fell in a secret responsive ecstasy to wondering if there were not some supreme abjection with whichshe might be inspired vague but increasingly brighter thispossibility glimmered on her it at last hung there adequatelyplain to charlotte that she had presented herself once more to as they said grovel and that truly made the stage large ithad absolutely within the time taken on the dazzling merit ofbeing large for each of them alike i m glad to see you alone there s something i ve been wantingto say to you i m tired said mrs verver i m tired tired it had dropped the next thing it couldn t all come atonce but maggie had already guessed what it was and the flushof recognition was in her face tired of this life the one we ve been leading you like it iknow but i ve dreamed another dream she held up her head now her lighted eyes more triumphantly rested she was finding shewas following her way maggie by the same influence sat insight of it there was something she was saving some quantity ofwhich she herself was judge and it was for a long moment evenwith the sacrifice the princess had come to make a good deallike watching her from the solid shore plunge into uncertain into possibly treacherous depths i see something else shewent on i ve an idea that greatly appeals to me i ve had itfor a long time it has come over me that we re wrong our reallife isn t here maggie held her breath ours my husband s and mine i m not speaking for you oh said maggie only praying not to be not even to appear stupid i m speaking for ourselves i m speaking charlotte broughtout for him i see for my father for your father for whom else they looked at each other hardnow but maggie s face took refuge in the intensity of herinterest she was not at all even so stupid as to treat hercompanion s question as requiring an answer a discretion thather controlled stillness had after an instant justified imust risk your thinking me selfish for of course you know whatit involves let me admit it i am selfish i place my husbandfirst well said maggie smiling and smiling since that s where iplace mine you mean you ll have no quarrel with me so much the betterthen for charlotte went on with a higher and higher flight my plan is completely formed maggie waited her glimmer had deepened her chance somehow wasat hand the only danger was her spoiling it she felt herselfskirting an abyss what then may i ask is your plan it hung fire but ten seconds it came out sharp to take himhome to his real position and not to wait do you mean a this season i mean immediately and i may as well tell you now i mean formy own time i want charlotte said to have him at last alittle to myself i want strange as it may seem to you and shegave it all its weight to keep the man i ve married and to doso i see i must act maggie with the effort still to follow the right line feltherself colour to the eyes immediately she thoughtfullyechoed as soon as we can get off the removal of everything is afterall but a detail that can always be done with money as hespends it everything can what i ask for charlotte declared is the definite break and i wish it now with which her head like her voice rose higher oh she added i know mydifficulty far down below the level of attention in she could scarce havesaid what sacred depths maggie s inspiration had come and ithad trembled the next moment into sound do you mean i m yourdifficulty you and he together since it s always with you that i ve had tosee him but it s a difficulty that i m facing if you wish toknow that i ve already faced that i propose to myself tosurmount the struggle with it none too pleasant hasn t beenfor me as you may imagine in itself charming i ve felt in itat times if i must tell you all too great and too strange anugliness yet i believe it may succeed she had risen with this mrs verver and had moved for theemphasis of it a few steps away while maggie motionless atfirst but sat and looked at her you want to take my fatherfrom me the sharp successful almost primitive wail in it made charlotteturn and this movement attested for the princess the felicity ofher deceit something in her throbbed as it had throbbed thenight she stood in the drawing room and denied that she hadsuffered she was ready to lie again if her companion would butgive her the opening then she should know she had done all charlotte looked at her hard as if to compare her face with hernote of resentment and maggie feeling this met it with thesigns of an impression that might pass for the impression ofdefeat i want really to possess him said mrs verver ihappen also to feel that he s worth it maggie rose as if to receive her oh worth it she wonderfullythrew off the tone she instantly saw again had its effect charlotteflamed aloft might truly have been believing in her passionateparade you ve thought you ve known what he s worth indeed then my dear i believe i have as i believe i stilldo she had given it maggie straight back and again it had notmissed charlotte for another moment only looked at her thenbroke into the words maggie had known they would come of whichshe had pressed the spring how i see that you loathed ourmarriage do you ask me maggie after an instant demanded charlotte had looked about her picked up the parasol she hadlaid on a bench possessed herself mechanically of one of thevolumes of the relegated novel and then more consciously flungit down again she was in presence visibly of her last word she opened her sunshade with a click she twirled it on hershoulder in her pride ask you do i need how i see shebroke out that you ve worked against me oh oh oh the princess exclaimed her companion leaving her had reached one of the archways buton this turned round with a flare you haven t worked againstme maggie took it and for a moment kept it held it with closedeyes as if it had been some captured fluttering bird pressed byboth hands to her breast then she opened her eyes to speak what does it matter if i ve failed you recognise then that you ve failed asked charlotte from thethreshold maggie waited she looked as her companion had done a momentbefore at the two books on the seat she put them together andlaid them down then she made up her mind i ve failed shesounded out before charlotte having given her time walked away she watched her splendid and erect float down the long vista then she sank upon a seat yes she had done all part sixth xl i ll do anything you like she said to her husband on one ofthe last days of the month if our being here this way at thistime seems to you too absurd or too uncomfortable or tooimpossible we ll either take leave of them now withoutwaiting or we ll come back in time three days before theystart i ll go abroad with you if you but say the word toswitzerland the tyrol the italian alps to whichever of yourold high places you would like most to see again those beautifulones that used to do you good after rome and that you so oftentold me about where they were in the conditions that prompted this offer andwhere it might indeed appear ridiculous that with the stalelondon september close at hand they should content themselveswith remaining was where the desert of portland place lookedblank as it had never looked and where a drowsy cabman scanningthe horizon for a fare could sink to oblivion of the risks ofimmobility but amerigo was of the odd opinion day after day that their situation couldn t be bettered and he even went at nomoment through the form of replying that should their ordealstrike her as exceeding their patience any step they might takewould be for her own relief this was no doubt partly becausehe stood out so wonderfully to the end against admitting by aweak word at least that any element of their existence was orever had been an ordeal no trap of circumstance no lapse of form no accident of irritation had landed him in thatinconsequence his wife might verily have suggested that he wasconsequent consequent with the admirable appearance he had fromthe first so undertaken and so continued to present rather toorigidly at her expense only as it happened she was not thelittle person to do anything of the sort and the strange tacitcompact actually in operation between them might have beenfounded on an intelligent comparison a definite collationpositively of the kinds of patience proper to each she wasseeing him through he had engaged to come out at the right endif she would see him this understanding tacitly renewed fromweek to week had fairly received with the procession of theweeks the consecration of time but it scarce needed to beinsisted on that she was seeing him on his terms not all onhers or that in other words she must allow him his unexplainedand uncharted his one practicably workable way if that way byone of the intimate felicities the liability to which was so farfrom having even yet completely fallen from him happenedhandsomely to show him as more bored than boring with advantagesof his own freely to surrender but none to be persuadedlyindebted to others for what did such a false face of the matterrepresent but the fact itself that she was pledged if she hadquestioned or challenged or interfered if she had reservedherself that right she wouldn t have been pledged whereas therewere still and evidently would be yet a while long tensestretches during which their case might have been hanging forevery eye on her possible her impossible defection she mustkeep it up to the last mustn t absent herself for three minutesfrom her post only on those lines assuredly would she showherself as with him and not against him it was extraordinary how scant a series of signs she had invitedhim to make of being of truly having been at any time with his wife that reflection she was not exempt from as they now intheir suspense supremely waited a reflection under the brush ofwhich she recognised her having had in respect to him as well to do all to go the whole way over to move indefatigably while he stood as fixed in his place as some statue of one of hisforefathers the meaning of it would seem to be she reasoned insequestered hours that he had a place and that this was anattribute somehow indefeasible unquenchable which laid uponothers from the moment they definitely wanted anything of him the necessity of taking more of the steps that he could ofcircling round him of remembering for his benefit the famousrelation of the mountain to mahomet it was strange if one hadgone into it but such a place as amerigo s was like somethingmade for him beforehand by innumerable facts facts largely ofthe sort known as historical made by ancestors examples traditions habits while maggie s own had come to show simply asthat improvised post a post of the kind spoken of asadvanced with which she was to have found herself connected inthe fashion of a settler or a trader in a new country in thelikeness even of some indian squaw with a papoose on her back andbarbarous bead work to sell maggie s own in short would havebeen sought in vain in the most rudimentary map of the socialrelations as such the only geography marking it would bedoubtless that of the fundamental passions the end that theprince was at all events holding out for was represented toexpectation by his father in law s announced departure foramerica with mrs verver just as that prospective event hadoriginally figured as advising for discretion the flight of theyounger couple to say nothing of the withdrawal of whateverother importunate company before the great upheaval of fawns this residence was to be peopled for a month by porters packersand hammerers at whose operations it had become peculiarlypublic public that is for portland place that charlotte was topreside in force operations the quite awful appointed scale andstyle of which had at no moment loomed so large to maggie s mindas one day when the dear assinghams swam back into her kenbesprinkled with sawdust and looking as pale as if they had seensamson pull down the temple they had seen at least what she wasnot seeing rich dim things under the impression of which theyhad retired she having eyes at present but for the clock bywhich she timed her husband or for the glass the image perhapswould be truer in which he was reflected to her as he timed thepair in the country the accession of their friends from cadoganplace contributed to all their intermissions at any rate acertain effect of resonance an effect especially marked by theupshot of a prompt exchange of inquiries between mrs assinghamand the princess it was noted on the occasion of that anxiouslady s last approach to her young friend at fawns that hersympathy had ventured after much accepted privation again tobecome inquisitive and it had perhaps never so yielded to thatneed as on this question of the present odd line of thedistinguished eccentrics you mean to say really that you re going to stick here andthen before maggie could answer what on earth will you do withyour evenings maggie waited a moment maggie could still tentatively smile when people learn we re here and of course the papers will befull of it they ll flock back in their hundreds from whereverthey are to catch us you see you and the colonel haveyourselves done it as for our evenings they won t i dare say be particularly different from anything else that s ours theywon t be different from our mornings or our afternoons exceptperhaps that you two dears will sometimes help us to get throughthem i ve offered to go anywhere she added to take a houseif he will but this just this and nothing else is amerigo sidea he gave it yesterday she went on a name that as hesaid described and fitted it so you see and the princessindulged again in her smile that didn t play but that only asmight have been said worked so you see there s a method in ourmadness it drew mrs assingham s wonder and what then is the name the reduction to its simplest expression of what we aredoing that s what he called it therefore as we re doingnothing we re doing it in the most aggravated way which is theway he desires with which maggie further said of course iunderstand so do i her visitor after a moment breathed you ve had tovacate the house that was inevitable but at least here hedoesn t funk our young woman accepted the expression he doesn t funk it only however half contented fanny who thoughtfully raisedher eyebrows he s prodigious but what is there as you ve fixed it to dodge unless she pursued it s her gettingnear him it s if you ll pardon my vulgarity her getting athim that she suggested may count with him but it found the princess prepared she can get near him here she can get at him she can come up can she fanny assingham questioned can t she maggie returned their eyes for a minute intimately met on it after which theelder woman said i mean for seeing him alone so do i said the princess at which fanny for her reasons couldn t help smiling oh ifit s for that he s staying he s staying i ve made it out to take anything that comes orcalls upon him to take maggie went on even that then sheput it as she had at last put it to herself he s staying forhigh decency decency mrs assingham gravely echoed decency if she should try well mrs assingham urged well i hope hope he ll see her maggie hesitated however she made no direct reply it suseless hoping she presently said she won t but he oughtto her friend s expression of a moment before which had beenapologised for as vulgar prolonged its sharpness to her ear that of an electric bell under continued pressure stated sosimply what was it but dreadful truly that the feasibility ofcharlotte s getting at the man who for so long had loved hershould now be in question strangest of all things doubtless this care of maggie s as to what might make for it or makeagainst it stranger still her fairly lapsing at moments into avague calculation of the conceivability on her own part withher husband of some direct sounding of the subject would it betoo monstrous her suddenly breaking out to him as in alarm atthe lapse of the weeks wouldn t it really seem that you rebound in honour to do something for her privately before theygo maggie was capable of weighing the risk of this adventurefor her own spirit capable of sinking to intense littleabsences even while conversing as now with the person who hadmost of her confidence during which she followed up thepossibilities it was true that mrs assingham could at suchtimes somewhat restore the balance by not wholly failing toguess her thought her thought however just at present hadmore than one face had a series that it successively presented these were indeed the possibilities involved in the adventure ofher concerning herself for the quantity of compensation that mrs verver might still look to there was always the possibility thatshe was after all sufficiently to get at him there was in factthat of her having again and again done so against this stoodnothing but fanny assingham s apparent belief in her privation more mercilessly imposed or more hopelessly felt in the actualrelation of the parties over and beyond everything that frommore than three months back of course had fostered in theprincess a like conviction these assumptions might certainly bebaseless inasmuch as there were hours and hours of amerigo stime that there was no habit no pretence of his accounting for inasmuch too as charlotte inevitably had had more than once tothe undisguised knowledge of the pair in portland place beenobliged to come up to eaton square whence so many of herpersonal possessions were in course of removal she didn t cometo portland place didn t even come to ask for luncheon on twoseparate occasions when it reached the consciousness of thehousehold there that she was spending the day in london maggiehated she scorned to compare hours and appearances to weighthe idea of whether there hadn t been moments during these days when an assignation in easy conditions a snatched interview inan air the season had so cleared of prying eyes mightn tperfectly work but the very reason of this was partly that haunted with the vision of the poor woman carrying off with suchbravery as she found to her hand the secret of her not beingappeased she was conscious of scant room for any alternativeimage the alternative image would have been that the secretcovered up was the secret of appeasement somehow obtained somehow extorted and cherished and the difference between thetwo kinds of hiding was too great to permit of a mistake charlotte was hiding neither pride nor joy she was hidinghumiliation and here it was that the princess s passion sopowerless for vindictive flights most inveterately bruised itstenderness against the hard glass of her question behind the glass lurked the whole history of the relation she hadso fairly flattened her nose against it to penetrate the glassmrs verver might at this stage have been frantically tapping from within by way of supreme irrepressible entreaty maggiehad said to herself complacently after that last passage withher stepmother in the garden of fawns that there was nothingleft for her to do and that she could thereupon fold her hands but why wasn t it still left to push further and from the pointof view of personal pride grovel lower why wasn t it stillleft to offer herself as the bearer of a message reporting to himtheir friend s anguish and convincing him of her need she could thus have translated mrs verver s tap against theglass as i have called it into fifty forms could perhaps havetranslated it most into the form of a reminder that would piercedeep you don t know what it is to have been loved and brokenwith you haven t been broken with because in your relation whatcan there have been worth speaking of to break ours waseverything a relation could be filled to the brim with the wineof consciousness and if it was to have no meaning no bettermeaning than that such a creature as you could breathe upon it at your hour for blight why was i myself dealt with all fordeception why condemned after a couple of short years to findthe golden flame oh the golden flame a mere handful of blackashes our young woman so yielded at moments to what wasinsidious in these foredoomed ingenuities of her pity that forminutes together sometimes the weight of a new duty seemed torest upon her the duty of speaking before separation shouldconstitute its chasm of pleading for some benefit that might becarried away into exile like the last saved object of price ofthe emigre the jewel wrapped in a piece of old silk andnegotiable some day in the market of misery this imagined service to the woman who could no longer helpherself was one of the traps set for maggie s spirit at everyturn of the road the click of which catching and holding thedivine faculty fast was followed inevitably by a flutter by astruggle of wings and even as we may say by a scattering offine feathers for they promptly enough felt these yearnings ofthought and excursions of sympathy the concussion that couldn tbring them down the arrest produced by the so remarkablydistinct figure that at fawns for the previous weeks wasconstantly crossing in its regular revolution the further endof any watched perspective whoever knew or whoever didn t whether or to what extent charlotte with natural business ineaton square had shuffled other opportunities under that cloak it was all matter for the kind of quiet ponderation the littleman who so kept his wandering way had made his own it was partof the very inveteracy of his straw hat and his white waistcoat of the trick of his hands in his pockets of the detachment ofthe attention he fixed on his slow steps from behind his securepince nez the thing that never failed now as an item in thepicture was that gleam of the silken noose his wife s immaterialtether so marked to maggie s sense during her last month in thecountry mrs verver s straight neck had certainly not slippedit nor had the other end of the long cord oh quiteconveniently long disengaged its smaller loop from the hookedthumb that with his fingers closed upon it her husband kept outof sight to have recognised for all its tenuity the play ofthis gathered lasso might inevitably be to wonder with what magicit was twisted to what tension subjected but could never be todoubt either of its adequacy to its office or of its perfectdurability these reminded states for the princess were in factstates of renewed gaping so many things her father knew that sheeven yet didn t all this at present with mrs assingham passed through her inquick vibrations she had expressed while the revolution of herthought was incomplete the idea of what amerigo ought on hisside in the premises to be capable of and then had felt hercompanion s answering stare but she insisted on what she hadmeant he ought to wish to see her and i mean in some protectedand independent way as he used to in case of her being herselfable to manage it that said maggie with the courage of herconviction he ought to be ready he ought to be happy he oughtto feel himself sworn little as it is for the end of such ahistory to take from her it s as if he wished to get offwithout taking anything mrs assingham deferentially mused but for what purpose is ityour idea that they should again so intimately meet for any purpose they like that s their affair fanny assingham sharply laughed then irrepressibly fell back toher constant position you re splendid perfectly splendid towhich as the princess shaking an impatient head wouldn t haveit again at all she subjoined or if you re not it s becauseyou re so sure i mean sure of him ah i m exactly not sure of him if i were sure of him ishouldn t doubt but maggie cast about her doubt what fanny pressed as she waited well that he must feel how much less than she he pays and howthat ought to keep her present to him this in its turn after an instant mrs assingham could meetwith a smile trust him my dear to keep her present but trusthim also to keep himself absent leave him his own way i ll leave him everything said maggie only you know it s mynature i think it s your nature to think too much fanny assingham a triflecoarsely risked this but quickened however in the princess the act shereprobated that may be but if i hadn t thought you wouldn t you mean have been where you are yes because they on their side thought of everything butthat they thought of everything but that i might think or even her friend too superficially concurred that yourfather might as to this at all events maggie discriminated no thatwouldn t have prevented them for they knew that his first carewould be not to make me do so as it is maggie added that hashad to become his last fanny assingham took it in deeper for what it immediately madeher give out louder he s splendid then she sounded it almostaggressively it was what she was reduced to she had positivelyto place it ah that as much as you please maggie said this and left it but the tone of it had the nextmoment determined in her friend a fresh reaction you think both of you so abysmally and yet so quietly but it s what willhave saved you oh maggie returned it s what from the moment theydiscovered we could think at all will have saved them forthey re the ones who are saved she went on we re the ones whoare lost lost lost to each other father and i and then as her friendappeared to demur oh yes maggie quite lucidly declared lostto each other much more really than amerigo and charlotte are since for them it s just it s right it s deserved while for usit s only sad and strange and not caused by our fault but idon t know she went on why i talk about myself for it s onfather it really comes i let him go said maggie you let him but you don t make him i take it from him she answered but what else can you do i take it from him the princess repeated i do what i knewfrom the first i should do i get off by giving him up but if he gives you mrs assingham presumed to object doesn t it moreover then she asked complete the very purposewith which he married that of making you and leaving you morefree maggie looked at her long yes i help him to do that mrs assingham hesitated but at last her bravery flared whynot call it then frankly his complete success well said maggie that s all that s left me to do it s a success her friend ingeniously developed with whichyou ve simply not interfered and as if to show that she spokewithout levity mrs assingham went further he has made it asuccess for them ah there you are maggie responsively mused yes she saidthe next moment that s why amerigo stays let alone it s why charlotte goes that mrs assingham andemboldened smiled so he knows but maggie hung back amerigo after which however sheblushed to her companion s recognition your father he knows what you know i mean fanny faltered well how much does he know maggie s silence and maggie s eyeshad in fact arrested the push of the question which for adecent consistency she couldn t yet quite abandon what ishould rather say is does he know how much she found it stillawkward how much i mean they did how far she touched itup they went maggie had waited but only with a question do you think hedoes know at least something oh about him i can t think he sbeyond me said fanny assingham then do you yourself know how much how much how far how far fanny had appeared to wish to make sure but there was somethingshe remembered remembered in time and even with a smile i vetold you before that i know absolutely nothing well that s what i know said the princess her friend again hesitated then nobody knows i mean mrs assingham explained how much your father does oh maggie showed that she understood nobody not a little charlotte a little the princess echoed to know anything would be forher to know enough and she doesn t know anything if she did maggie answered amerigo would and that s just it that he doesn t that s just it said the princess profoundly on which mrs assingham reflected then how is charlotte soheld just by that by her ignorance by her ignorance fanny wondered a torment a torment said maggie with tears in her eyes her companion a moment watched them but the prince then how is he held maggie asked how is he held oh i can t tell you that and the princess again broke off xlia telegram in charlotte s name arrived early we shall comeand ask you for tea at five if convenient to you am wiring forthe assinghams to lunch this document into which meanings wereto be read maggie promptly placed before her husband adding theremark that her father and his wife who would have come up theprevious night or that morning had evidently gone to an hotel the prince was in his own room where he often sat now alone half a dozen open newspapers the figaro notably as well asthe times were scattered about him but with a cigar in histeeth and a visible cloud on his brow he appeared actually to beengaged in walking to and fro never yet on thus approachinghim for she had done it of late under one necessity or another several times had a particular impression so greeted her supremely strong for some reason as he turned quickly round onher entrance the reason was partly the look in his face asuffusion like the flush of fever which brought back to herfanny assingham s charge recently uttered under that roof ofher thinking too impenetrably the word had remained with herand made her think still more so that at first as she stoodthere she felt responsible for provoking on his part anirritation of suspense at which she had not aimed she had beengoing about him these three months she perfectly knew with amaintained idea of which she had never spoken to him but whathad at last happened was that his way of looking at her onoccasion seemed a perception of the presence not of one idea but of fifty variously prepared for uses with which he somehowmust reckon she knew herself suddenly almost strangely glad tobe coming to him at this hour with nothing more abstract than atelegram but even after she had stepped into his prison underher pretext while her eyes took in his face and then embracedthe four walls that enclosed his restlessness she recognised thevirtual identity of his condition with that aspect of charlotte ssituation for which early in the summer and in all the amplitudeof a great residence she had found with so little seeking thesimilitude of the locked cage he struck her as caged the manwho couldn t now without an instant effect on her sensibilitygive an instinctive push to the door she had not completelyclosed behind her he had been turning twenty ways forimpatiences all his own and when she was once shut in with himit was yet again as if she had come to him in his more thanmonastic cell to offer him light or food there was a differencenone the less between his captivity and charlotte s thedifference as it might be of his lurking there by his own actand his own choice the admission of which had indeed virtuallybeen in his starting on her entrance as if even this were inits degree an interference that was what betrayed for her practically his fear of her fifty ideas and what had begun after a minute to make her wish to repudiate or explain it wasmore wonderful than she could have told it was for all the worldas if she was succeeding with him beyond her intention she had for these instants the sense that he exaggerated that theimputation of purpose had fairly risen too high in him she hadbegun a year ago by asking herself how she could make him thinkmore of her but what was it after all he was thinking now hekept his eyes on her telegram he read it more than once easy asit was in spite of its conveyed deprecation to understand during which she found herself almost awestruck with yearning almost on the point of marking somehow what she had marked in thegarden at fawns with charlotte that she had truly come unarmed she didn t bristle with intentions she scarce knew as he atthis juncture affected her what had become of the only intentionshe had come with she had nothing but her old idea the old onehe knew she hadn t the ghost of another presently in fact whenfour or five minutes had elapsed it was as if she positively hadn t so much even as that one he gave her back her paper asking with it if there were anything in particular she wishedhim to do she stood there with her eyes on him doubling the telegramtogether as if it had been a precious thing and yet all the whileholding her breath of a sudden somehow and quite as by theaction of their merely having between them these few writtenwords an extraordinary fact came up he was with her as if hewere hers hers in a degree and on a scale with an intensity andan intimacy that were a new and a strange quantity that werelike the irruption of a tide loosening them where they had stuckand making them feel they floated what was it that with therush of this just kept her from putting out her hands to him from catching at him as in the other time with the superficialimpetus he and charlotte had privately conspired to impart shehad so often her breath failing her known the impulse to catchat her father she did however just yet nothing inconsequent though she couldn t immediately have said what saved her and bythe time she had neatly folded her telegram she was doingsomething merely needful i wanted you simply to know so thatyou mayn t by accident miss them for it s the last saidmaggie the last i take it as their good bye and she smiled as she could alwayssmile they come in state to take formal leave they doeverything that s proper tomorrow she said they go tosouthampton if they do everything that s proper the prince presentlyasked why don t they at least come to dine she hesitated yet she lightly enough provided her answer thatwe must certainly ask them it will be easy for you but ofcourse they re immensely taken he wondered so immensely taken that they can t that yourfather can t give you his last evening in england this for maggie was more difficult to meet yet she was stillnot without her stop gap that may be what they ll propose thatwe shall go somewhere together the four of us for acelebration except that to round it thoroughly off we oughtalso to have fanny and the colonel they don t want them at tea she quite sufficiently expresses they polish them off poordears they get rid of them beforehand they want only ustogether and if they cut us down to tea she continued asthey cut fanny and the colonel down to luncheon perhaps it s forthe fancy after all of their keeping their last night in londonfor each other she said these things as they came to her she was unable to keepthem back even though as she heard herself she might have beenthrowing everything to the winds but wasn t that the right way for sharing his last day of captivity with the man one adored itwas every moment more and more for her as if she were waitingwith him in his prison waiting with some gleam of remembrance ofhow noble captives in the french revolution the darkness of theterror used to make a feast or a high discourse of their lastpoor resources if she had broken with everything now everyobservance of all the past months she must simply then take itso take it that what she had worked for was too near at last to let her keep her head she might have been losing her headverily in her husband s eyes since he didn t know all thewhile that the sudden freedom of her words was but the divertedintensity of her disposition personally to seize him he didn tknow either that this was her manner now she was with him ofbeguiling audaciously the supremacy of suspense for the peopleof the french revolution assuredly there wasn t suspense thescaffold for those she was thinking of was certain whereaswhat charlotte s telegram announced was short of someincalculable error clear liberation just the point however was in its being clearer to herself than to him her clearnesses clearances those she had so all but abjectly laboured for threatened to crowd upon her in the form of one of the clustersof angelic heads the peopled shafts of light beating downthrough iron bars that regale on occasion precisely thefevered vision of those who are in chains she was going to know she felt later on was going to know with compunction doubtless on the very morrow how thumpingly her heart hadbeaten at this foretaste of their being left together she shouldjudge at leisure the surrender she was making to theconsciousness of complications about to be bodily lifted sheshould judge at leisure even that avidity for an issue which wasmaking so little of any complication but the unextinguishedpresence of the others and indeed that she was alreadysimplifying so much more than her husband came out for her nextin the face with which he listened he might certainly well bepuzzled in respect to his father in law and mrs verver by herglance at their possible preference for a concentrated evening but it isn t is it he asked as if they were leaving eachother oh no it isn t as if they were leaving each other they re onlybringing to a close without knowing when it may open again atime that has been naturally awfully interesting to them yes she could talk so of their time she was somehow sustained shewas sustained even to affirm more intensely her presentpossession of her ground they have their reasons many thingsto think of how can one tell but there s always also thechance of his proposing to me that we shall have our last hourstogether i mean that he and i shall he may wish to take me offto dine with him somewhere alone and to do it in memory of olddays i mean the princess went on the real old days beforemy grand husband was invented and much more before his grandwife was the wonderful times of his first great interest in whathe has since done his first great plans and opportunities discoveries and bargains the way we ve sat together late everso late in foreign restaurants which he used to like the waythat in every city in europe we ve stayed on and on with ourelbows on the table and most of the lights put out to talk overthings he had that day seen or heard of or made his offer for the things he had secured or refused or lost there were placeshe took me to you wouldn t believe for often he could onlyhave left me with servants if he should carry me off with himto night for old sake s sake to the earl s court exhibition itwill be a little just a very very little like our youngadventures after which while amerigo watched her and in factquite because of it she had an inspiration to which shepresently yielded if he was wondering what she would say nextshe had found exactly the thing in that case he will leave youcharlotte to take care of in our absence you ll have to carryher off somewhere for your last evening unless you may prefer tospend it with her here i shall then see that you dine that youhave everything quite beautifully you ll be able to do as youlike she couldn t have been sure beforehand and had really not been but the most immediate result of this speech was his letting hersee that he took it for no cheap extravagance either of irony orof oblivion nothing in the world of a truth had ever been sosweet to her as his look of trying to be serious enough to makeno mistake about it she troubled him which hadn t been at allher purpose she mystified him which she couldn t help and comparatively didn t mind then it came over her that he had after all a simplicity very considerable on which she hadnever dared to presume it was a discovery not like the otherdiscovery she had once made but giving out a freshness and sherecognised again in the light of it the number of the ideas ofwhich he thought her capable they were all apparently queerfor him but she had at least with the lapse of the months created the perception that there might be something in them whereby he stared there beautiful and sombre at what she was atpresent providing him with there was something of his own in hismind to which she was sure he referred everything for ameasure and a meaning he had never let go of it from theevening weeks before when in her room after his encounterwith the bloomsbury cup she had planted it there by flinging itat him on the question of her father s view of him herdetermined find out for yourself she had been aware duringthe months that he had been trying to find out and had beenseeking above all to avoid the appearance of any evasions ofsuch a form of knowledge as might reach him with violence orwith a penetration more insidious from any other source nothing however had reached him nothing he could at allconveniently reckon with had disengaged itself for him even fromthe announcement sufficiently sudden of the final secession oftheir companions charlotte was in pain charlotte was intorment but he himself had given her reason enough for that and in respect to the rest of the whole matter of her obligationto follow her husband that personage and she maggie had soshuffled away every link between consequence and cause that theintention remained like some famous poetic line in a deadlanguage subject to varieties of interpretation what renewedthe obscurity was her strange image of their common offer to him her father s and her own of an opportunity to separate from mrs verver with the due amount of form and all the more that he was in so pathetic a way unable to treat himself to a quarrel withit on the score of taste taste in him as a touchstone was nowall at sea for who could say but that one of her fifty ideas orperhaps forty nine of them wouldn t be exactly that taste byitself the taste he had always conformed to had no importancewhatever if meanwhile at all events he felt her as serious this made the greater reason for her profiting by it as sheperhaps might never be able to profit again she was invokingthat reflection at the very moment he brought out in reply toher last words a remark which though perfectly relevant andperfectly just affected her at first as a high oddity they redoing the wisest thing you know for if they were ever togo and he looked down at her over his cigar if they were ever to go in short it was high time with herfather s age charlotte s need of initiation and the generalmagnitude of the job of their getting settled and seasoned theirlearning to live into their queer future it was high time thatthey should take up their courage this was eminent sense but itdidn t arrest the princess who the next moment had found aform for her challenge but shan t you then so much as miss hera little she s wonderful and beautiful and i feel somehow as ifshe were dying not really not physically maggie went on she s so far naturally splendid as she is from having donewith life but dying for us for you and me and making us feelit by the very fact of there being so much of her left the prince smoked hard a minute as you say she s splendid butthere is there always will be much of her left only as youalso say for others and yet i think the princess returned that it isn t as if wehad wholly done with her how can we not always think of her it s as if her unhappiness had been necessary to us as if we hadneeded her at her own cost to build us up and start us he took it in with consideration but he met it with a lucidinquiry why do you speak of the unhappiness of your father swife they exchanged a long look the time that it took her to find herreply because not to well not to would make me have to speak of him and i can t said maggie speak of him you can t i can t she said it as for definite notice not to berepeated there are too many things she nevertheless added he s too great the prince looked at his cigar tip and then as he put back theweed too great for whom upon which as she hesitated not mydear too great for you he declared for me oh as much asyou like too great for me is what i mean i know why i think it maggiesaid that s enough he looked at her yet again as if she but fanned his wonder hewas on the very point she judged of asking her why she thoughtit but her own eyes maintained their warning and at the end ofa minute he had uttered other words what s of importance isthat you re his daughter that at least we ve got and i supposethat if i may say nothing else i may say at least that i valueit oh yes you may say that you value it i myself make the most ofit this again he took in letting it presently put forth for him astriking connection she ought to have known you that s what spresent to me she ought to have understood you better better than you did yes he gravely maintained better than i did and she didn treally know you at all she doesn t know you now ah yes she does said maggie but he shook his head he knew what he meant she not onlydoesn t understand you more than i she understands you ever somuch less though even i well even you maggie pressed as he paused even i even ieven yet again he paused and the silence held them but maggie at last broke it if charlotte doesn t understand me it is that i ve prevented her i ve chosen to deceive her and tolie to her the prince kept his eyes on her i know what you ve chosen todo but i ve chosen to do the same yes said maggie after an instant my choice was made when ihad guessed yours but you mean she asked that sheunderstands you it presents small difficulty are you so sure maggie went on sure enough but it doesn t matter he waited an instant thenlooking up through the fumes of his smoke she s stupid heabruptly opined o oh maggie protested in a long wail it had made him in fact quickly change colour what i mean isthat she s not as you pronounce her unhappy and he recovered with this all his logic why is she unhappy if she doesn tknow doesn t know she tried to make his logic difficult doesn t know that you know it came from him in such a way that she was conscious instantly of three or four things to answer but what she said first was do you think that s all it need take and before he couldreply she knows she knows maggie proclaimed well then what but she threw back her head she turned impatiently away fromhim oh i needn t tell you she knows enough besides shewent on she doesn t believe us it made the prince stare a little ah she asks too much thatdrew however from his wife another moan of objection whichdetermined in him a judgment she won t let you take her forunhappy oh i know better than any one else what she won t let me takeher for very well said amerigo you ll see i shall see wonders i know i ve already seen them and i mprepared for them maggie recalled she had memories enough it s terrible her memories prompted her to speak i see it salways terrible for women the prince looked down in his gravity everything s terrible cara in the heart of man she s making her life he said she ll make it his wife turned back upon him she had wandered to a table vaguely setting objects straight a little by the way then too while she s about it she s making ours at this he raised hiseyes which met her own and she held him while she deliveredherself of some thing that had been with her these last minutes you spoke just now of charlotte s not having learned from youthat i know am i to take from you then that you accept andrecognise my knowledge he did the inquiry all the honours visibly weighed itsimportance and weighed his response you think i might have beenshowing you that a little more handsomely it isn t a question of any beauty said maggie it s only aquestion of the quantity of truth oh the quantity of truth the prince richly thoughambiguously murmured that s a thing by itself yes but there are also such things all the same as questions of good faith of course there are the prince hastened to reply after whichhe brought up more slowly if ever a man since the beginning oftime acted in good faith but he dropped it offering it simplyfor that for that then when it had had time somewhat to settle like somehandful of gold dust thrown into the air for that then maggieshowed herself as deeply and strangely taking it i see andshe even wished this form to be as complete as she could make it i see the completeness clearly after an instant had struck him asdivine ah my dear my dear my dear it was all he couldsay she wasn t talking however at large you ve kept up for solong a silence yes yes i know what i ve kept up but will you do he asked still one thing more for me it was as if for an instant with her new exposure it had madeher turn pale is there even one thing left ah my dear my dear my dear it had pressed again in him thefine spring of the unspeakable there was nothing however thatthe princess herself couldn t say i ll do anything if you lltell me what then wait and his raised italian hand with its play ofadmonitory fingers had never made gesture more expressive hisvoice itself dropped to a tone wait he repeated wait she understood but it was as if she wished to have it from him till they ve been here you mean yes till they ve gone till they re away she kept it up till they ve left the country she had her eyeson him for clearness these were the conditions of a promise sothat he put the promise practically into his response tillwe ve ceased to see them for as long as god may grant tillwe re really alone oh if it s only that when she had drawn from him thus then as she could feel the thick breath of the definite which wasthe intimate the immediate the familiar as she hadn t had themfor so long she turned away again she put her hand on the knobof the door but her hand rested at first without a grasp shehad another effort to make the effort of leaving him of whicheverything that had just passed between them his presence irresistible overcharged with it doubled the difficulty therewas something she couldn t have told what it was as if shut intogether they had come too far too far for where they were sothat the mere act of her quitting him was like the attempt torecover the lost and gone she had taken in with her somethingthat within the ten minutes and especially within the lastthree or four had slipped away from her which it was vain now wasn t it to try to appear to clutch or to pick up thatconsciousness in fact had a pang and she balanced intensely for the lingering moment almost with a terror of her endlesspower of surrender he had only to press really for her toyield inch by inch and she fairly knew at present while shelooked at him through her cloud that the confession of thisprecious secret sat there for him to pluck the sensation forthe few seconds was extraordinary her weakness her desire solong as she was yet not saving herself flowered in her face likea light or a darkness she sought for some word that would coverthis up she reverted to the question of tea speaking as if theyshouldn t meet sooner then about five i count on you on him too however something had descended as to which thisexactly gave him his chance ah but i shall see you no hesaid coming nearer she had with her hand still on the knob her back against thedoor so that her retreat under his approach must be less than astep and yet she couldn t for her life with the other hand have pushed him away he was so near now that she could touchhim taste him smell him kiss him hold him he almost pressedupon her and the warmth of his face frowning smiling shemightn t know which only beautiful and strange was bent uponher with the largeness with which objects loom in dreams sheclosed her eyes to it and so the next instant against herpurpose she had put out her hand which had met his own andwhich he held then it was that from behind her closed eyes theright word came wait it was the word of his own distress andentreaty the word for both of them all they had left theirplank now on the great sea their hands were locked and thus shesaid it again wait wait she kept her eyes shut but herhand she knew helped her meaning which after a minute she wasaware his own had absorbed he let her go he turned away withthis message and when she saw him again his back was presented as he had left her and his face staring out of the window shehad saved herself and she got off xliilater on in the afternoon before the others arrived the formof their reunion was at least remarkable they might in theirgreat eastward drawing room have been comparing notes or nervesin apprehension of some stiff official visit maggie s mind inits restlessness even played a little with the prospect thehigh cool room with its afternoon shade with its old tapestriesuncovered with the perfect polish of its wide floor reflectingthe bowls of gathered flowers and the silver and linen of theprepared tea table drew from her a remark in which this wholeeffect was mirrored as well as something else in the prince smovement while he slowly paced and turned we re distinctlybourgeois she a trifle grimly threw off as an echo of theirold community though to a spectator sufficiently detached theymight have been quite the privileged pair they were reputed granted only they were taken as awaiting the visit of royalty they might have been ready on the word passed up in advance torepair together to the foot of the staircase the prince somewhatin front advancing indeed to the open doors and even going down for all his princedom to meet on the stopping of the chariot the august emergence the time was stale it was to be admitted for incidents of magnitude the september hush was in fullpossession at the end of the dull day and a couple of the longwindows stood open to the balcony that overhung the desolation the balcony from which maggie in the springtime had seenamerigo and charlotte look down together at the hour of herreturn from the regent s park near by with her father theprincipino and miss bogle amerigo now again in his punctualimpatience went out a couple of times and stood there afterwhich as to report that nothing was in sight he returned to theroom with frankly nothing else to do the princess pretended toread he looked at her as he passed there hovered in her ownsense the thought of other occasions when she had cheatedappearances of agitation with a book at last she felt himstanding before her and then she raised her eyes do you remember how this morning when you told me of thisevent i asked you if there were anything particular you wishedme to do you spoke of my being at home but that was a matter ofcourse you spoke of something else he went on while she satwith her book on her knee and her raised eyes something thatmakes me almost wish it may happen you spoke he said of thepossibility of my seeing her alone do you know if that comes he asked the use i shall make of it and then as she waited the use is all before me ah it s your own business now said his wife but it had madeher rise i shall make it my own he answered i shall tell her i liedto her ah no she returned and i shall tell her you did she shook her head again oh still less with which therefore they stood at difference he with his headerect and his happy idea perched in its eagerness on his crest and how then is she to know she isn t to know she s only still to think you don t and therefore that i m always a fool she may think saidmaggie what she likes think it without my protest the princess made a movement what business is it of yours isn t it my right to correct her maggie let his question ring ring long enough for him to hear ithimself only then she took it up correct her and it washer own now that really rang aren t you rather forgetting whoshe is after which while he quite stared for it as it was thevery first clear majesty he had known her to use she flung downher book and raised a warning hand the carriage come the come had matched for lucid firmness the rest of herspeech and when they were below in the hall there was a go for him through the open doors and between the ranged servants that matched even that he received royalty bareheaded therefore in the persons of mr and mrs verver as it alightedon the pavement and maggie was at the threshold to welcome it toher house later on upstairs again she even herself felt stillmore the force of the limit of which she had just reminded him at tea in charlotte s affirmed presence as charlotte affirmedit she drew a long breath of richer relief it was thestrangest once more of all impressions but what she most felt for the half hour was that mr and mrs verver were making theoccasion easy they were somehow conjoined in it conjoined for apresent effect as maggie had absolutely never yet seen them andthere occurred before long a moment in which amerigo s look mether own in recognitions that he couldn t suppress the questionof the amount of correction to which charlotte had laid herselfopen rose and hovered for the instant only to sink conspicuously by its own weight so high a pitch she seemed togive to the unconsciousness of questions so resplendent a showof serenity she succeeded in making the shade of the official in her beauty and security never for a moment dropped it was acool high refuge like the deep arched recess of some colouredand gilded image in which she sat and smiled and waited drankher tea referred to her husband and remembered her mission hermission had quite taken form it was but another name for theinterest of her great opportunity that of representing the artsand the graces to a people languishing afar off in ignorance maggie had sufficiently intimated to the prince ten minutesbefore that she needed no showing as to what their friendwouldn t consent to be taken for but the difficulty now indeedwas to choose for explicit tribute of admiration between thevarieties of her nobler aspects she carried it off to put thematter coarsely with a taste and a discretion that held ouryoung woman s attention for the first quarter of an hour to thevery point of diverting it from the attitude of her overshadowed her almost superseded companion but adam verver profited indeedat this time even with his daughter by his so markedpeculiarity of seeming on no occasion to have an attitude and solong as they were in the room together she felt him still simplyweave his web and play out his long fine cord knew herself inpresence of this tacit process very much as she had known herselfat fawns he had a way the dear man wherever he was of movingabout the room noiselessly to see what it might contain andhis manner of now resorting to this habit acquainted as healready was with the objects in view expressed with a certainsharpness the intention of leaving his wife to her devices itdid even more than this it signified to the apprehension of theprincess from the moment she more directly took thought of him almost a special view of these devices as actually exhibited intheir rarity together with an independent a settledappreciation of their general handsome adequacy which scarcelyrequired the accompaniment of his faint contemplative hum charlotte throned as who should say between her hostess and herhost the whole scene having crystallised as soon as she tookher place to the right quiet lustre the harmony was not lesssustained for being superficial and the only approach to a breakin it was while amerigo remained standing long enough for hisfather in law vaguely wondering to appeal to him invite oraddress him and then in default of any such word selected forpresentation to the other visitor a plate of petits fours maggiewatched her husband if it now could be called watching offerthis refreshment she noted the consummate way for consummate was the term she privately applied in which charlotte clearedher acceptance cleared her impersonal smile of any betrayal any slightest value of consciousness and then felt the slowsurge of a vision that at the end of another minute or two hadfloated her across the room to where her father stood looking ata picture an early florentine sacred subject that he had givenher on her marriage he might have been in silence taking hislast leave of it it was a work for which he entertained sheknew an unqualified esteem the tenderness represented for herby his sacrifice of such a treasure had become to her sense apart of the whole infusion of the immortal expression thebeauty of his sentiment looked out at her always from thebeauty of the rest as if the frame made positively a window forhis spiritual face she might have said to herself at thismoment that in leaving the thing behind him held as in herclasping arms he was doing the most possible toward leaving hera part of his palpable self she put her hand over his shoulder and their eyes were held again together by the abidingfelicity they smiled in emulation vaguely as if speech failedthem through their having passed too far she would have begun towonder the next minute if it were reserved to them for the laststage to find their contact like that of old friends reunitedtoo much on the theory of the unchanged subject to shy lapses it s all right eh oh my dear rather he had applied the question to the great fact of the picture asshe had spoken for the picture in reply but it was as if theirwords for an instant afterwards symbolised another truth so thatthey looked about at everything else to give them this extension she had passed her arm into his and the other objects in theroom the other pictures the sofas the chairs the tables thecabinets the important pieces supreme in their way stoodout round them consciously for recognition and applause theireyes moved together from piece to piece taking in the wholenobleness quite as if for him to measure the wisdom of oldideas the two noble persons seated in conversation at tea fell thus into the splendid effect and the general harmony mrs verver and the prince fairly placed themselves howeverunwittingly as high expressions of the kind of human furniturerequired esthetically by such a scene the fusion of theirpresence with the decorative elements their contribution to thetriumph of selection was complete and admirable though to alingering view a view more penetrating than the occasion reallydemanded they also might have figured as concrete attestationsof a rare power of purchase there was much indeed in the tone inwhich adam verver spoke again and who shall say where histhought stopped le compte y est you ve got some good things maggie met it afresh ah don t they look well theircompanions at the sound of this gave them in a spaciousintermission of slow talk an attention all of gravity that waslike an ampler submission to the general duty of magnificence sitting as still to be thus appraised as a pair of effigies ofthe contemporary great on one of the platforms of madame tussaud i m so glad for your last look with which after maggie quite in the air had said it the notewas struck indeed the note of that strange accepted finality ofrelation as from couple to couple which almost escaped anawkwardness only by not attempting a gloss yes this was thewonder that the occasion defied insistence precisely because ofthe vast quantities with which it dealt so that separation wason a scale beyond any compass of parting to do such an hourjustice would have been in some degree to question its grounds which was why they remained in fine the four of them in theupper air united in the firmest abstention from pressure therewas no point visibly at which face to face either amerigo orcharlotte had pressed and how little she herself was in dangerof doing so maggie scarce needed to remember that her fatherwouldn t by the tip of a toe of that she was equally conscious the only thing was that since he didn t she could but hold herbreath for what he would do instead when at the end of threeminutes more he had said with an effect of suddenness well mag and the principino it was quite as if that were bycontrast the hard the truer voice she glanced at the clock i ordered him for half past five which hasn t yet struck trust him my dear not to fail you oh i don t want him to fail me was mr verver s reply yetuttered in so explicitly jocose a relation to the possibilitiesof failure that even when just afterwards he wandered in hisimpatience to one of the long windows and passed out to thebalcony she asked herself but for a few seconds if reality should she follow him would overtake or meet her there shefollowed him of necessity it came absolutely so near to hisinviting her by stepping off into temporary detachment to givethe others something of the chance that she and her husband hadso fantastically discussed beside him then while they hung overthe great dull place clear and almost coloured now colouredwith the odd sad pictured old fashioned look that emptylondon streets take on in waning afternoons of the summer s end she felt once more how impossible such a passage would have beento them how it would have torn them to pieces if they had somuch as suffered its suppressed relations to peep out of theireyes this danger would doubtless indeed have been more to bereckoned with if the instinct of each she could certainly atleast answer for her own had not so successfully acted to trumpup other apparent connexions for it connexions as to which theycould pretend to be frank you mustn t stay on here you know adam verver said as aresult of his unobstructed outlook fawns is all there for you of course to the end of my tenure but fawns so dismantled headded with mild ruefulness fawns with half its contents andhalf its best things removed won t seem to you i m afraid particularly lively no maggie answered we should miss its best things its bestthings my dear have certainly been removed to be back there she went on to be back there and she paused for the forceof her idea oh to be back there without anything good but she didn thesitate now she brought her idea forth to be back therewithout charlotte is more than i think would do and as shesmiled at him with it so she saw him the next instant take it take it in a way that helped her smile to pass all for anallusion to what she didn t and couldn t say this quantity wastoo clear that she couldn t at such an hour be pretending toname to him what it was as he would have said going to be atfawns or anywhere else to want for him that was now and in amanner exaltedly sublimely out of their compass and theirquestion so that what was she doing while they waited for theprincipino while they left the others together and their tensionjust sensibly threatened what was she doing but just offer abold but substantial substitute nothing was stranger moreover under the action of charlotte s presence than the fact of a feltsincerity in her words she felt her sincerity absolutely sound she gave it for all it might mean because charlotte dear youknow she said is incomparable it took thirty seconds butshe was to know when these were over that she had pronounced oneof the happiest words of her life they had turned from the viewof the street they leaned together against the balcony rail with the room largely in sight from where they stood but withthe prince and mrs verver out of range nothing he could try she immediately saw was to keep his eyes from lighting not evenhis taking out his cigarette case and saying before he saidanything else may i smoke she met it for encouragement withher my dear again and then while he struck his match shehad just another minute to be nervous a minute that she made useof however not in the least to falter but to reiterate with ahigh ring a ring that might for all she cared reach the pairinside father father charlotte s great it was not till after he had begun to smoke that he looked ather charlotte s great they could close upon it such a basis as they might immediatelyfeel it make and so they stood together over it quitegratefully each recording to the other s eyes that it was firmunder their feet they had even thus a renewed wait as for proofof it much as if he were letting her see while the minuteslapsed for their concealed companions that this was finally justwhy but just why you see he presently added how right iwas right i mean to do it for you ah rather she murmured with her smile and then as to beherself ideally right i don t see what you would have donewithout her the point was he returned quietly that i didn t see what youwere to do yet it was a risk it was a risk said maggie but i believed in it at least formyself she smiled well now he smoked we see we see i know her better you know her best oh but naturally on which as the warranted truth of it hungin the air the truth warranted as who should say exactly bythe present opportunity to pronounce this opportunity createdand accepted she found herself lost though with a finer thrillthan she had perhaps yet known in the vision of all he mightmean the sense of it in her rose higher rose with each momentthat he invited her thus to see him linger and when after alittle more he had said smoking again and looking up with headthrown back and hands spread on the balcony rail at the grey gaunt front of the house she s beautiful beautiful hersensibility reported to her the shade of a new note it was allshe might have wished for it was with a kind of speakingcompetence the note of possession and control and yet itconveyed to her as nothing till now had done the reality of theirparting they were parting in the light of it absolutely oncharlotte s value the value that was filling the room out ofwhich they had stepped as if to give it play and with which theprince on his side was perhaps making larger acquaintance ifmaggie had desired at so late an hour some last conclusivecomfortable category to place him in for dismissal she mighthave found it here in its all coming back to his ability to restupon high values somehow when all was said and with the memoryof her gifts her variety her power so much remained ofcharlotte s what else had she herself meant three minutes beforeby speaking of her as great great for the world that was beforeher that he proposed she should be she was not to be wasted inthe application of his plan maggie held to this then that shewasn t to be wasted to let his daughter know it he had soughtthis brief privacy what a blessing accordingly that she couldspeak her joy in it his face meanwhile at all events wasturned to her and as she met his eyes again her joy wentstraight it s success father it s success and even this he added as the principino appearing alone deep within piped across an instant greeting even this isn t altogether failure they went in to receive the boy upon whose introduction to theroom by miss bogle charlotte and the prince got up seeminglywith an impressiveness that had caused miss bogle not to givefurther effect to her own entrance she had retired but theprincipino s presence by itself sufficiently broke thetension the subsidence of which in the great room ten minuteslater gave to the air something of the quality produced by thecessation of a sustained rattle stillness when the prince andprincess returned from attending the visitors to their carriage might have been said to be not so much restored as created sothat whatever next took place in it was foredoomed to remarkablesalience that would have been the case even with so natural though so futile a movement as maggie s going out to the balconyagain to follow with her eyes her father s departure thecarriage was out of sight it had taken her too long solemnly toreascend and she looked awhile only at the great grey space onwhich as on the room still more the shadow of dusk had fallen here at first her husband had not rejoined her he had come upwith the boy who clutching his hand abounded as usual inremarks worthy of the family archives but the two appeared thento have proceeded to report to miss bogle it meant something forthe princess that her husband had thus got their son out of theway not bringing him back to his mother but everything now asshe vaguely moved about struck her as meaning so much that theunheard chorus swelled yet this above all her just being thereas she was and waiting for him to come in their freedom to betogether there always was the meaning most disengaged she stoodin the cool twilight and took in all about her where it lurked her reason for what she had done she knew at last really why and how she had been inspired and guided how she had beenpersistently able how to her soul all the while it had beenfor the sake of this end here it was then the moment thegolden fruit that had shone from afar only what were thesethings in the fact for the hand and for the lips when tested when tasted what were they as a reward closer than she had everbeen to the measure of her course and the full face of her act she had an instant of the terror that when there has beensuspense always precedes on the part of the creature to bepaid the certification of the amount amerigo knew it theamount he still held it and the delay in his return making herheart beat too fast to go on was like a sudden blinding light ona wild speculation she had thrown the dice but his hand wasover her cast he opened the door however at last he hadn t been away tenminutes and then with her sight of him renewed to intensity she seemed to have a view of the number his presence alone ashe paused to look at her somehow made it the highest and evenbefore he had spoken she had begun to be paid in full with thatconsciousness in fact an extraordinary thing occurred theassurance of her safety so making her terror drop that already within the minute it had been changed to concern for his ownanxiety for everything that was deep in his being and everythingthat was fair in his face so far as seeing that she was paid went he might have been holding out the money bag for her tocome and take it but what instantly rose for her between theact and her acceptance was the sense that she must strike him aswaiting for a confession this in turn charged her with a newhorror if that was her proper payment she would go withoutmoney his acknowledgment hung there too monstrously at theexpense of charlotte before whose mastery of the greater styleshe had just been standing dazzled all she now knew accordingly was that she should be ashamed to listen to theuttered word all that is but that she might dispose of it onthe spot forever isn t she too splendid she simply said offering it to explainand to finish oh splendid with which he came over to her that s our help you see she added to point further hermoral it kept him before her therefore taking in or trying to whatshe so wonderfully gave he tried too clearly to please her tomeet her in her own way but with the result only that close toher her face kept before him his hands holding her shoulders his whole act enclosing her he presently echoed see i seenothing but you and the truth of it had with this force aftera moment so strangely lighted his eyes that as for pity anddread of them she buried her own in his breast glassesby henry jameschapter iyes indeed i say to myself pen in hand i can keep hold of thethread and let it lead me back to the first impression the littlestory is all there i can touch it from point to point for thethread as i call it is a row of coloured beads on a string noneof the beads are missing at least i think they re not that sexactly what i shall amuse myself with finding out i had been all summer working hard in town and then had gone downto folkestone for a blow art was long i felt and my holidayshort my mother was settled at folkestone and i paid her a visitwhen i could i remember how on this occasion after weeks in mystuffy studio with my nose on my palette i sniffed up the cleansalt air and cooled my eyes with the purple sea the place wasfull of lodgings and the lodgings were at that season full ofpeople people who had nothing to do but to stare at one another onthe great flat down there were thousands of little chairs andalmost as many little jews and there was music in an open rotunda over which the little jews wagged their big noses we all strolledto and fro and took pennyworths of rest the long level cliff top edged in places with its iron rail might have been the deck of ahuge crowded ship there were old folks in bath chairs and therewas one dear chair creeping to its last full stop by the side ofwhich i always walked there was in fine weather the coast offrance to look at and there were the usual things to say about it there was also in every state of the atmosphere our friend mrs meldrum a subject of remark not less inveterate the widow of anofficer in the engineers she had settled like many members of themartial miscellany well within sight of the hereditary enemy whohowever had left her leisure to form in spite of the difference oftheir years a close alliance with my mother she was theheartiest the keenest the ugliest of women the least apologetic the least morbid in her misfortune she carried it high aloft withloud sounds and free gestures made it flutter in the breeze as ifit had been the flag of her country it consisted mainly of a bigred face indescribably out of drawing from which she glared atyou through gold rimmed aids to vision optic circles of suchdiameter and so frequently displaced that some one had vividlyspoken of her as flattering her nose against the glass of herspectacles she was extraordinarily near sighted and whateverthey did to other objects they magnified immensely the kind eyesbehind them blest conveniences they were in their hideous honest strength they showed the good lady everything in the worldbut her own queerness this element was enhanced by wild braveriesof dress reckless charges of colour and stubborn resistances ofcut wondrous encounters in which the art of the toilet seemed tolay down its life she had the tread of a grenadier and the voiceof an angel in the course of a walk with her the day after my arrival i foundmyself grabbing her arm with sudden and undue familiarity i hadbeen struck by the beauty of a face that approached us and i wasstill more affected when i saw the face at the sight of mycompanion open like a window thrown wide a smile fluttered outof it an brightly as a drapery dropped from a sill a draperyshaken there in the sun by a young lady flanked by two young men awonderful young lady who as we drew nearer rushed up to mrs meldrum with arms flourished for an embrace my immediateimpression of her had been that she was dressed in mourning butduring the few moments she stood talking with our friend i mademore discoveries the figure from the neck down was meagre thestature insignificant but the desire to please towered high aswell as the air of infallibly knowing how and of never nevermissing it this was a little person whom i would have made a highbid for a good chance to paint the head the features thecolour the whole facial oval and radiance had a wonderful purity the deep grey eyes the most agreeable i thought that i had everseen brushed with a kind of winglike grace every object theyencountered their possessor was just back from boulogne whereshe had spent a week with dear mrs floyd taylor this accountedfor the effusiveness of her reunion with dear mrs meldrum herblack garments were of the freshest and daintiest she suggested apink and white wreath at a showy funeral she confounded us forthree minutes with her presence she was a beauty of the greatconscious public responsible order the young men her companions gazed at her and grinned i could see there were very few momentsof the day at which young men these or others would not be sooccupied the people who approached took leave of their manners every one seemed to linger and gape when she brought her faceclose to mrs meldrum s and she appeared to be always bringing itclose to somebody s it was a marvel that objects so dissimilarshould express the same general identity the unmistakablecharacter of the english gentlewoman mrs meldrum sustained thecomparison with her usual courage but i wondered why she didn tintroduce me i should have had no objection to the bringing ofsuch a face close to mine however by the time the young ladymoved on with her escort she herself bequeathed me a sense thatsome such rapprochement might still occur was this by reason ofthe general frequency of encounters at folkestone or by reason ofa subtle acknowledgment that she contrived to make of the rights on the part of others that such beauty as hers created i was ina position to answer that question after mrs meldrum had answereda few of mine chapter iiflora saunt the only daughter of an old soldier had lost both herparents her mother within a few months mrs meldrum had knownthem disapproved of them considerably avoided them she hadwatched the girl off and on from her early childhood flora just twenty was extraordinarily alone in the world so alone thatshe had no natural chaperon no one to stay with but a mercenarystranger mrs hammond synge the sister in law of one of the youngmen i had just seen she had lots of friends but none of themnice she kept picking up impossible people the floyd taylors with whom she had been at boulogne were simply horrid thehammond synges were perhaps not so vulgar but they had noconscience in their dealings with her she knows what i think of them said mrs meldrum and indeedshe knows what i think of most things she shares that privilege with most of your friends i repliedlaughing no doubt but possibly to some of my friends it makes a littledifference that girl doesn t care a button she knows best ofall what i think of flora saunt and what may your opinion be why that she s not worth troubling about an idiot too abysmal doesn t she care for that just enough as you saw to hug me till i cry out she s toopleased with herself for anything else to matter surely my dear friend i rejoined she has a good deal to bepleased with so every one tells her and so you would have told her if i hadgiven you the chance however that doesn t signify either forher vanity is beyond all making or mending she believes inherself and she s welcome after all poor dear having onlyherself to look to i ve seldom met a young woman more completelyfree to be silly she has a clear course she ll make a showyfinish well i replied as she probably will reduce many persons to thesame degraded state her partaking of it won t stand out so much if you mean that the world s full of twaddlers i quite agree withyou cried mrs meldrum trumpeting her laugh half across thechannel i had after this to consider a little what she would call mymother s son but i didn t let it prevent me from insisting on hermaking me acquainted with flora saunt indeed i took the bull bythe horns urging that she had drawn the portrait of a nature whichcommon charity now demanded of her to put into relation with acharacter really fine such a frail creature was just an object ofpity this contention on my part had at first of course beenjocular but strange to say it was quite the ground i found myselftaking with regard to our young lady after i had begun to know her i couldn t have said what i felt about her except that she wasundefended from the first of my sitting with her there afterdinner under the stars that was a week at folkestone of balmynights and muffled tides and crowded chairs i became aware boththat protection was wholly absent from her life and that she waswholly indifferent to its absence the odd thing was that she wasnot appealing she was abjectly divinely conceited absurdlyfantastically pleased her beauty was as yet all the world to her a world she had plenty to do to live in mrs meldrum told me moreabout her and there was nothing that as the centre of a group ofgiggling nudging spectators flora wasn t ready to tell aboutherself she held her little court in the crowd upon the grass playing her light over jews and gentiles completely at ease in allpromiscuities it was an effect of these things that from the veryfirst with every one listening i could mention that my mainbusiness with her would be just to have a go at her head and toarrange in that view for an early sitting it would have been asimpossible i think to be impertinent to her as it would have beento throw a stone at a plate glass window so any talk that wentforward on the basis of her loveliness was the most natural thingin the world and immediately became the most general and sociable it was when i saw all this that i judged how though it was thelast thing she asked for what one would ever most have at herservice was a curious compassion that sentiment was coloured bythe vision of the dire exposure of a being whom vanity had put sooff her guard hers was the only vanity i have ever known thatmade its possessor superlatively soft mrs meldrum s furtherinformation contributed moreover to these indulgences her accountof the girl s neglected childhood and queer continentalrelegations with straying squabbling monte carlo haunting parents the more invidious picture above all of her pecuniaryarrangement still in force with the hammond synges who really though they never took her out practically she went out alone hadtheir hands half the time in her pocket she had to pay foreverything down to her share of the wine bills and the horses fodder down to bertie hammond synge s fare in the underground when he went to the city for her she had been left with justmoney enough to turn her head and it hadn t even been put intrust nothing prudent or proper had been done with it she couldspend her capital and at the rate she was going expensive extravagant and with a swarm of parasites to help it certainlywouldn t last very long couldn t you perhaps take her independent unencumbered as youare i asked of mrs meldrum you re probably with oneexception the sanest person she knows and you at least wouldn tscandalously fleece her how do you know what i wouldn t do my humorous friend demanded of course i ve thought how i can help her it has kept me awake atnight but doing it s impossible she ll take nothing from me you know what she does she hugs me and runs away she has aninstinct about me and feels that i ve one about her and then shedislikes me for another reason that i m not quite clear about butthat i m well aware of and that i shall find out some day so faras her settling with me goes it would be impossible moreover here she wants naturally enough a much wider field she must live inlondon her game is there so she takes the line of adoring me ofsaying she can never forget that i was devoted to her mother whichi wouldn t for the world have been and of giving me a wide berth i think she positively dislikes to look at me it s all right there s no obligation though people in general can t take theireyes off me i see that at this moment i replied but what does it matterwhere or how for the present she lives she ll marry infallibly marry early and everything then will change whom will she marry my companion gloomily asked any one she likes she s so abnormally pretty that she can doanything she ll fascinate some nabob or some prince she ll fascinate him first and bore him afterwards moreovershe s not so pretty as you make her out she hasn t a scrap of afigure no doubt but one doesn t in the least miss it not now said mrs meldrum but one will when she s older andwhen everything will have to count when she s older she ll count as a princess so it won t matter she has other drawbacks my companion went on those wonderfuleyes are good for nothing but to roll about like sugar balls whichthey greatly resemble in a child s mouth she can t use them use them why she does nothing else to make fools of young men but not to read or write not to doany sort of work she never opens a book and her maid writes hernotes you ll say that those who live in glass houses shouldn tthrow stones of course i know that if i didn t wear my goggles ishouldn t be good for much do you mean that miss saunt ought to sport such things iexclaimed with more horror than i meant to show i don t prescribe for her i don t know that they re what sherequires what s the matter with her eyes i asked after a moment i don t exactly know but i heard from her mother years ago thateven as a child they had had for a while to put her into spectaclesand that though she hated them and had been in a fury of disgust she would always have to be extremely careful i m sure i hope sheis i echoed the hope but i remember well the impression this madeupon me my immediate pang of resentment a disgust almost equal toflora s own i felt as if a great rare sapphire had split in myhand chapter iiithis conversation occurred the night before i went back to town isettled on the morrow to take a late train so that i had still mymorning to spend at folkestone where during the greater part of iti was out with my mother every one in the place was as usual outwith some one else and even had i been free to go and take leaveof her i should have been sure that flora saunt would not be athome just where she was i presently discovered she was at thefar end of the cliff the point at which it overhangs the prettyview of sandgate and hythe her back however was turned to thisattraction it rested with the aid of her elbows thrust slightlybehind her so that her scanty little shoulders were raised towardher ears on the high rail that inclosed the down two gentlemenstood before her whose faces we couldn t see but who even asobserved from the rear were visibly absorbed in the charmingfigure piece submitted to them i was freshly struck with the factthat this meagre and defective little person with the cock of herhat and the flutter of her crape with her eternal idleness hereternal happiness her absence of moods and mysteries and thepretty presentation of her feet which especially now in thesupported slope of her posture occupied with their imperceptibilityso much of the foreground i was reminded anew i say how ouryoung lady dazzled by some art that the enumeration of her meritsdidn t explain and that the mention of her lapses didn t affect where she was amiss nothing counted and where she was righteverything did i say she was wanting in mystery but that afterall was her secret this happened to be my first chance ofintroducing her to my mother who had not much left in life but thequiet look from under the hood of her chair at the things which when she should have quitted those she loved she could still trustto make the world good for them i wondered an instant how muchshe might be moved to trust flora saunt and then while the chairstood still and she waited i went over and asked the girl to comeand speak to her in this way i saw that if one of flora sattendants was the inevitable young hammond synge master ofceremonies of her regular court always offering the use of atelescope and accepting that of a cigar the other was a personagei had not yet encountered a small pale youth in showyknickerbockers whose eyebrows and nose and the glued points ofwhose little moustache were extraordinarily uplifted and sustained i remember taking him at first for a foreigner and for something ofa pretender i scarce know why unless because of the motive i feltin the stare he fixed on me when i asked miss saunt to come away he struck me a little as a young man practising the social art ofimpertinence but it didn t matter for flora came away withalacrity bringing all her prettiness and pleasure and gliding overthe grass in that rustle of delicate mourning which made theendless variety of her garments as a painter could take heed strike one always as the same obscure elegance she seated herselfon the floor of my mother s chair a little too much on her rightinstep as i afterwards gathered caressing her still hand smilingup into her cold face commending and approving her without areserve and without a doubt she told her immediately as if itwere something for her to hold on by that she was soon to sit tome for a likeness and these words gave me a chance to enquire ifit would be the fate of the picture should i finish it to bepresented to the young man in the knickerbockers her lips atthis parted in a stare her eyes darkened to the purple of one ofthe shadow patches on the sea she showed for the passing instantthe face of some splendid tragic mask and i remembered for theinconsequence of it what mrs meldrum had said about her sight ihad derived from this lady a worrying impulse to catechise her butthat didn t seem exactly kind so i substituted another question inquiring who the pretty young man in knickerbockers might happento be oh a gentleman i met at boulogne he has come over to see me after a moment she added lord iffield i had never heard of lord iffield but her mention of his havingbeen at boulogne helped me to give him a niche mrs meldrum hadincidentally thrown a certain light on the manners of mrs floyd taylor flora s recent hostess in that charming town a lady who it appeared had a special vocation for helping rich young men tofind a use for their leisure she had always one or other in handand had apparently on this occasion pointed her lesson at the rarecreature on the opposite coast i had a vague idea that boulognewas not a resort of the world s envied at the same time theremight very well have been a strong attraction there even for one ofthe darlings of fortune i could perfectly understand in any casethat such a darling should be drawn to folkestone by flora saunt but it was not in truth of these things i was thinking what wasuppermost in my mind was a matter which though it had no sort ofkeeping insisted just then on coming out is it true miss saunt i suddenly demanded that you re sounfortunate as to have had some warning about your beautiful eyes i was startled by the effect of my words the girl threw back herhead changing colour from brow to chin true who in the worldsays so i repented of my question in a flash the way she met itmade it seem cruel and i felt my mother look at me in somesurprise i took care in answer to flora s challenge not toincriminate mrs meldrum i answered that the rumour had reachedme only in the vaguest form and that if i had been moved to put itto the test my very real interest in her must be held responsible her blush died away but a pair of still prettier tears glistenedin its track if you ever hear such a thing said again you cansay it s a horrid lie i had brought on a commotion deeper thanany i was prepared for but it was explained in some degree by thenext words she uttered i m happy to say there s nothing thematter with any part of me whatever not the least little thing she spoke with her habitual complacency with triumphant assurance she smiled again and i could see how she wished that she hadn t sotaken me up she turned it off with a laugh i ve good eyes good teeth a good digestion and a good temper i m sound of windand limb nothing could have been more characteristic than herblush and her tears nothing less acceptable to her than to bethought not perfect in every particular she couldn t submit tothe imputation of a flaw i expressed my delight in what she toldme assuring her i should always do battle for her and as if torejoin her companions she got up from her place on my mother stoes the young men presented their backs to us they were leaningon the rail of the cliff our incident had produced a certainawkwardness and while i was thinking of what next to say sheexclaimed irrelevantly don t you know he ll be lordconsidine at that moment the youth marked for this high destinyturned round and she spoke to my mother i ll introduce him toyou he s awfully nice she beckoned and invited him with herparasol the movement struck me as taking everything for granted i had heard of lord considine and if i had not been able to placelord iffield it was because i didn t know the name of his eldestson the young man took no notice of miss saunt s appeal he onlystared a moment and then on her repeating it quietly turned hisback she was an odd creature she didn t blush at this she onlysaid to my mother apologetically but with the frankest sweetestamusement you don t mind do you he s a monster of shyness it was as if she were sorry for every one for lord iffield thevictim of a complaint so painful and for my mother the subject ofa certain slight i m sure i don t want him said my mother butflora added some promise of how she would handle him for hisrudeness she would clearly never explain anything by any failureof her own appeal there rolled over me while she took leave of usand floated back to her friends a wave of superstitious dread iseemed somehow to see her go forth to her fate and yet what shouldfill out this orb of a high destiny if not such beauty and suchjoy i had a dim idea that lord considine was a great proprietor and though there mingled with it a faint impression that ishouldn t like his son the result of the two images was a whimsicalprayer that the girl mightn t miss her possible fortune chapter ivone day in the course of the following june there was ushered intomy studio a gentleman whom i had not yet seen but with whom i hadbeen very briefly in correspondence a letter from him hadexpressed to me some days before his regret on learning that my splendid portrait of miss flora louisa saunt whose full namefigured by her own wish in the catalogue of the exhibition of theacademy had found a purchaser before the close of the privateview he took the liberty of inquiring whether i might have at hisservice some other memorial of the same lovely head somepreliminary sketch some study for the picture i had replied thati had indeed painted miss saunt more than once and that if he wereinterested in my work i should be happy to show him what i haddone mr geoffrey dawling the person thus introduced to me stumbled into my room with awkward movements and equivocal sounds a long lean confused confusing young man with a bad complexionand large protrusive teeth he bore in its most indelible pressurethe postmark as it were of oxford and as soon as he opened hismouth i perceived in addition to a remarkable revelation of gums that the text of the queer communication matched the registeredenvelope he was full of refinements and angles of dreary anddistinguished knowledge of his unconscious drollery his dressfreely partook it seemed from the gold ring into which his rednecktie was passed to the square toe caps of his boots to conformwith a high sense of modernness to the fashion before the last there were moments when his overdone urbanity all suggestivestammers and interrogative quavers made him scarcely intelligible but i felt him to be a gentleman and i liked the honesty of hiserrand and the expression of his good green eyes as a worshipper at the shrine of beauty however he neededexplaining especially when i found he had no acquaintance with mybrilliant model had on the mere evidence of my picture taken ashe said a tremendous fancy to her looks i ought doubtless tohave been humiliated by the simplicity of his judgment of them ajudgment for which the rendering was lost in the subject quiteleaving out the element of art he was like the innocent readerfor whom the story is really true and the author a negligiblequantity he had come to me only because he wanted to purchase and i remember being so amused at his attitude which i had neverseen equally marked in a person of education that i asked him why for the sort of enjoyment he desired it wouldn t be more to thepoint to deal directly with the lady he stared and blushed atthis the idea clearly alarmed him he was an extraordinary case personally so modest that i could see it had never occurred to him he had fallen in love with a painted sign and seemed content justto dream of what it stood for he was the young prince in thelegend or the comedy who loses his heart to the miniature of theprincess beyond seas until i knew him better this puzzled memuch the link was so missing between his sensibility and his type he was of course bewildered by my sketches which implied in thebeholder some sense of intention and quality but for one of them a comparative failure he ended by conceiving a preference soarbitrary and so lively that taking no second look at the others he expressed his wish to possess it and fell into the extremity ofconfusion over the question of price i helped him over thatstile and he went off without having asked me a direct questionabout miss saunt yet with his acquisition under his arm hisdelicacy was such that he evidently considered his rights to belimited he had acquired none at all in regard to the original ofthe picture there were others for i was curious about him thati wanted him to feel i conceded i should have been glad of hiscarrying away a sense of ground acquired for coming back toensure this i had probably only to invite him and i perfectlyrecall the impulse that made me forbear it operated suddenly fromwithin while he hung about the door and in spite of the diffidentappeal that blinked in his gentle grin if he was smitten withflora s ghost what mightn t be the direct force of the luminarythat could cast such a shadow this source of radiance floodingmy poor place might very well happen to be present the next timehe should turn up the idea was sharp within me that there wererelations and complications it was no mission of mine to bringabout if they were to develop they should develop in their veryown sense let me say at once that they did develop and that i perhaps afterall had something to do with it if mr dawling had departedwithout a fresh appointment he was to reappear six months laterunder protection no less powerful than that of our young ladyherself i had seen her repeatedly for months she had grown toregard my studio as the temple of her beauty this miracle wasrecorded and celebrated there as nowhere else in other placesthere was occasional reference to other subjects of remark thedegree of her presumption continued to be stupefying there wasnothing so extraordinary save the degree in which she never paidfor it she was kept innocent that is she was kept safe by heregotism but she was helped also though she had now put off hermourning by the attitude of the lone orphan who had to be a lawunto herself it was as a lone orphan that she came and went as alone orphan that she was the centre of a crush the neglect of thehammond synges gave relief to this character and she made it worththeir while to be as every one said too shocking lord iffieldhad gone to india to shoot tigers but he returned in time for thepunctual private view it was he who had snapped up as floracalled it the gem of the exhibition my hope for the girl sfuture had slipped ignominiously off his back but after hispurchase of the portrait i tried to cultivate a new faith thegirl s own faith was wonderful it couldn t however be contagious too great was the limit of her sense of what painters call values her colours were laid on like blankets on a cold night how indeedcould a person speak the truth who was always posturing andbragging she was after all vulgar enough and by the time i hadmastered her profile and could almost with my eyes shut do it in asingle line i was decidedly tired of its purity which affectedme at last as inane one moved with her moreover among phenomenamismated and unrelated nothing in her talk ever matched anythingout of it lord iffield was dying of love for her but his familywas leading him a life his mother horrid woman had told someone that she would rather he should be swallowed by a tiger thanmarry a girl not absolutely one of themselves he had given hisyoung friend unmistakable signs but was lying low gaining time it was in his father s power to be both in personal and inpecuniary ways excessively nasty to him his father wouldn t lastfor ever quite the contrary and he knew how thoroughly in spiteof her youth her beauty and the swarm of her admirers some ofthem positively threatening in their passion he could trust her tohold out there were richer cleverer men there were greaterpersonages too but she liked her little viscount just as he was and liked to think that bullied and persecuted he had her thereso gratefully to rest upon she came back to me with tale upontale and it all might be or mightn t i never met my pretty modelin the world she moved it appeared in exalted circles and couldonly admire in her wealth of illustration the grandeur of herlife and the freedom of her hand i had on the first opportunity spoken to her of geoffrey dawling and she had listened to my story so far as she had the art of suchpatience asking me indeed more questions about him than i couldanswer then she had capped my anecdote with others much morestriking the disclosure of effects produced in the mostextraordinary quarters on people who had followed her intorailway carriages guards and porters even who had literally stuckthere others who had spoken to her in shops and hung about herhouse door cabmen upon her honour in london who to gaze theirfill at her had found excuses to thrust their petrifaction throughthe very glasses of four wheelers she lost herself in thesereminiscences the moral of which was that poor mr dawling wasonly one of a million when therefore the next autumn sheflourished into my studio with her odd companion at her heels herfirst care was to make clear to me that if he was now in servitudeit wasn t because she had run after him dawling explained with ahundred grins that when one wished very much to get anything oneusually ended by doing so a proposition which led me wholly todissent and our young lady to asseverate that she hadn t in theleast wished to get mr dawling she mightn t have wished to gethim but she wished to show him and i seemed to read that if shecould treat him as a trophy her affairs were rather at the ebb true there always hung from her belt a promiscuous fringe ofscalps much at any rate would have come and gone since ourseparation in july she had spent four months abroad where onswiss and italian lakes in german cities in the french capital many accidents might have happened chapter vi had been again with my mother but except mrs meldrum and thegleam of france had not found at folkestone my old resources andpastimes mrs meldrum much edified by my report of theperformances as she called them in my studio had told me that toher knowledge flora would soon be on the straw she had cut fromher capital such fine fat slices that there was almost nothing moreleft to swallow perched on her breezy cliff the good lady dazzledme as usual by her universal light she knew so much more abouteverything and everybody than i could ever squeeze out of mycolour tubes she knew that flora was acting on system andabsolutely declined to be interfered with her precious reasoningwas that her money would last as long as she should need it that amagnificent marriage would crown her charms before she should bereally pinched she had a sum put by for a liberal outfit meanwhile the proper use of the rest was to decorate her for theapproaches to the altar keep her afloat in the society in whichshe would most naturally meet her match lord iffield had beenseen with her at lucerne at cadenabbia but it was mrs meldrum sconviction that nothing was to be expected of him but the mostfutile flirtation the girl had a certain hold of him but with agreat deal of swagger he hadn t the spirit of a sheep he was infear of his father and would never commit himself in lordconsidine s lifetime the most flora might achieve was that hewouldn t marry some one else geoffrey dawling to mrs meldrum sknowledge i had told her of the young man s visit had attachedhimself on the way back from italy to the hammond synge group myinformant was in a position to be definite about this dangler sheknew about his people she had heard of him before hadn t he beena friend of one of her nephews at oxford hadn t he spent thechristmas holidays precisely three years before at her brother in law s in yorkshire taking that occasion to get himself refusedwith derision by wilful betty the second daughter of the house her sister who liked the floundering youth had written to her tocomplain of betty and that the young man should now turn up as anappendage of flora s was one of those oft cited proofs that theworld is small and that there are not enough people to go round his father had been something or other in the treasury hisgrandfather on the mother s side had been something or other in thechurch he had come into the paternal estate two or threethousand a year in hampshire but he had let the placeadvantageously and was generous to four plain sisters who lived atbournemouth and adored him the family was hideous all round butthe very salt of the earth he was supposed to be unspeakablyclever he was fond of london fond of books of intellectualsociety and of the idea of a political career that such a manshould be at the same time fond of flora saunt attested as thephrase in the first volume of gibbon has it the variety of hisinclinations i was soon to learn that he was fonder of her thanof all the other things together betty one of five and withviews above her station was at any rate felt at home to havedished herself by her perversity of course no one had looked ather since and no one would ever look at her again it would beeminently desirable that flora should learn the lesson of betty sfate i was not struck i confess with all this in my mind by anysymptom on our young lady s part of that sort of meditation theone moral she saw in anything was that of her incomparable aspect which mr dawling smitten even like the railway porters and thecabmen by the doom dealing gods had followed from london to veniceand from venice back to london again i afterwards learned thather version of this episode was profusely inexact his personalacquaintance with her had been determined by an accident remarkableenough i admit in connexion with what had gone before acoincidence at all events superficially striking at munich returning from a tour in the tyrol with two of his sisters he hadfound himself at the table d hote of his inn opposite to the fullpresentment of that face of which the mere clumsy copy had made himdream and desire he had been tossed by it to a height sovertiginous as to involve a retreat from the board but the nextday he had dropped with a resounding thud at the very feet of hisapparition on the following with an equal incoherence asacrifice even of his bewildered sisters whom he left behind hemade an heroic effort to escape by flight from a fate of which hehad already felt the cold breath that fate in london verylittle later drove him straight before it drove him one sundayafternoon in the rain to the door of the hammond synges hemarched in other words close up to the cannon that was to blow himto pieces but three weeks when he reappeared to me had elapsedsince then yet to vary my metaphor the burden he was to carryfor the rest of his days was firmly lashed to his back i don tmean by this that flora had been persuaded to contract her scope imean that he had been treated to the unconditional snub which asthe event was to show couldn t have been bettered as a means ofsecuring him she hadn t calculated but she had said never andthat word had made a bed big enough for his long legged patience he became from this moment to my mind the interesting figure in thepiece now that he had acted without my aid i was free to show him this and having on his own side something to show me he repeatedlyknocked at my door what he brought with him on these occasionswas a simplicity so huge that as i turn my ear to the past i seemeven now to hear it bumping up and down my stairs that was reallywhat i saw of him in the light of his behaviour he had fallen inlove as he might have broken his leg and the fracture was of asort that would make him permanently lame it was the whole manwho limped and lurched with nothing of him left in the sameposition as before the tremendous cleverness the literarysociety the political ambition the bournemouth sisters all seemedto flop with his every movement a little nearer to the floor ihadn t had an oxford training and i had never encountered the greatman at whose feet poor dawling had most submissively sat and whohad addressed him his most destructive sniffs but i rememberasking myself how effectively this privilege had supposed itself toprepare him for the career on which my friend appeared now to haveembarked i remember too making up my mind about the cleverness which had its uses and i suppose in impenetrable shades even itscritics but from which the friction of mere personal intercoursewas not the sort of process to extract a revealing spark heaccepted without a question both his fever and his chill and theonly thing he touched with judgment was this convenience of myfriendship he doubtless told me his simple story but the mattercomes back in a kind of sense of my being rather the mouthpiece ofmy having had to put it together for him he took it from me inthis form without a groan and i gave it him quite as it came hetook it again and again spending his odd half hours with me as iffor the very purpose of learning how idiotically he was in love he told me i made him see things to begin with hadn t i firstmade him see flora saunt i wanted him to give her up and lucidlyinformed him why on which he never protested nor contradicted never was even so alembicated as to declare just for the sake ofthe point that he wouldn t he simply and pointlessly didn t andwhen at the end of three months i asked him what was the use oftalking with such a fellow his nearest approach to a justificationwas to say that what made him want to help her was just thedeficiencies i dwelt on i could only reply without grossdevelopments oh if you re as sorry for her as that i too wasnearly as sorry for her as that but it only led me to be sorrierstill for other victims of this compassion with dawling as withme the compassion was at first in excess of any visible motive sothat when eventually the motive was supplied each could to acertain extent compliment the other on the fineness of hisforesight after he had begun to haunt my studio miss saunt quite gave it up and i finally learned that she accused me of conspiring with him toput pressure on her to marry him she didn t know i would take itthat way else she would never have brought him to see me it wasin her view a part of the conspiracy that to show him a kindness iasked him at last to sit to me i dare say moreover she wasdisgusted to hear that i had ended by attempting almost as manysketches of his beauty as i had attempted of hers what was thevalue of tributes to beauty by a hand that could so abase itself my relation to poor dawling s want of modelling was simple enough i was really digging in that sandy desert for the buried treasureof his soul chapter viit befell at this period just before christmas that on my havinggone under pressure of the season into a great shop to buy a toy ortwo my eyes fleeing from superfluity lighted at a distance on thebright concretion of flora saunt an exhibitability that held itsown even against the most plausible pinkness of the most developeddolls a huge quarter of the place the biggest bazaar on earth was peopled with these and other effigies and fantasies as well aswith purchasers and vendors haggard alike in the blaze of the gas with hesitations i was just about to appeal to flora to avertthat stage of my errand when i saw that she was accompanied by agentleman whose identity though more than a year had elapsed cameback to me from the folkestone cliff it had been associated onthat scene with showy knickerbockers at present it overflowed moresplendidly into a fur trimmed overcoat lord iffield s presencemade me waver an instant before crossing over and during thatinstant flora blank and undistinguishing as if she too were afterall weary of alternatives looked straight across at me i was onthe point of raising my hat to her when i observed that her facegave no sign i was exactly in the line of her vision but sheeither didn t see me or didn t recognise me or else had a reasonto pretend she didn t was her reason that i had displeased herand that she wished to punish me i had always thought it one ofher merits that she wasn t vindictive she at any rate simplylooked away and at this moment one of the shop girls who hadapparently gone off in search of it bustled up to her with a smallmechanical toy it so happened that i followed closely what thentook place afterwards recognising that i had been led to do so led even through the crowd to press nearer for the purpose by animpression of which in the act i was not fully conscious flora with the toy in her hand looked round at her companion thenseeing his attention had been solicited in another quarter shemoved away with the shop girl who had evidently offered to conducther into the presence of more objects of the same sort when shereached the indicated spot i was in a position still to observeher she had asked some question about the working of the toy andthe girl taking it herself began to explain the little secret flora bent her head over it but she clearly didn t understand isaw her in a manner that quickened my curiosity give a glanceback at the place from which she had come lord iffield wastalking with another young person she satisfied herself of this bythe aid of a question addressed to her own attendant she thendrew closer to the table near which she stood and turning her backto me bent her head lower over the collection of toys and moreparticularly over the small object the girl had attempted toexplain she took it again and after a moment with her face wellaverted made an odd motion of her arms and a significant littleduck of her head these slight signs singular as it may appear produced in my bosom an agitation so great that i failed to noticelord iffield s whereabouts he had rejoined her he was close uponher before i knew it or before she knew it herself i felt at thatinstant the strangest of all promptings if it could have operatedmore rapidly it would have caused me to dash between them in somesuch manner as to give flora a caution in fact as it was i thinki could have done this in time had i not been checked by acuriosity stronger still than my impulse there were three secondsduring which i saw the young man and yet let him come on didn t imake the quick calculation that if he didn t catch what flora wasdoing i too might perhaps not catch it she at any rate herselftook the alarm on perceiving her companion s nearness she made still averted another duck of her head and a shuffle of her handsso precipitate that a little tin steamboat she had been holdingescaped from them and rattled down to the floor with a sharpnessthat i hear at this hour lord iffield had already seized her arm with a violent jerk he brought her round toward him then it wasthat there met my eyes a quite distressing sight this exquisitecreature blushing glaring exposed with a pair of big black rimmed eye glasses defacing her by their position crookedlyastride of her beautiful nose she made a grab at them with herfree hand while i turned confusedly away chapter viii don t remember how soon it was i spoke to geoffrey dawling hissittings were irregular but it was certainly the very next time hegave me one has any rumour ever reached you of miss saunt s having anythingthe matter with her eyes he stared with a candour that was asufficient answer to my question backing it up with a shocked andmystified never then i asked him if he had observed in her anysymptom however disguised of embarrassed sight on which after amoment s thought he exclaimed disguised as if my use of thatword had vaguely awakened a train she s not a bit myopic hesaid she doesn t blink or contract her lids i fully recognisedthis and i mentioned that she altogether denied the impeachment owing it to him moreover to explain the ground of my inquiry igave him a sketch of the incident that had taken place before me atthe shop he knew all about lord iffield that nobleman hadfigured freely in our conversation as his preferred his injuriousrival poor dawling s contention was that if there had been adefinite engagement between his lordship and the young lady thesort of thing that was announced in the morning post renunciationand retirement would be comparatively easy to him but that havingwaited in vain for any such assurance he was entitled to act as ifthe door were not really closed or were at any rate not cruellylocked he was naturally much struck with my anecdote and stillmore with my interpretation of it there is something there is something possibly something verygrave certainly something that requires she should make use ofartificial aids she won t admit it publicly because with heridolatry of her beauty the feeling she is all made up of she seesin such aids nothing but the humiliation and the disfigurement she has used them in secret but that is evidently not enough forthe affection she suffers from apparently some definite menace has lately grown much worse she looked straight at me in theshop which was violently lighted without seeing it was i at thesame distance at folkestone where as you know i first met her where i heard this mystery hinted at and where she indignantlydenied the thing she appeared easily enough to recognise people at present she couldn t really make out anything the shop girlshowed her she has successfully concealed from the man i saw herwith that she resorts in private to a pince nez and that she doesso not only under the strictest orders from her oculist butbecause literally the poor thing can t accomplish without such helphalf the business of life iffield however has suspectedsomething and his suspicions whether expressed or kept tohimself have put him on the watch i happened to have a glimpseof the movement at which he pounced on her and caught her in theact i had thought it all out my idea explained many things anddawling turned pale as he listened to me was he rough with her he anxiously asked how can i tell what passed between them i fled from the place my companion stared do you mean to say her eyesight s going heaven forbid in that case how could she take life as she does how does she take life that s the question he sat therebewilderedly brooding the tears rose to his lids they reminded meof those i had seen in flora s the day i risked my enquiry thequestion he had asked was one that to my own satisfaction i wasready to answer but i hesitated to let him hear as yet all that myreflections had suggested i was indeed privately astonished attheir ingenuity for the present i only rejoined that it struck meshe was playing a particular game at which he went on as if hehadn t heard me suddenly haunted with a fear lost in the darkpossibility do you mean there s a danger of anything very bad my dear fellow you must ask her special adviser who in the world is her special adviser i haven t a conception but we mustn t get too excited myimpression would be that she has only to observe a few ordinaryrules to exercise a little common sense dawling jumped at this i see to stick to the pince nez to follow to the letter her oculist s prescription whatever it isand at whatever cost to her prettiness it s not a thing to betrifled with upon my honour it shan t be he roundly declared and he adjustedhimself to his position again as if we had quite settled thebusiness after a considerable interval while i botched away hesuddenly said did they make a great difference a great difference those things she had put on oh the glasses in her beauty she looked queer of course but itwas partly because one was unaccustomed there are women who lookcharming in nippers what at any rate if she does look queer she must be mad not to accept that alternative she is mad said geoffrey dawling mad to refuse you i grant besides i went on the pince nez which was a large and peculiar one was all awry she had halfpulled it off but it continued to stick and she was crimson shewas angry it must have been horrible my companion groaned it was horrible but it s still more horrible to defy allwarnings it s still more horrible to be landed in withoutsaying in what i disgustedly shrugged my shoulders after a glance at me dawling jerked round then you do believethat she may be i hesitated the thing would be to make her believe it she onlyneeds a good scare but if that fellow is shocked at the precautions she does take oh who knows i rejoined with small sincerity i don t supposeiffield is absolutely a brute i would take her with leather blinders like a shying mare criedgeoffrey dawling i had an impression that iffield wouldn t but i didn t communicateit for i wanted to pacify my friend whom i had discomposed toomuch for the purposes of my sitting i recollect that i did somegood work that morning but it also comes back to me that before weseparated he had practically revealed to me that my anecdote connecting itself in his mind with a series of observations at thetime unconscious and unregistered had covered with light thesubject of our colloquy he had had a formless perception of somesecret that drove miss saunt to subterfuges and the more hethought of it the more he guessed this secret to be the practice ofmaking believe she saw when she didn t and of cleverly keepingpeople from finding out how little she saw when one pieced thingstogether it was astonishing what ground they covered just as hewas going away he asked me from what source at folkestone thehorrid tale had proceeded when i had given him as i saw noreason not to do the name of mrs meldrum he exclaimed oh iknow all about her she s a friend of some friends of mine atthis i remembered wilful betty and said to myself that i knew someone who would probably prove more wilful still chapter viiia few days later i again heard dawling on my stairs and evenbefore he passed my threshold i knew he had something to tell i ve been down to folkestone it was necessary i should see her i forget whether he had come straight from the station he was atany rate out of breath with his news which it took me however aminute to apply you mean that you ve been with mrs meldrum yes to ask her what she knows and how she comes to know it itworked upon me awfully i mean what you told me he made avisible effort to seem quieter than he was and it showed mesufficiently that he had not been reassured i laid to comforthim and smiling at a venture a friendly hand on his arm and hedropped into my eyes fixing them an instant a strange distendedlook which might have expressed the cold clearness of all that wasto come i know now he said with an emphasis he rarely used what then did mrs meldrum tell you only one thing that signified for she has no real knowledge butthat one thing was everything what is it then why that she can t bear the sight of her his pronouns requiredsome arranging but after i had successfully dealt with them ireplied that i was quite aware of miss saunt s trick of turning herback on the good lady of folkestone only what did that prove have you never guessed i guessed as soon as she spoke dawlingtowered over me in dismal triumph it was the first time in ouracquaintance that on any ground of understanding this hadoccurred but even so remarkable an incident still left mesufficiently at sea to cause him to continue why the effect ofthose spectacles i seemed to catch the tail of his idea mrs meldrum s they re so awfully ugly and they add so to the dear woman sugliness this remark began to flash a light and when he quicklyadded she sees herself she sees her own fate my response was soimmediate that i had almost taken the words out of his mouth while i tried to fix this sudden image of flora s face glazed inand cross barred even as mrs meldrum s was glazed and barred hewent on to assert that only the horror of that image looming outat herself could be the reason of her avoiding the person who soforced it home the fact he had encountered made everythinghideously vivid and more vivid than anything else that just suchanother pair of goggles was what would have been prescribed toflora i see i see i presently returned what would become of lordiffield if she were suddenly to come out in them what indeedwould become of every one what would become of everything thiswas an enquiry that dawling was evidently unprepared to meet and icompleted it by saying at last my dear fellow for that matter what would become of you once more he turned on me his good green eyes oh i shouldn tmind the tone of his words somehow made his ugly face beautiful and idiscovered at this moment how much i really liked him none theless at the same time perversely and rudely i felt the drollside of our discussion of such alternatives it made me laugh outand say to him while i laughed you d take her even with thosethings of mrs meldrum s he remained mournfully grave i could see that he was surprised atmy rude mirth but he summoned back a vision of the lady atfolkestone and conscientiously replied even with those things ofmrs meldrum s i begged him not to resent my laughter which butexposed the fact that we had built a monstrous castle in the air didn t he see on what flimsy ground the structure rested theevidence was preposterously small he believed the worst but wewere really uninformed i shall find out the truth he promptly replied how can you if you question her you ll simply drive her toperjure herself wherein after all does it concern you to know thetruth it s the girl s own affair then why did you tell me your story i was a trifle embarrassed to warn you off i smiled he tookno more notice of these words than presently to remark that lordiffield had no serious intentions very possibly i said butyou mustn t speak as if lord iffield and you were her onlyalternatives dawling thought a moment couldn t something be got out of thepeople she has consulted she must have been to people how elsecan she have been condemned condemned to what condemned to perpetual nippers of course shehas consulted some of the big specialists but she has done it youmay be sure in the most clandestine manner and even if it weresupposable that they would tell you anything which i altogetherdoubt you would have great difficulty in finding out which menthey are therefore leave it alone never show her what yoususpect i even before he quitted me asked him to promise me this allright i promise but he was gloomy enough he was a lover facingthe fact that there was no limit to the deceit his loved one wasready to practise it made so remarkably little difference icould see by what a stretch his passionate pity would from thismoment overlook the girl s fatuity and folly she was alwaysaccessible to him that i knew for if she had told him he was anidiot to dream she could dream of him she would have rebuked theimputation of having failed to make it clear that she would alwaysbe glad to regard him as a friend what were most of her friends what were all of them but repudiated idiots i was perfectlyaware that in her conversations and confidences i myself forinstance had a niche in the gallery as regards poor dawling iknew how often he still called on the hammond synges it was notthere but under the wing of the floyd taylors that her intimacywith lord iffield most flourished at all events when a weekafter the visit i have just summarised flora s name was one morningbrought up to me i jumped at the conclusion that dawling had beenwith her and even i fear briefly entertained the thought that hehad broken his word chapter ixshe left me after she had been introduced in no suspense abouther present motive she was on the contrary in a visible fever toenlighten me but i promptly learned that for the alarm with whichshe pitiably panted our young man was not accountable she had butone thought in the world and that thought was for lord iffield ihad the strangest saddest scene with her and if it did me no othergood it at least made me at last completely understand whyinsidiously from the first she had struck me as a creature oftragedy in showing me the whole of her folly it lifted thecurtain of her misery i don t know how much she meant to tell mewhen she came i think she had had plans of elaboratemisrepresentation at any rate she found it at the end of tenminutes the simplest way to break down and sob to be wretched andtrue when she had once begun to let herself go the movement tookher off her feet the relief of it was like the cessation of acramp she shared in a word her long secret she shifted her sharppain she brought i confess tears to my own eyes tears ofhelpless tenderness for her helpless poverty her visit howeverwas not quite so memorable in itself as in some of itsconsequences the most immediate of which was that i went thatafternoon to see geoffrey dawling who had in those days rooms inwelbeck street where i presented myself at an hour late enough towarrant the supposition that he might have come in he had notcome in but he was expected and i was invited to enter and waitfor him a lady i was informed was already in his sitting room i hesitated a little at a loss it had wildly coursed through mybrain that the lady was perhaps flora saunt but when i asked ifshe were young and remarkably pretty i received so significant a no sir that i risked an advance and after a minute in thismanner found myself to my astonishment face to face with mrs meldrum oh you dear thing she exclaimed i m delighted to see you youspare me another compromising demarche but for this i should havecalled on you also know the worst at once if you see me hereit s at least deliberate it s planned plotted shameless i cameup on purpose to see him upon my word i m in love with him why if you valued my peace of mind did you let him the other day atfolkestone dawn upon my delighted eyes i found myself there inhalf an hour simply infatuated with him with a perfect sense ofeverything that can be urged against him i hold him none the lessthe very pearl of men however i haven t come up to declare mypassion i ve come to bring him news that will interest him muchmore above all i ve come to urge upon him to be careful about flora saunt about what he says and does he must be as still as a mouse she s at last really engaged but it s a tremendous secret i was moved to mirth precisely she wired me this noon and spent another shilling totell me that not a creature in the world is yet to know it she had better have spent it to tell you that she had just passedan hour with the creature you see before you she has just passed an hour with every one in the place mrs meldrum cried they ve vital reasons she says for it s notcoming out for a month then it will be formally announced butmeanwhile her rejoicing is wild i daresay mr dawling alreadyknows and as it s nearly seven o clock may have jumped off londonbridge but an effect of the talk i had with him the other day wasto make me on receipt of my telegram feel it to be my duty towarn him in person against taking action so to call it on thehorrid certitude which i could see he carried away with him i hadadded somehow to that certitude he told me what you had told himyou had seen in your shop mrs meldrum i perceived had come to welbeck street on an errandidentical with my own a circumstance indicating her rare sagacity inasmuch as her ground for undertaking it was a very differentthing from what flora s wonderful visit had made of mine iremarked to her that what i had seen in the shop was sufficientlystriking but that i had seen a great deal more that morning in mystudio in short i said i ve seen everything she was mystified everything the poor creature is under the darkest of clouds oh she came totriumph but she remained to talk something in the nature of sense she put herself completely in my hands she does me the honour tointimate that of all her friends i m the most disinterested aftershe had announced to me that lord iffield was utterly committed toher and that for the present i was absolutely the only person inthe secret she arrived at her real business she had had asuspicion of me ever since that day at folkestone when i asked herfor the truth about her eyes the truth is what you and i bothguessed she s in very bad danger but from what cause i who by god s mercy have kept mine knoweverything that can be known about eyes said mrs meldrum she might have kept hers if she had profited by god s mercy ifshe had done in time done years ago what was imperatively orderedher if she hadn t in fine been cursed with the loveliness that wasto make her behaviour a thing of fable she may still keep hersight or what remains of it if she ll sacrifice and after all solittle that purely superficial charm she must do as you ve done she must wear dear lady what you wear what my companion wore glittered for the moment like a melon framein august heaven forgive her now i understand she flushedfor dismay but i wasn t afraid of the effect on her good nature of her thusseeing through her great goggles why it had always been thatflora held her at such a distance i can t tell you i said from what special affection what state of the eye her dangerproceeds that s the one thing she succeeded this morning inkeeping from me she knows it herself perfectly she has had thebest advice in europe it s a thing that s awful simply awful that was the only account she would give me year before last while she was at boulogne she went for three days with mrs floyd taylor to paris she there surreptitiously consulted the greatestman even mrs floyd taylor doesn t know last autumn in germanyshe did the same first put on certain special spectacles with astraight bar in the middle then we ll talk that s practicallywhat they say what she says is that she ll put on anything innature when she s married but that she must get married first she has always meant to do everything as soon as she s married then and then only she ll be safe how will any one ever look ather if she makes herself a fright how could she ever have gotengaged if she had made herself a fright from the first it s nouse to insist that with her beauty she can never be a fright shesaid to me this morning poor girl the most characteristic themost harrowing things my face is all i have and such a face iknew from the first i could do anything with it but i needed itall i need it still every exquisite inch of it it isn t as if ihad a figure or anything else oh if god had only given me afigure too i don t say yes with a figure a really good one like fanny floyd taylor s who s hideous i d have risked plainglasses que voulez vous no one is perfect she says she stillhas money left but i don t believe a word of it she has beenspeculating on her impunity on the idea that her danger would holdoff she has literally been running a race with it her theoryhas been as you from the first so clearly saw that she d get inahead she swears to me that though the bar is too cruel shewears when she s alone what she has been ordered to wear but whenthe deuce is she alone it s herself of course that she hasswindled worst she has put herself off so insanely that even herconceit but half accounts for it with little inadequateconcessions little false measures and preposterous evasions andchildish hopes her great terror is now that iffield who alreadyhas suspicions who has found out her pince nez but whom she hasbeguiled with some unblushing hocus pocus may discover thedreadful facts and the essence of what she wanted this morning wasin that interest to square me to get me to deny indignantly andauthoritatively for isn t she my favourite sitter that she hasanything in life the matter with any part of her she sobbed she went on she entreated after we got talking her extraordinarynerve left her and she showed me what she has been through showedme also all her terror of the harm i could do her wait till i mmarried wait till i m married she took hold of me she almostsank on her knees it seems to me highly immoral one sparticipation in her fraud but there s no doubt that she must bemarried i don t know what i don t see behind it therefore iwound up dawling must keep his hands off mrs meldrum had held her breath she gave out a long moan well that s exactly what i came here to tell him then here he is our host all unprepared his latchkey still inhis hand had just pushed open the door and startled at findingus turned a frightened look from one to the other wondering whatdisaster we were there to announce or avert mrs meldrum was on the spot all gaiety i ve come to return yoursweet visit ah she laughed i mean to keep up theacquaintance do do he murmured mechanically and absently continuing to lookat us then he broke out he s going to marry her i was surprised you already know he produced an evening paper which he tossed down on the table it s in that published already i was still more surprised oh flora can t keep a secret mrs meldrum made it light shewent up to poor dawling and laid a motherly hand upon him it s all right it s just as it ought to be don t think abouther ever any more then as he met this adjuration with a starefrom which thought and of the most defiant and dismal fairlyprotruded the excellent woman put up her funny face and tenderlykissed him on the cheek chapter xi have spoken of these reminiscences as of a row of coloured beads and i confess that as i continue to straighten out my chaplet i amrather proud of the comparison the beads are all there as isaid they slip along the string in their small smooth roundness geoffrey dawling accepted as a gentleman the event his eveningpaper had proclaimed in view of which i snatched a moment to nudgehim a hint that he might offer mrs meldrum his hand he returnedme a heavy head shake and i judged that marriage would henceforthstrike him very much as the traffic of the street may strike somepoor incurable at the window of an hospital circumstances arisingat this time led to my making an absence from england andcircumstances already existing offered him a firm basis for similaraction he had after all the usual resource of a briton he couldtake to his boats always drawn up in our background he startedon a journey round the globe and i was left with nothing but myinference as to what might have happened later observationhowever only confirmed my belief that if at any time during thecouple of months after flora saunt s brilliant engagement he hadmade up as they say to the good lady of folkestone that goodlady would not have pushed him over the cliff strange as she wasto behold i knew of cases in which she had been obliged toadminister that shove i went to new york to paint a couple ofportraits but i found once on the spot that i had countedwithout chicago where i was invited to blot out this harshdiscrimination by the production of some dozen i spent a year inamerica and should probably have spent a second had i not beensummoned back to england by alarming news from my mother herstrength had failed and as soon as i reached london i hurried downto folkestone arriving just at the moment to offer a welcome tosome slight symptom of a rally she had been much worse but wasnow a little better and though i found nothing but satisfaction inhaving come to her i saw after a few hours that my london studio where arrears of work had already met me would be my place toawait whatever might next occur yet before returning to town icalled on mrs meldrum from whom i had not had a line and my viewof whom with the adjacent objects as i had left them had beenintercepted by a luxuriant foreground before i had gained her house i met her as i supposed comingtoward me across the down greeting me from afar with the familiartwinkle of her great vitreous badge and as it was late in theautumn and the esplanade a blank i was free to acknowledge thissignal by cutting a caper on the grass my enthusiasm droppedindeed the next moment for i had seen in a few more seconds thatthe person thus assaulted had by no means the figure of my militaryfriend i felt a shock much greater than any i should have thoughtpossible when on this person s drawing near i knew her for poorlittle flora saunt at what moment she had recognised me belongedto an order of mysteries over which it quickly came home to me one would never linger again once we were face to face it sochiefly mattered that i should succeed in looking entirelyunastonished all i at first saw was the big gold bar crossingeach of her lenses over which something convex and grotesque likethe eyes of a large insect something that now represented herwhole personality seemed as out of the orifice of a prison tostrain forward and press the face had shrunk away it lookedsmaller appeared even to look plain it was at all events so faras the effect on a spectator was concerned wholly sacrificed tothis huge apparatus of sight there was no smile in it and shemade no motion to take my offered hand i had no idea you were down here i said and i wondered whethershe didn t know me at all or knew me only by my voice you thought i was mrs meldrum she ever so quietly answered it was just this low pitch that made me protest with laughter ohyes you have a tremendous deal in common with mrs meldrum i vejust returned to england after a long absence and i m on my way tosee her won t you come with me it struck me that her oldreason for keeping clear of our friend was well disposed of now i ve just left her i m staying with her she stood solemnlyfixing me with her goggles would you like to paint me now sheasked she seemed to speak with intense gravity from behind amask or a cage there was nothing to do but treat the question still with highspirits it would be a fascinating little artistic problem that something was wrong it wasn t difficult to see but a gooddeal more than met the eye might be presumed to be wrong if florawas under mrs meldrum s roof i hadn t for a year had much timeto think of her but my imagination had had ground for lodging herin more gilded halls one of the last things i had heard beforeleaving england was that in commemoration of the new relationshipshe had gone to stay with lady considine this had made me takeeverything else for granted and the noisy american world haddeafened my care to possible contradictions her spectacles wereat present a direct contradiction they seemed a negation not onlyof new relationships but of every old one as well i remembernevertheless that when after a moment she walked beside me on thegrass i found myself nervously hoping she wouldn t as yet at anyrate tell me anything very dreadful so that to stave off thisdanger i harried her with questions about mrs meldrum and withoutwaiting for replies became profuse on the subject of my owndoings my companion was finely silent and i felt both as if shewere watching my nervousness with a sort of sinister irony and asif i were talking to some different and strange person floraplain and obscure and dumb was no flora at all at mrs meldrum sdoor she turned off with the observation that as there wascertainly a great deal i should have to say to our friend she hadbetter not go in with me i looked at her again i had beenkeeping my eyes away from her but only to meet her magnifiedstare i greatly desired in truth to see mrs meldrum alone butthere was something so grim in the girl s trouble that i hesitatedto fall in with this idea of dropping her yet one couldn texpress a compassion without seeming to take for granted moretrouble than there actually might have been i reflected that imust really figure to her as a fool which was an entertainment ihad never expected to give her it rolled over me there for thefirst time it has come back to me since that there is wondrously in very deep and even in very foolish misfortune adignity still finer than in the most inveterate habit of being allright i couldn t have to her the manner of treating it as a meredetail that i was face to face with a part of what at our lastmeeting we had had such a scene about but while i was trying tothink of some manner that i could have she said quite colourlessly though somehow as if she might never see me again good bye i mgoing to take my walk all alone she looked round the great bleak cliff top with whom should igo besides i like to be alone for the present this gave me the glimmer of a vision that she regarded herdisfigurement as temporary and the confidence came to me that shewould never for her happiness cease to be a creature ofillusions it enabled me to exclaim smiling brightly and feelingindeed idiotic oh i shall see you again but i hope you ll havea very pleasant walk all my walks are pleasant thank you they do me such a lot ofgood she was as quiet as a mouse and her words seemed to mestupendous in their wisdom i take several a day she continued she might have been an ancient woman responding with humility atthe church door to the patronage of the parson the more i takethe better i feel i m ordered by the doctors to keep all thewhile in the air and go in for plenty of exercise it keeps up mygeneral health you know and if that goes on improving as it haslately done everything will soon be all right all that was thematter with me before and always it was too reckless was that ineglected my general health it acts directly on the state of theparticular organ so i m going three miles i grinned at her from the doorstep while mrs meldrum s maid stoodthere to admit me oh i m so glad i said looking at her as shepaced away with the pretty flutter she had kept and remembering theday when while she rejoined lord iffield i had indulged in thesame observation her air of assurance was on this occasion notless than it had been on that but i recalled that she had thenstruck me as marching off to her doom was she really now marchingaway from it chapter xias soon as i saw mrs meldrum i of course broke out is thereanything in it is her general health mrs meldrum checked me with her great amused blare you vealready seen her and she has told you her wondrous tale what s in it is what has been in everything she has ever done the mostcomical tragical belief in herself she thinks she s doing a cure and what does her husband think her husband what husband hasn t she then married lord iffield vous en etes le cried my hostess why he behaved like aregular beast how should i know you never wrote me mrs meldrum hesitated covering me with what poor flora called the particular organ no i didn t write you i abstained on purpose if i kept quiet ithought you mightn t hear over there what had happened if youshould hear i was afraid you would stir up mr dawling stir him up urge him to fly to the rescue write out to him that there wasanother chance for him i wouldn t have done it i said well mrs meldrum replied it was not my business to give youan opportunity in short you were afraid of it again she hesitated and though it may have been only my fancy ithought she considerably reddened at all events she laughed out then i was afraid of it she very honestly answered but doesn t he know has he given no sign every sign in life he came straight back to her he dideverything to get her to listen to him but she hasn t the smallestidea of it has he seen her as she is now i presently and just a trifleawkwardly enquired indeed he has and borne it like a hero he told me all aboutit how much you ve all been through i found occasion to remark then what has become of him he s at home in hampshire he has got back his old place and ibelieve by this time his old sisters it s not half a bad littleplace yet its attractions say nothing to flora oh flora s by no means on her back my fried declared she s not on her back because she s on yours have you got herfor the rest of your life once more mrs meldrum genially glared did she tell you how muchthe hammond synges have kindly left her to live on not quiteeighty pounds a year that s a good deal but it won t pay the oculist what was itthat at last induced her to submit to him her general collapse after that brute of an iffield s rupture she cried her eyes out she passed through a horror of blackdarkness then came a gleam of light and the light appears tohave broadened she went into goggles as repentant magdalens gointo the catholic church in spite of which you don t think she ll be saved she thinks she will that s all i can tell you there s no doubtthat when once she brought herself to accept her real remedy asshe calls it she began to enjoy a relief that she had never known that feeling very new and in spite of what she pays for it mostrefreshing has given her something to hold on by begotten in herfoolish little mind a belief that as she says she s on the mendand that in the course of time if she leads a tremendously healthylife she ll be able to take off her muzzle and become as dangerousagain as ever it keeps her going and what keeps you you re good until the parties begin again oh she doesn t object to me now smiled mrs meldrum i m goingto take her abroad we shall be a pretty pair i was struck withthis energy and after a moment i enquired the reason of it it sto divert her mind my friend replied reddening again a little ithought we shall go next week i ve only waited to see how yourmother would be before starting i expressed to her hereupon mysense of her extraordinary merit and also that of theinconceivability of flora s fancying herself still in a situationnot to jump at the chance of marrying a man like dawling shesays he s too ugly she says he s too dreary she says in fact he s nobody mrs meldrum pursued she says above all that he s not her own sort she doesn t deny that he s good but she finds himimpossibly ridiculous he s quite the last person she would everdream of i was almost disposed on hearing this to protest thatif the girl had so little proper feeling her noble suitor hadperhaps served her right but after a while my curiosity as to justhow her noble suitor had served her got the better of that emotion and i asked a question or two which led my companion again to applyto him the invidious term i have already quoted what had happenedwas simply that flora had at the eleventh hour broken down in theattempt to put him off with an uncandid account of her infirmityand that his lordship s interest in her had not been proof againstthe discovery of the way she had practised on him herdissimulation he was obliged to perceive had been infernallydeep the future in short assumed a new complexion for him whenlooked at through the grim glasses of a bride who as he had saidto some one couldn t really when you came to find out see herhand before her face he had conducted himself like any otherjockeyed customer he had returned the animal as unsound he hadbacked out in his own way giving the business by some sharpshuffle such a turn as to make the rupture ostensibly flora s buthe had none the less remorselessly and basely backed out he hadcared for her lovely face cared for it in the amused and hauntedway it had been her poor little delusive gift to make men care andher lovely face damn it with the monstrous gear she had begun torig upon it was just what had let him in he had in the judgmentof his family done everything that could be expected of him he hadmade mrs meldrum had herself seen the letter a handsome offerof pecuniary compensation oh if flora with her incrediblebuoyancy was in a manner on her feet again now it was not that shehad not for weeks and weeks been prone in the dust strange werethe humiliations the forms of anguish it was given some naturesto survive that flora had survived was perhaps after all a proofshe was reserved for some final mercy but she has been in theabysses at any rate said mrs meldrum and i really don t thinki can tell you what pulled her through i think i can tell you i returned what in the world but mrs meldrum at the end of an hour flora had not come in and i was obliged toannounce that i should have but time to reach the station where iwas to find my luggage in charge of my mother s servant mrs meldrum put before me the question of waiting till a later train so as not to lose our young lady but i confess i gave thisalternative a consideration less acute than i pretended somehow ididn t care if i did lose our young lady now that i knew theworst that had befallen her it struck me still less as possible tomeet her on the ground of condolence and with the sad appearanceshe wore to me what other ground was left i lost her but icaught my train in truth she was so changed that one hated to seeit and now that she was in charitable hands one didn t feelcompelled to make great efforts i had studied her face for aparticular beauty i had lived with that beauty and reproduced it but i knew what belonged to my trade well enough to be sure it wasgone for ever chapter xiii was soon called back to folkestone but mrs meldrum and heryoung friend had already left england finding to that end everyconvenience on the spot and not having had to come up to town mythoughts however were so painfully engaged there that i should inany case have had little attention for them the event occurredthat was to bring my series of visits to a close when this hightide had ebbed i returned to america and to my interrupted work which had opened out on such a scale that with a deep plunge intoa great chance i was three good years in rising again to thesurface there are nymphs and naiads moreover in the americandepths they may have had something to do with the duration of mydive i mention them to account for a grave misdemeanor the factthat after the first year i rudely neglected mrs meldrum she hadwritten to me from florence after my mother s death and hadmentioned in a postscript that in our young lady s calculations thelowest figures were now italian counts this was a good omen andif in subsequent letters there was no news of a sequel i wascontent to accept small things and to believe that grave tidings should there be any would come to me in due course the gravityof what might happen to a featherweight became indeed with time anddistance less appreciable and i was not without an impression thatmrs meldrum whose sense of proportion was not the least of hermerits had no idea of boring the world with the ups and downs ofher pensioner the poor girl grew dusky and dim a small fitfulmemory a regret tempered by the comfortable consciousness of howkind mrs meldrum would always be to her i was professionallymore preoccupied than i had ever been and i had swarms of prettyfaces in my eyes and a chorus of loud tones in my ears geoffreydawling had on his return to england written me two or threeletters his last information had been that he was going into thefigures of rural illiteracy i was delighted to receive it and hadno doubt that if he should go into figures they would as they aresaid to be able to prove anything prove at least that my advicewas sound and that he had wasted time enough this quickened on mypart another hope a hope suggested by some roundabout rumour iforget how it reached me that he was engaged to a girl down inhampshire he turned out not to be but i felt sure that if onlyhe went into figures deep enough he would become among the girlsdown in hampshire or elsewhere one of those numerous prizes ofbattle whose defences are practically not on the scale of theirprovocations i nursed in short the thought that it was probablyopen to him to develop as one of the types about whom as the yearsgo on superficial critics wonder without relief how they eversucceeded in dragging a bride to the altar he never alluded toflora saunt and there was in his silence about her quite as inmrs meldrum s an element of instinctive tact a brief implicationthat if you didn t happen to have been in love with her there wasnothing to be said within a week after my return to london i went to the opera ofwhich i had always been much of a devotee i arrived too late forthe first act of lohengrin but the second was just beginning and i gave myself up to it with no more than a glance at the house when it was over i treated myself with my glass from my place inthe stalls to a general survey of the boxes making doubtless ontheir contents the reflections pointed by comparison that aremost familiar to the wanderer restored to london there was thecommon sprinkling of pretty women but i suddenly noted that one ofthese was far prettier than the others this lady alone in one ofthe smaller receptacles of the grand tier and already the aim offifty tentative glasses which she sustained with admirableserenity this single exquisite figure placed in the quarterfurthest removed from my stall was a person i immediately felt to cause one s curiosity to linger dressed in white withdiamonds in her hair and pearls on her neck she had a paleradiance of beauty which even at that distance made her adistinguished presence and with the air that easily attaches tolonely loveliness in public places an agreeable mystery amystery however she remained to me only for a minute after i hadlevelled my glass at her i feel to this moment the startledthrill the shock almost of joy with which i translated her vaguebrightness into a resurrection of flora i say a resurrection because to put it crudely i had on that last occasion left ouryoung woman for dead at present perfectly alive again she wasaltered only as it were by this fact of life a little older alittle quieter a little finer and a good deal fairer she wassimply transfigured by having recovered sustained by thereflection that even her recovery wouldn t enable her todistinguish me in the crowd i was free to look at her well thenit was it came home to me that my vision of her in her greatgoggles had been cruelly final as her beauty was all there was ofher that machinery had extinguished her and so far as i hadthought of her in the interval i had thought of her as buried inthe tomb her stern specialist had built with the sense that shehad escaped from it came a lively wish to return to her and if ididn t straightway leave my place and rush round the theatre and upto her box it was because i was fixed to the spot some momentslonger by the simple inability to cease looking at her she had been from the first of my seeing her practicallymotionless leaning back in her chair with a kind of thoughtfulgrace and with her eyes vaguely directed as it seemed on me toone of the boxes on my side of the house and consequently over myhead and out of my sight the only movement she made for some timewas to finger with an ungloved hand and as if with the habit offondness the row of pearls on her neck which my glass showed me tobe large and splendid her diamonds and pearls in her solitude mystified me making me as she had had no such brave jewels in thedays of the hammond synges wonder what undreamt of improvement hadtaken place in her fortunes the ghost of a question hovered therea moment could anything so prodigious have happened as that onher tested and proved amendment lord iffield had taken her back this could scarce have without my hearing of it and moreover ifshe had become a person of such fashion where was the little courtone would naturally see at her elbow her isolation was puzzling though it could easily suggest that she was but momentarily alone if she had come with mrs meldrum that lady would have takenadvantage of the interval to pay a visit to some other box doubtless the box at which flora had just been looking mrs meldrum didn t account for the jewels but the revival of flora sbeauty accounted for anything she presently moved her eyes overthe house and i felt them brush me again like the wings of a dove i don t know what quick pleasure flickered into the hope that shewould at last see me she did see me she suddenly bent forwardto take up the little double barrelled ivory glass that rested onthe edge of the box and to all appearance fix me with it i smiledfrom my place straight up at the searching lenses and after aninstant she dropped them and smiled as straight back at me oh hersmile it was her old smile her young smile her very own smilemade perfect i instantly left my stall and hurried off for anearer view of it quite flushed i remember as i went with theannoyance of having happened to think of the idiotic way i hadtried to paint her poor iffield with his sample of that error and still poorer dawling in particular with his i hadn t touchedher i was professionally humiliated and as the attendant in thelobby opened her box for me i felt that the very first thing ishould have to say to her would be that she must absolutely sit tome again chapter xiiishe gave me the smile once more as over her shoulder from herchair she turned her face to me here you are again sheexclaimed with her disgloved hand put up a little backward for meto take i dropped into a chair just behind her and having takenit and noted that one of the curtains of the box would make thedemonstration sufficiently private bent my lips over it andimpressed them on its finger tips it was given me however to myastonishment to feel next that all the privacy in the worldcouldn t have sufficed to mitigate the start with which she greetedthis free application of my moustache the blood had jumped to herface she quickly recovered her hand and jerked at me twistingherself round a vacant challenging stare during the next fewinstants several extraordinary things happened the first of whichwas that now i was close to them the eyes of loveliness i had comeup to look into didn t show at all the conscious light i had justbeen pleased to see them flash across the house they showed onthe contrary to my confusion a strange sweet blankness anexpression i failed to give a meaning to until without delay ifelt on my arm directed to it as if instantly to efface the effectof her start the grasp of the hand she had impulsively snatchedfrom me it was the irrepressible question in this grasp thatstopped on my lips all sound of salutation she had mistaken myentrance for that of another person a pair of lips without amoustache she was feeling me to see who i was with theperception of this and of her not seeing me i sat gaping at her andat the wild word that didn t come the right word to express or todisguise my dismay what was the right word to commemorate one ssudden discovery at the very moment too at which one had been mostencouraged to count on better things that one s dear old friendhad gone blind before the answer to this question dropped uponme and the moving moments though few seemed many i heard withthe sound of voices the click of the attendant s key on the otherside of the door poor flora heard also and on hearing still withher hand on my arm brightened again as i had a minute since seenher brighten across the house she had the sense of the return ofthe person she had taken me for the person with the right pair oflips as to whom i was for that matter much more in the dark thanshe i gasped but my word had come if she had lost her sight itwas in this very loss that she had found again her beauty imanaged to speak while we were still alone before her companionhad appeared you re lovelier at this day than you have ever beenin your life at the sound of my voice and that of the opening ofthe door her impatience broke into audible joy she sprang up recognising me always holding me and gleefully cried to agentleman who was arrested in the doorway by the sight of me hehas come back he has come back and you should have heard what hesays of me the gentleman was geoffrey dawling and i thought itbest to let him hear on the spot how beautiful she is my dearman but how extraordinarily beautiful more beautiful at thishour than ever ever before it gave them almost equal pleasure and made dawling blush to hiseyes while this in turn produced in spite of deepenedastonishment a blest snap of the strain i had been strugglingwith i wanted to embrace them both and while the opening bars ofanother scene rose from the orchestra i almost did embrace dawling whose first emotion on beholding me had visibly and ever so oddlybeen a consciousness of guilt i had caught him somehow in theact though that was as yet all i knew but by the time we sanknoiselessly into our chairs again for the music was supreme wagner passed first my demonstration ought pretty well to havegiven him the limit of the criticism he had to fear i myselfindeed while the opera blazed was only too afraid he might divinein our silent closeness the very moral of my optimism which wassimply the comfort i had gathered from seeing that if ourcompanion s beauty lived again her vanity partook of its life ihad hit on the right note that was what eased me off it drew allpain for the next half hour from the sense of the deep darkness inwhich the stricken woman sat if the music in that darkness happily soared and swelled for her it beat its wings in unisonwith those of a gratified passion a great deal came and wentbetween us without profaning the occasion so that i could feel atthe end of twenty minutes as if i knew almost everything he mightin kindness have to tell me knew even why flora while i stared ather from the stalls had misled me by the use of ivory and crystaland by appearing to recognise me and smile she leaned back in herchair in luxurious ease i had from the first become aware thatthe way she fingered her pearls was a sharp image of the weddedstate nothing of old had seemed wanting to her assurance but ihadn t then dreamed of the art with which she would wear thatassurance as a married woman she had taken him when everythinghad failed he had taken her when she herself had done so hisembarrassed eyes confessed it all confessed the deep peace hefound in it they only didn t tell me why he had not written tome nor clear up as yet a minor obscurity flora after a whileagain lifted the glass from the ledge of the box and elegantlyswept the house with it then by the mere instinct of her grace a motion but half conscious she inclined her head into the voidwith the sketch of a salute producing i could see a perfectimitation of response to some homage dawling and i looked at eachother again the tears came into his eyes she was playing atperfection still and her misfortune only simplified the process i recognised that this was as near as i should ever come certainlyas i should come that night to pressing on her misfortune neither of us would name it more than we were doing then and florawould never name it at all little by little i saw that what hadoccurred was strange as it might appear the best thing for herhappiness the question was now only of her beauty and her beingseen and marvelled at with dawling to do for her everything inlife her activity was limited to that such an activity was allwithin her scope it asked nothing of her that she couldn tsplendidly give as from time to time in our delicate communionshe turned her face to me with the parody of a look i lost none ofthe signs of its strange new glory the expression of the eyes wasa rub of pastel from a master s thumb the whole head stamped witha sort of showy suffering had gained a fineness from what she hadpassed through yes flora was settled for life nothing couldhurt her further i foresaw the particular praise she would mostlyincur she would be invariably interesting she would charm withher pathos more even than she had charmed with her pleasure forherself above all she was fixed for ever rescued from all changeand ransomed from all doubt her old certainties her old vanitieswere justified and sanctified and in the darkness that had closedupon her one object remained clear that object as unfading as amosaic mask was fortunately the loveliest she could possibly lookupon the greatest blessing of all was of course that dawlingthought so her future was ruled with the straightest line and sofor that matter was his there were two facts to which before ileft my friends i gave time to sink into my spirit one was thathe had changed by some process as effective as flora s change hadbeen simplified somehow into service as she had been simplifiedinto success he was such a picture of inspired intervention as ihad never yet conceived he would exist henceforth for the solepurpose of rendering unnecessary or rather impossible anyreference even on her own part to his wife s infirmity oh yes how little desire he would ever give me to refer to it heprincipally after a while made me feel and this was my secondlesson that good natured as he was my being there to see it alloppressed him so that by the time the act ended i recognised thati too had filled out my hour dawling remembered things i thinkhe caught in my very face the irony of old judgments they madehim thresh about in his chair i said to flora as i took leave ofher that i would come to see her but i may mention that i neverwent i d go to morrow if i hear she wants me but what in theworld can she ever want as i quitted them i laid my hand ondawling s arm and drew him for a moment into the lobby why did you never write to me of your marriage he smiled uncomfortably showing his long yellow teeth andsomething more i don t know the whole thing gave me such atremendous lot to do this was the first dishonest speech i had heard him make hereally hadn t written because an idea that i would think him astill bigger fool than before i didn t insist but i tried therein the lobby so far as a pressure of his hand could serve me togive him a notion of what i thought him i can t at any rate makeout i said why i didn t hear from mrs meldrum she didn t write to you never a word what has become of her i think she s at folkestone dawling returned but i m sorry tosay that practically she has ceased to see us you haven t quarrelled with her how could we think of all we owe her at the time of ourmarriage and for months before she did everything for us idon t know how we should have managed without her but since thenshe has never been near us and has given us rather markedly littleencouragement to keep up relations with her i was struck with this though of course i admit i am struck withall sorts of things well i said after a moment even if icould imagine a reason for that attitude it wouldn t explain whyshe shouldn t have taken account of my natural interest just so dawling s face was a windowless wall he couldcontribute nothing to the mystery and quitting him i carried itaway it was not till i went down to ace mrs meldrum that wasreally dispelled she didn t want to hear of them or to talk ofthem not a bit and it was just in the same spirit that she hadn twanted to write of them she had done everything in the world forthem but now thank heaven the hard business was over after ihad taken this in which i was quick to do we quite avoided thesubject she simply couldn t bear it
